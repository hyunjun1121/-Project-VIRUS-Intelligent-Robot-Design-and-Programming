Which is the molecular target of the immunosuppressant drug Rapamycin?

[PMID: 14508096]
The molecular target of rapamycin (mTOR), which is a member of the phosphoinositide 3-kinase related kinase (PIKK) family and a central modulator of cell growth, is a prime strategic target for anti-cancer therapeutic development. mTOR plays a critical role in transducing proliferative signals mediated through the phosphatidylinositol 3 kinase (PI3K)/protein kinase B (Akt) signaling pathway, principally by activating downstream protein kinases that are required for both ribosomal biosynthesis and translation of key mRNAs of proteins required for G(1) to S phase traverse. By targeting mTOR, the immunsuppressant and antiproliferative agent rapamycin (RAP) inhibits signals required for cell cycle progression, cell growth, and proliferation. RAP, a complex macrolide and highly potent fungicide, immunosuppressant, and anti-cancer agent, is a highly specific inhibitor of mTOR. In essence, RAP gains function by binding to the immunophilin FK506 binding protein 12 (FKBP12) and the resultant complex inhibits the activity of mTOR. Since mTOR activates both the 40S ribosomal protein S6 kinase ((p)70(s6k)) and the eukaryotic initiation factor 4E-binding protein-1 (4E-BP1), RAP blocks activation of these downstream signaling elements, which results in cell cycle arrest in the G1 arrest. RAP also prevents cyclin-dependent kinase (cdk) activation, inhibits retinoblastoma protein ((p)Rb) phosphorylation, and accelerates the turnover of cyclin D1 that leads to a deficienciy of active cdk4/cyclin D1 complexes, all of which potentially contribute to the prominent inhibitory effects of RAP at the G(1)/S phase transition. Both RAP and several RAP analogs with more favorable pharmaceutical properties have demonstrated prominent growth inhibitory effects against a broad range of human cancers in both preclinical and early clinical evaluations. This review will summarize the principal mechanisms of action of RAP and RAP derivatives and their potential utility of these agents as anti-cancer therapeutics. The preliminary results of early clinical evaluations with RAP analogs and the unique developmental challenges that lie ahead will also be discussed.

Farnesyl protein transferase inhibitors (FTIs) have demonstrated clinical activity in certain solid tumors and hematological malignancies. Little is known about mechanisms of resistance to these agents. To provide a basis for better understanding FTI resistance, the colorectal carcinoma cell line HCT 116 was selected by stepwise exposure to increasing 4-(2-(4-(8-chloro-3,10-dibromo-6,11-dihydro-5H-benzo-(5,6)-cyclohepta(1,2-b)-pyridin-11(R)-yl)-1-piperidinyl)-2-oxo-ethyl)-1-piperidinecarboxamide (SCH66336) concentrations. The resulting line, HCT 116R, was 100-fold resistant to SCH66336 and other FTIs, including methyl {N-[2-phenyl-4-N[2(R)-amino-3-mercaptopropylamino] benzoyl]}-methionate (FTI-277), but was less than 2-fold resistant to the standard agents gemcitabine, cisplatin, and paclitaxel. Accumulation of the unfarnesylated forms of prelamin A and HDJ-2, two substrates that reflect farnesyl transferase inhibition, was similar in FTI-treated parental and HCT 116R cells, indicating that alterations in drug uptake or inhibition of farnesyl protein transferase is not the mechanism of resistance. Changes in signal-transduction pathways that might account for this resistance were examined by immunoblotting and confirmed pharmacologically. There was no difference in activation of the mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase (MEK)/extracellular signal-regulated kinase pathway or sensitivity to the MEK1/2 inhibitor 2'-amino-3'-methoxyflavone (PD98059) in HCT 116R cells. In contrast, increased phosphorylation of the molecular target of rapamycin (mTOR) and its downstream target p70 S6 kinase and increased levels of Akt1 and Akt2 were demonstrated in HCT 116R cells. Further experiments demonstrated that the mTOR inhibitor rapamycin selectively sensitized HCT 116R cells to SCH66336 but not to gemcitabine, cisplatin, or paclitaxel. These findings provide evidence that alterations in the phosphatidylinositol-3 kinase/Akt pathway can contribute to FTI resistance and suggest a potential strategy for overcoming this resistance.

Cutaneous malignant melanoma is the most aggressive form of skin cancer with an extremely poor survival rate for the patients diagnosed with locally invasive and metastatic disease states. Intensive research has led in last few years to an improvement of the early detection and curative treatment of primary cutaneous melanomas that are confined to the skin by tumor surgical resection. However, locally advanced and disseminated melanomas are generally resistant to conventional treatments, including ionizing radiation, systemic chemotherapy, immunotherapy and/or adjuvant stem cell-based therapies, and result in the death of patients. The rapid progression of primary melanomas to locally invasive and/or metastatic disease states remains a major obstacle for an early effective diagnosis and a curative therapeutic intervention for melanoma patients. Importantly, recent advances in the melanoma research have led to the identification of different gene products that are often implicated in the malignant transformation of melanocytic cells into melanoma cells, including melanoma stem/progenitor cells, during melanoma initiation and progression to locally advanced and metastatic disease states. The frequent deregulated genes products encompass the oncogenic B-RafV600E and N-RasQ61R mutants, different receptor tyrosine kinases and developmental pathways such as epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR), stem cell-like factor (SCF) receptor KIT, hedgehog, Wnt/β-catenin, Notch, stromal cell-derived factor-1 (SDF-1)/CXC chemokine receptor-4 (CXCR4) and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF)/VEGFR receptor. These growth factors can cooperate to activate distinct tumorigenic downstream signaling elements and epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT)-associated molecules, including phosphatidylinositol 3'-kinase (PI3K)/Akt/ molecular target of rapamycin (mTOR), nuclear factor-kappaB (NF-κB), macrophage inhibitory cytokine-1 (MIC-1), vimentin, snail and twist. Of therapeutic relevance, these deregulated signal transduction components constitute new potential biomarkers and therapeutic targets of great clinical interest for improving the efficacy of current diagnostic and prognostic methods and management of patients diagnosed with locally advanced, metastatic and/or relapsed melanomas.

The phosphatidylinositol 3'-kinase (PI3K)/AKT/molecular target of rapamycin (mTOR) pathway is involved in the development of tumor resistance to endocrine therapy in breast cancer cell lines and represents an attractive target for pharmacologic intervention. However, the effects of endocrine therapy with aromatase inhibitors on in vivo expression of this signaling cascade, and its relation to tumor response and patient outcome, is unknown. PI3K, phospho-AKT (pAKT) and phospho-mTOR were assessed by immunohistochemistry on tumor specimens collected at baseline and after 6 months of treatment in 113 elderly breast cancer patients consecutively enrolled in a randomized phase II trial of primary letrozole therapy and letrozole associated with metronomic cyclophosphamide. Basal expression of the pathway was not significantly correlated with response or patient outcome. Both letrozole alone and letrozole with cyclophosphamide resulted in a significant reduction of PI3K expression (P = 0.02 and P < 0.005, respectively) and phospho-mTOR expression (P = 0.0001 and P = 0.0001, respectively). pAKT showed no change in the letrozole arm, whereas it was significantly decreased in the letrozole plus cyclophosphamide arm (P < 0.005). pAKT expression reduction was associated with a greater response rate (P = 0.05) and greater reduction in Ki67 expression (P = 0.05). Phospho-mTOR expression reduction was associated with a significantly longer disease-free survival in a multivariate analysis (P = 0.02). Letrozole inhibits key molecules in the PI3K pathway that are important targets of new drugs being developed to overcome resistance. Changes in these molecules may have prognostic significance. These results should be taken into account when planning prospective trials testing up-front aromatase inhibitor with drugs targeting the PI3K/AKT/mTOR signaling pathway.

Recent studies in the field of cancer stem cells have revealed that the alterations in key gene products involved in the epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) program, altered metabolic pathways such as enhanced glycolysis, lipogenesis and/or autophagy and treatment resistance may occur in cancer stem/progenitor cells and their progenies during cancer progression. Particularly, the sustained activation of diverse developmental cascades such as hedgehog, epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR), Wnt/β-catenin, Notch, transforming growth factor-β (TGF-β)/TGF-βR receptors and/or stromal cell-derived factor-1 (SDF-1)/CXC chemokine receptor 4 (CXCR4) can play critical functions for high self-renewal potential, survival, invasion and metastases of cancer stem/progenitor cells and their progenies. It has also been observed that cancer cells may be reprogrammed to re-express different pluripotency-associated stem cell-like markers such as Myc, Oct-3/4, Nanog and Sox-2 along the EMT process and under stressful and hypoxic conditions. Moreover, the enhanced expression and/or activities of some drug resistance-associated molecules such as Bcl-2, Akt/molecular target of rapamycin (mTOR), nuclear factor-kappaB (NF-κB), hypoxia-inducible factors (HIFs), macrophage inhibitory cytokine-1 (MIC-1) and ATP-binding cassette (ABC) multidrug transporters frequently occur in cancer cells during cancer progression and metastases. These molecular events may cooperate for the survival and acquisition of a more aggressive and migratory behavior by cancer stem/progenitor cells and their progenies during cancer transition to metastatic and recurrent disease states. Of therapeutic interest, these altered gene products may also be exploited as molecular biomarkers and therapeutic targets to develop novel multitargeted strategies for improving current cancer therapies and preventing disease relapse.

The molecular target of rapamycin, which is a member of the phosphoinositide 3-kinase related kinase family and a central modulator of cell growth, is a unique and prime strategic target for anticancer therapeutic development. The molecular target of rapamycin plays a critical role in transducing proliferative signals mediated through the phosphatidylinositol 3 kinase and protein kinase B signaling pathways, principally by activating downstream protein kinases that are required for both ribosomal biosynthesis and translation of mRNAs of proteins that are essential for G1 to S phase traverse. By targeting the molecular target of rapamycin with high potency and specificity, the immunosuppressant and antiproliferative agent rapamycin inhibits signals required for cell cycle progression, cell growth, and proliferation. Both rapamycin and several rapamycin analogs with more favorable pharmaceutical properties have demonstrated impressive growth inhibitory effects against a broad range of human cancers in both preclinical and early clinical evaluations. This review discusses recent findings regarding the principal mechanisms of action of the rapamycins, the potential utility of these agents as anticancer therapeutics, clinical results to date, and developmental challenges that lie ahead.

Accumulating lines of experimental evidence have revealed that hypoxia-inducible factors, HIF-1α and HIF-2α, are key regulators of the adaptation of cancer- and metastasis-initiating cells and their differentiated progenies to oxygen and nutrient deprivation during cancer progression under normoxic and hypoxic conditions. Particularly, the sustained stimulation of epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR), insulin-like growth factor-1 receptor (IGF-1R), stem cell factor (SCF) receptor KIT, transforming growth factor-β receptors (TGF-βRs) and Notch and their downstream signalling elements such as phosphatidylinositol 3'-kinase (PI3K)/Akt/molecular target of rapamycin (mTOR) may lead to an enhanced activity of HIFs. Moreover, the up-regulation of HIFs in cancer cells may also occur in the hypoxic intratumoral regions formed within primary and secondary neoplasms as well as in leukaemic cells and metastatic prostate and breast cancer cells homing in the hypoxic endosteal niche of bone marrow. The activated HIFs may induce the expression of numerous gene products such as induced pluripotency-associated transcription factors (Oct-3/4, Nanog and Sox-2), glycolysis- and epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) programme-associated molecules, including CXC chemokine receptor 4 (CXCR4), snail and twist, microRNAs and angiogenic factors such as vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF). These gene products in turn can play critical roles for high self-renewal ability, survival, altered energy metabolism, invasion and metastases of cancer cells, angiogenic switch and treatment resistance. Consequently, the targeting of HIF signalling network and altered metabolic pathways represents new promising strategies to eradicate the total mass of cancer cells and improve the efficacy of current therapies against aggressive and metastatic cancers and prevent disease relapse.

Endocrine therapy is the most effective systemic treatment for patients with hormone-receptor-positive (HR(+)) breast cancer. Unfortunately, efficacy is often limited by the onset of resistance, which is almost inevitable for patients with advanced disease. Several patterns of endocrine resistance are recognizable clinically, including: A) tumors that are inherently insensitive to all attempts at estrogen receptor (ER) targeting despite expression of ER (pan-endocrine therapy resistance); B) tumors that are estrogen dependent but resistant to one or more specific endocrine therapies (agent-selective resistance); and C) tumors that initially respond but subsequently progress (acquired resistance). Current insights into the molecular basis for these resistance patterns are rudimentary, but are most clearly illuminated by investigations that focus on the crosstalk between the ErbB or HER peptide growth factor family and the ER. The data are sufficiently compelling to be addressed by ongoing clinical trials that examine combinations of endocrine agents and either trastuzumab (Herceptin; Genentech, Inc.; South San Francisco, CA) or ErbB-specific tyrosine kinase (TK) inhibitors. Preliminary data from a small "proof of concept" phase II study of letrozole (Femara; Novartis Pharmaceuticals Corporation; East Hanover, NJ) and trastuzumab demonstrated durable responses despite tamoxifen (Nolvadex; AstraZeneca Pharmaceuticals; Wilmington, DE) resistance. Efficacy was variable, however, despite the selection of patients on the basis of ER and ErbB-2 coexpression. Complicating matters further, resistance often occurs in the absence of any evidence for ErbB TK family member expression. In the absence of a clear target, common downstream signal transduction proteins that are known to intersect with the ER pathway can be inhibited to address resistance, including G proteins with farnesyltransferase inhibitors and molecular target of rapamycin (mTOR) with rapamycin analogues. With a number of phase III clinical trials now under way, major advances in the endocrine treatment of advanced disease are possible.

This study examined how L-leucine affected DNA synthesis and cell cycle regulatory protein expression in cultured primary chicken hepatocytes. L-Leucine promoted DNA synthesis in a dose- and time-dependent manner, with concomitant increases in cyclin D1 and cyclin E expression. Phospholipase C (PLC) and protein kinase C (PKC) mediated the L-leucine-induced increases in [3H]-thymidine incorporation and cyclin D1/CDK4 and cyclin E/CDK2 expression, as U73122 (a PLC inhibitor) or bisindolylmaleimide I (a PKC blocker) inhibited these effects. L-Leucine also increased PKC phosphorylation and intracellular Ca2+ levels. L-Leucine-mediated increases in [3H]-thymidine incorporation and cyclin/CDK expression were sensitive to LY 294002 (PI3K inhibitor), Akt inhibitor, PD 98059 (MEK inhibitor). It was also observed that L-leucine-induced increases of cyclin/CDK expression were inhibited by PI3K siRNA and ERK siRNA; L-leucine increased extracellular signal-regulated kinases 1/2 (ERK1/2) and Akt phosphorylation levels. Bisindolylmaleimide I attenuated L-leucine-induced phosphorylation of ERK1/2 but did not influence Akt phosphorylation, and PI3K siRNA and LY 294002 inhibited L-leucine-induced ERK1/2 phosphorylation, suggesting some cross-talk between the PKC and ERK1/2 or PI3K/Akt and ERK1/2 pathways. L-Leucine also increased the levels of phosphorylated molecular target of rapamycin (mTOR) and two of its targets, ribosomal protein S6 kinase (p70S6K), and 4E binding protein 1 (4E-BP1); furthermore, rapamycin (an mTOR inhibitor) blocked all of the mitogenic effects of L-leucine. In addition, Akt inhibitor blocked L-leucine-induced mTOR phosphorylation. In conclusion, L-leucine stimulated DNA synthesis and promoted cell cycle progression in primary cultured chicken hepatocytes through PKC, ERK1/2, PI3K/Akt, and mTOR.

The molecular target of rapamycin (mTOR) is central to a complex intracellular signaling pathway and is involved in diverse processes including cell growth and proliferation, angiogenesis, autophagy, and metabolism. Although sirolimus (rapamycin), the oldest inhibitor of mTOR, was discovered more than 30 years ago, renewed interest in this pathway is evident by the numerous rapalogs recently developed. These newer agents borrow from the structure of sirolimus and, although there are some pharmacokinetic differences, they appear to differ little in terms of pharmacodynamic effects and overall tolerability. Given the multitude of potential applications for this class of agents and the decrease in cost that can be expected upon the expiration of sirolimus patents, renewed focus on this agent is warranted.

The story of rapamycin is a pharmaceutical fairytale. Discovered as an antifungal activity in a soil sample collected on Easter Island, this macrocyclic lactone and its derivatives are now billion dollar drugs, used in, and being evaluated for, a number of clinical applications. Taking advantage of its antifungal property, the molecular Target Of Rapamycin, TOR, was first described in the budding yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae. TORs encode large, Ser/Thr protein kinases that reside in two distinct, structurally and functionally conserved, multi-protein complexes. In yeast, these complexes coordinate many different aspects of cell growth. TOR complex 1, TORC1, promotes protein synthesis and other anabolic processes, while inhibiting macroautophagy and other catabolic and stress-response processes. TORC2 primarily regulates cell polarity, although additional readouts of this complex are beginning to be characterized. TORC1 appears to be activated by nutrient cues and inhibited by stresses and rapamycin; however, detailed mechanisms are not known. In contrast, TORC2 is insensitive to rapamycin and physiological regulators of this complex have yet to be defined. Given the unsurpassed resources available to yeast researchers, this simple eukaryote continues to contribute to our understanding of eukaryotic cell growth in general and TOR function in particular.

The molecular target of rapamycin (mTOR) is up-regulated in glioblastoma (GBM) and this is associated with the rate of cell growth, stem cell proliferation and disease relapse. Rapamycin is a powerful mTOR inhibitor and strong autophagy inducer. Previous studies analyzed the effects of rapamycin in GBM cell lines. However, to our knowledge, no experiment was carried out to evaluate the effects of rapamycin neither in primary cells derived from GBM patients nor in vivo in brain GBM xenograft. These data are critical to get a deeper insight into the effects of such adjuvant therapy in GBM patients. In the present study, various doses of rapamycin were tested in primary cell cultures from GBM patients. These effects were compared with that obtained by the same doses of rapamycin in GBM cell lines (U87Mg). The effects of rapamycin were also evaluated in vivo, in brain tumors developed from mouse xenografts. Rapamycin, starting at the dose of 10nm inhibited cell growth both in U87Mg cell line and primary cell cultures derived from various GBM patients. When administered in vivo to brain xenografts in nude mice rapamycin almost doubled the survival time of mice and inhibited by more than 95% of tumor volume.
