The 1,4-benzothiazepine derivative JTV-519 is a new type of calcium ion channel modulator. We examined the modulatory effect of JTV-519 on the antitumor activity of several platinum compounds (cisplatin, carboplatin, and nedaplatin) in a human cancer cell line resistant to cisplatin (PC-14 / CDDP) in vitro. PC-14 / CDDP cells showed 8-fold resistance to cisplatin compared with the parental PC-14 cells as determined by dye formation [3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide, MTT] assay. In PC-14 / CDDP, but not PC-14 cells, augmentation of cytotoxicity was observed when a nontoxic concentration (10 mM) of JTV-519 was combined with the platinum compounds. Increased intracellular cisplatin accumulation was observed in PC-14 / CDDP cells in the presence of JTV-519 as measured by atomic absorption assay. Therefore, increased cisplatin accumulation was considered to be a possible mechanism underlying the reversing effect of JTV-519 on cisplatin resistance. These results suggest that JTV-519 is a potent agent reversing cisplatin resistance.

Japan Tobacco is developing the mixed action ion channel blocker, JTV-519, which has potential use as an antiarrhythmic [285800]. The drug is a novel cardioprotectant derivative of 1,4-benzothiazepine for which phase I trials were completed in the third quarter of 1998; phase II trials started in the fourth quarter of 1998 for the potential treatment of myocardial infarction [320195]. Studies have shown that JTV-519 has a strong cardioprotective effect against catecholamine-induced myocardial injury and against ischemia/reperfusion injury [316749]. In experimental myofibrillar overcontraction models, it demonstrated greater cardioprotectant effects than propranolol, verapamil and diltiazem [171668].

New drugs with enhanced electron donor properties that target the ryanodine receptor from skeletal muscle sarcoplasmic reticulum (RyR1) are shown to be potent inhibitors of single-channel activity. In this article, we synthesize derivatives of the channel activator 4-chloro-3-methyl phenol (4-CmC) and the 1,4-benzothiazepine channel inhibitor 4-[-3{1-(4-benzyl) piperidinyl}propionyl]-7-methoxy-2,3,4,5-tetrahydro-1,4-benzothiazepine (K201, JTV519) with enhanced electron donor properties. Instead of activating channel activity (~100 μM), the 4-methoxy analog of 4-CmC [4-methoxy-3-methyl phenol (4-MmC)] inhibits channel activity at submicromolar concentrations (IC(50) = 0.34 ± 0.08 μM). Increasing the electron donor characteristics of K201 by synthesizing its dioxole congener results in an approximately 16 times more potent RyR1 inhibitor (IC(50) = 0.24 ± 0.05 μM) compared with K201 (IC(50) = 3.98 ± 0.79 μM). Inhibition is not caused by an increased closed time of the channel but seems to be caused by an open state block of RyR1. These alterations to chemical structure do not influence the ability of these drugs to affect Ca(2+)-dependent ATPase activity of sarcoplasmic/endoplasmic reticulum Ca(2+)-ATPase type 1. Moreover, the FKBP12 protein, which stabilizes RyR1 in a closed configuration, is shown to be a strong electron donor. It seems as if FKBP12, K201, its dioxole derivative, and 4-MmC inhibit RyR1 channel activity by virtue of their electron donor characteristics. These results embody strong evidence that designing new drugs to target RyR1 with enhanced electron donor characteristics results in more potent channel inhibitors. This is a novel approach to the design of new, more potent drugs with the aim of functionally modifying RyR1 single-channel activity.

K201 (JTV519), a benzothiazepine derivative, has been shown to possess anti-arrhythmic and cardioprotective properties, but the mechanism of its action is both complex and controversial. It is believed to stabilize the closed state of the RyR2 (cardiac ryanodine receptor) by increasing its affinity for the FKBP12.6 (12.6 kDa FK506 binding protein) [Wehrens, Lehnart, Reiken, Deng, Vest, Cervantes, Coromilas, Landry and Marks (2004) Science 304, 292-296]. In the present study, we investigated the effect of K201 on spontaneous Ca2+ release induced by Ca2+ overload in rat ventricular myocytes and in HEK-293 cells (human embryonic kidney cells) expressing RyR2 and the role of FKBP12.6 in the action of K201. We found that K201 abolished spontaneous Ca2+ release in cardiac myocytes in a concentration-dependent manner. Treating ventricular myocytes with FK506 to dissociate FKBP12.6 from RyR2 did not affect the suppression of spontaneous Ca2+ release by K201. Similarly, K201 was able to suppress spontaneous Ca2+ release in FK506-treated HEK-293 cells co-expressing RyR2 and FKBP12.6. Furthermore, K201 suppressed spontaneous Ca2+ release in HEK-293 cells expressing RyR2 alone and in cells co-expressing RyR2 and FKBP12.6 with the same potency. In addition, K201 inhibited [3H]ryanodine binding to RyR2-wt (wild-type) and an RyR2 mutant linked to ventricular tachycardia and sudden death, N4104K, in the absence of FKBP12.6. These observations demonstrate that FKBP12.6 is not involved in the inhibitory action of K201 on spontaneous Ca2+ release. Our results also suggest that suppression of spontaneous Ca2+ release and the activity of RyR2 contributes, at least in part, to the anti-arrhythmic properties of K201.

A new 1,4-benzothiazepine derivative, JTV519, has a strong protective effect against Ca(2+) overload-induced myocardial injury. We investigated the effect of JTV519 on ischemia/reperfusion injury in isolated rat hearts. At 30 minutes of reperfusion after 30-minute global ischemia, the percent recovery of left ventricular developed pressure was improved, and the creatine phosphokinase and lactate dehydrogenase leakage was reduced in a concentration-dependent manner when JTV519 was administered in the coronary perfusate both at 5 minutes before the induction of ischemia and at the time of reperfusion. The myocardial protective effect of JTV519 was completely blocked by pretreatment of the heart with GF109203X, a specific protein kinase C (PKC) inhibitor. In contrast, the effect of JTV519 was not affected by alpha(1)-, A(1)-, and B(2)-receptor blockers that couple with PKC in the cardiomyocyte. Both immunofluorescence images and immunoblots of JTV519-treated left ventricular myocardium and isolated ventricular myocytes demonstrated that this agent induced concentration-dependent translocation of the delta-isoform but not the other isoforms of PKC to the plasma membrane. The mechanism of cardioprotection by JTV519 against ischemia/reperfusion injury involves isozyme-specific PKC activation through a receptor-independent mechanism. This agent may provide a novel pharmacological approach for the treatment of patients with acute coronary diseases via a subcellular mechanism mimicking ischemic preconditioning.

JTV519 is know to protect cardiomyocytes from calcium overloading-induced damage. The aim of this study was to investigate the potential protective effect of JTV519 on myocardium subjected to prolonged ischemia and the underlying mechanism of such protection. The effect of JTV519 was also compared with that of diltiazem, a 1,5-benzothiazepine derivative. Isolated rat hearts were randomly divided into three groups. Control hearts were arrested with histidine-tryptophan-ketoglutarat (HTK) cardioplegic solution alone. In the JTV519 group of hearts, cardiac arrest was achieved with JTV519 (10(-3) mmol/L) in the HTK solution. Hearts in the diltiazem group were arrested with diltiazem (0.5 mmol/L) in the HTK solution. All the hearts were then subjected to 6-hour storage in HTK solution at 4 degrees C. After a 30-minute reperfusion, the left ventricular developed pressure in the JTV519 and diltiazem groups were improved significantly compared with the control group. There was a significantly lower left ventricular end-diastolic pressure level and higher recovery of coronary flow in the JTV519 group than in the control group. The postischemic intracellular calcium concentration was attenuated by adding JTV519 or diltiazem to HTK cardioplegia. As an adjunct to cardioplegia, JTV519 showed a significant protective effect on myocardium undergoing 6 hours of ischemia. The beneficial protective effects of JTV519 are correlated with its ability to inhibit the postischemic rise in intracellular calcium.

Defective interaction between FKBP12.6 and ryanodine receptors (RyR) is a possible cause of cardiac dysfunction in heart failure (HF). Here, we assess whether the new cardioprotective agent JTV519 can correct it in tachycardia-induced HF. HF was induced in dogs by 4-wk rapid ventricular pacing, and sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR) was isolated from left ventricular muscles. In failing SR, JTV519 increased the rate of Ca(2+) release and [(3)H]ryanodine binding. RyR were then labeled in a site-directed fashion with the fluorescent conformational probe methylcoumarin acetamide. In failing SR, the polylysine induced a rapid change in methylcoumarin acetamide fluorescence, presumably because the channel opening preceding the Ca(2+) release was smaller than in normal SR (consistent with a decreased rate of Ca(2+) release in failing SR), and JTV519 increased it. In conclusion, JTV519, a new 1,4-benzothiazepine derivative, corrected the defective channel gating in RyR (increase in both the rapid conformational change and the subsequent Ca(2+) release rate) in HF.

Activation of the skeletal muscle ryanodine receptor (RyR1) complex results in the rapid release of Ca(2+) from the sarcoplasmic reticulum and muscle contraction. Dissociation of the small FK506 binding protein 12 subunit (FKBP12) increases RyR1 activity and impairs muscle function. The 1,4-benzothiazepine derivative JTV519, and the more specific derivative S107 (2,3,4,5,-tetrahydro-7-methoxy-4-methyl-1,4-benzothiazepine), are thought to improve skeletal muscle function by stabilizing the RyR1-FKBP12 complex. Here, we report a high degree of nonspecific and specific low affinity [(3)H]S107 binding to SR vesicles. SR vesicles enriched in RyR1 bound ∼48 [(3)H]S107 per RyR1 tetramer with EC(50) ∼52 µM and Hillslope ∼2. The effects of S107 and FKBP12 on RyR1 were examined under conditions that altered the redox state of RyR1. S107 increased FKBP12 binding to RyR1 in SR vesicles in the presence of reduced glutathione and the NO-donor NOC12, with no effect in the presence of oxidized glutathione. Addition of 0.15 µM FKBP12 to SR vesicles prevented FKBP12 dissociation; however, in the presence of oxidized glutathione and NOC12, FKBP12 dissociation was observed in skeletal muscle homogenates that contained 0.43 µM myoplasmic FKBP12 and was attenuated by S107. In single channel measurements with FKBP12-depleted RyR1s, in the absence and presence of NOC12, S107 augmented the FKBP12-mediated decrease in channel activity. The data suggest that S107 can reverse the harmful effects of redox active species on SR Ca(2+) release in skeletal muscle by binding to RyR1 low affinity sites.

K201 (JTV519) is a 1,4-benzothiazepine derivative that exhibits a strong cardioprotective action and acts as a multiple-channel blocker, including as a K+ channel blocker. An experimental model of prolongation of the QT interval and torsades de pointes can be induced in rabbits by treatment with clofilium in the presence of the alpha1-adrenoreceptor agonist methoxamine. In this study we examined the effects of K201 with and without methoxamine on the QT and QTc intervals, and determined whether K201 inhibits clofilium-induced torsades de pointes in the presence of methoxamine (15 microg/kg/min) in rabbits (n=74). Administration of K201 (0, 40, 100, 200 and 400 microg/kg/min) with and without methoxamine prolonged the QT interval in a dose-dependent manner, and torsades de pointes did not occur in any animals. However, clofilium (50 microg/kg/min) with methoxamine induced torsades de pointes in all animals (6/6). Torsades de pointes occurred at rates of 100%, 67%, 40% and 0% at K201 concentrations of 0, 50, 200 and 400 microg/kg/min, respectively, in the clofilium-infused torsades de pointes model. Therefore, 400 microg/kg/min of K201 completely inhibited clofilium-induced torsades de pointes and attenuated the increase of repolarization caused by clofilium; the inhibitory effects of K201 may be related to its pharmacological properties as an alpha1-adrenoceptor blocker. Overall, our results show that K201 causes prolongation of the QT and QTc intervals, but does not induce torsades de pointes, with and without alpha1-adrenoceptor stimulation. Furthermore, K201 inhibits clofilium-induced torsades de pointes, despite QT prolongation, suggesting that QT prolongation alone is not a proarrhythmic signal.

Ventricular arrhythmias can cause sudden cardiac death (SCD) in patients with normal hearts and in those with underlying disease such as heart failure. In animals with heart failure and in patients with inherited forms of exercise-induced SCD, depletion of the channel-stabilizing protein calstabin2 (FKBP12.6) from the ryanodine receptor-calcium release channel (RyR2) complex causes an intracellular Ca2+ leak that can trigger fatal cardiac arrhythmias. A derivative of 1,4-benzothiazepine (JTV519) increased the affinity of calstabin2 for RyR2, which stabilized the closed state of RyR2 and prevented the Ca2+ leak that triggers arrhythmias. Thus, enhancing the binding of calstabin2 to RyR2 may be a therapeutic strategy for common ventricular arrhythmias.

Ca²⁺ leak from the sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR) via ryanodine receptors (RyR2s) contributes to cardiomyocyte dysfunction. RyR2 Ca²⁺ leak has been related to RyR2 phosphorylation. In these conditions, JTV519 (K201), a 1,4-benzothiazepine derivative and multi-channel blocker, stabilizes RyR2s and decrease SR Ca²⁺ leak. We investigated whether JTV519 stabilizes RyR2s without increasing RyR2 phosphorylation in mice and in non-failing human myocardium and explored underlying mechanisms. SR Ca²⁺ leak was induced by ouabain in murine cardiomyocytes. [Ca²⁺]-transients, SR Ca²⁺ load and RyR2-mediated Ca²⁺ leak (sparks/waves) were quantified, with or without JTV519 (1 µmol·L⁻¹). Contribution of Ca²⁺ -/calmodulin-dependent kinase II (CaMKII) was assessed by KN-93 and Western blot (RyR2-Ser(2814) phosphorylation). Effects of JTV519 on contractile force were investigated in non-failing human ventricular trabeculae. Ouabain increased systolic and diastolic cytosolic [Ca²⁺](i) , SR [Ca²⁺], and SR Ca²⁺ leak (Ca²⁺ spark (SparkF) and Ca²⁺ wave frequency), independently of CaMKII and RyR-Ser(2814) phosphorylation. JTV519 decreased SparkF but also SR Ca²⁺ load. At matched SR [Ca²⁺], Ca²⁺ leak was significantly reduced by JTV519, but it had no effect on fractional Ca²⁺ release or Ca²⁺ wave propagation velocity. In human muscle, JTV519 was negatively inotropic at baseline but significantly enhanced ouabain-induced force and reduced its deleterious effects on diastolic function. JTV519 was effective in reducing SR Ca²⁺ leak by specifically regulating RyR2 opening at diastolic [Ca²⁺](i) in the absence of increased RyR2 phosphorylation at Ser(2814) , extending the potential use of JTV519 to conditions of acute cellular Ca²⁺ overload.

A newly synthesized 1,4-benzothiazipine derivate, 4-[3-(4-benzylpiperidin-1-yl) propionyl]-7-methoxy-2,3,4,5-tetrahydro-1, 4-benzothiazepine monohydrochloride (JTV-519) was examined for its ability to reverse P-glycoprotein (P-gp) and multidrug resistance protein 1 (MRP1) mediated multidrug resistance (MDR) in K562/MDR and KB/MRP cells, respectively. JTV-519 at 3 microM reversed the resistance of K562/MDR cells to vincristine (VCR), taxol, etoposide (VP16), adriamycin (ADM) and actinomycin D and at 0.5 or 1 microM reversed their resistance to STI571. JTV-519 at 10 microM enhanced the accumulation of ADM in K562/MDR cells to the level in parental K562 cells and inhibited the efflux of ADM from K562/MDR cells. Photoaffinity labeling of P-gp with 3H-azidopine was almost completely inhibited by 500 microM JTV-519. JTV-519 at 3 microM also partially reversed the resistance of KB/MRP cells to VCR and at 500 microM partially inhibited the photoaffinity labeling of MRP1 with (125)I-II-azidophenyl agosterol A (125I-azidoAG-A). These results suggest that JTV-519 reversed the resistance to the anti-cancer agents in P-gp and MRP1 overexpressing multidrug-resistant cells by directly binding to P-gp and MRP1, and competitively inhibiting transport of the anti-cancer agents.

The development of heart failure is tightly correlated with a decrease in the stoichiometric ratio for FKBP12.6 binding to the ryanodine receptor (RyR) in the sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR). We report that a new drug, the 1,4-benzothiazepine derivative JTV519, reverses this pathogenic process. JTV519 is known to have a protective effect against Ca2+ overload-induced myocardial injury. Heart failure was produced by 4 weeks of rapid right ventricular pacing, with or without JTV519; SR were then isolated from dog left ventricular (LV) muscles. First, in JTV519-treated dogs, no signs of heart failure were observed after 4 weeks of chronic right ventricular pacing, LV systolic and diastolic functions were largely preserved, and LV remodeling was prevented. Second, JTV519 acutely inhibited both the FK506-induced Ca2+ leak from RyR in normal SR and the spontaneous Ca2+ leak in failing SR. Third, there was no abnormal Ca2+ leak in SR vesicles isolated from JTV519-treated hearts. Fourth, in JTV519-treated hearts, both the stoichiometry of FKBP12.6 binding to RyR and the amount of RyR-bound FKBP12.6 were restored toward the values seen in normal SR. Fifth, in JTV519-untreated hearts, RyR was PKA-hyperphosphorylated, whereas it was reversed in JTV519-treated hearts, returning the channel phosphorylation toward the levels seen in normal hearts. During the development of experimental heart failure, JTV519 prevented the amount of RyR-bound FKBP12.6 from decreasing. This in turn reduced the abnormal Ca2+ leak through the RyR, prevented LV remodeling, and led to less severe heart failure.

A newly synthesized benzothiazepine derivative, JTV-519 (JT) has been reported to be cardioprotective. However, the precise mechanism underlying the cardioprotective effect of this drug is unknown. Coronary-perfused guinea-pig ventricular muscles were subjected to 20-min no-flow ischaemia followed by 60-min reperfusion (I/R). I/R significantly decreased the contraction in untreated preparations (control group, 34+/-4% of baseline value, n=6). Brief administration of JT (1.0 microM) prior to ischaemia significantly improved the postischaemic contractile recovery (63+/-5% of baseline value, n=4), as compared to the control group. JT (1.0 microM) slightly prolonged action potential duration before ischaemia and induced conduction disturbance (2 : 1 block) after the initiation of ischaemia. The cardioprotective effect of JT was antagonized by chelerythrine (CH, 5.0 microM), an inhibitor of protein kinase C (PKC) or by 5-hydroxydecanoic acid (5-HD, 400 microM), an inhibitor of mitochondrial ATP-sensitive K(+) (K(ATP)) channels. These results suggest that the protective effect of JT is due to the opening of mitochondrial K(ATP) channels, which, in turn, is linked to PKC activation.

A new 1,4-benzothiazepine derivative, JTV519 (JTV), has strong protective effects against isoproterenol-induced myocardial injury. We investigated the effects of JTV on Ca2+ overload and on functional recovery during ischemia/reperfusion in isolated coronary-perfused rat hearts. After 30 minutes of reperfusion following 30 min of global ischemia, the % recovery of LV developed pressure was improved in a concentration-dependent manner when JTV (0.3-3.0 microM) was administered either 5 min before induction of ischemia or for 5 min at the time of reperfusion only JTV showed a negative inotropic effect only at concentrations above 3.0 microM. In indol-loaded isolated heart preparations, 0.3 microM JTV did not affect the preischemic systolic or diastolic Ca2+ levels of the Ca2+ transient as measured by the ratio of 2-wavelength fluormetry (R405/500). In contrast, it significantly reduced the increase in the ratio in the postischemic reperfusion period (% change of R405/500 from baseline: JTV(-), by 42.7 +/- 3.2%; JTV(+), by 18.4 +/- 9.1%, p < 0.05). In isolated rat ventricular myocytes with a standard patch-clamp method, we further tested the interaction of JTV with the L-type Ca2+ channel (I(Ca)). The % inhibition of the peak current of I(Ca) was 6.2 +/- 0.8% at 0.3 microM (p = n.s.), 22.0 +/- 3.3% at 1.0 microM (p < 0.05), and 59.6 +/- 1.4% at 3.0 microM (p < 0.01). Thus, the marked cardioprotection due to JTV at 0.3 microM may not be solely attributed to its inhibitory effect on the transsarcolemmal Ca2+ influx through I(Ca). In conclusion, JTV519 is a novel pharmacological agent that has been demonstrated for the first time to have clinical potential for the treatment of acute coronary syndrome by its efficacy in administration at the time of reperfusion, by its suppression of reperfusion-related intracellular Ca2+ overload with no significant interaction with I(Ca), and by its subsequent ability of strong myocardial protection.
