What is the function of the protein Cuf1?

Copper is an essential nutrient that serves as a co-factor for enzymes involved in critical cellular processes including energy generation, peptide hormone maturation, oxidative stress protection, and iron homeostasis. Although genes have been identified from yeast and mammals encoding a homologous subunit of a plasma membrane high affinity copper transporter, the presence of additional subunits that function as part of a copper transport complex has not been reported. We observed that ctr4(+), a previously identified copper transport protein from the fission yeast Schizosaccharomyces pombe, fails to complement bakers' yeast cells defective in high affinity copper transport and fails to be targeted to the plasma membrane. However, selection for S. pombe genes, which, when co-expressed with Ctr4, confer high affinity copper transport to S. cerevisiae cells resulted in the identification of ctr5(+). Both Ctr4 and Ctr5 are integral membrane proteins, are co-regulated by copper levels and the copper-sensing transcription factor Cuf1, physically associate in vivo, are interdependent for secretion to the plasma membrane, and are each essential for high affinity copper transport. These studies in S. pombe identify Ctr4 and Ctr5 as components of a novel eukaryotic heteromeric plasma membrane complex that is essential for high affinity copper transport.

Here, we present further characterization of cryptococcal CUF1 in copper homeostasis. We demonstrated that CUF1 was involved both in copper acquisition and in copper detoxification in response to copper variation. This was verified by direct measurement of the quantity of intracellular copper with flame atomic absorption spectrometry (FAAS) and molecular evidence. In copper-limited growth, the mutant cuf1Δ exhibited copper deficiency, growth defect on glycerol and sensitivity to hydrogen peroxide and methionine. A novel function of cryptococcal CUF1 is revealed in copper detoxification when copper is in excess. The mutant cuf1Δ showed severe hypersensitivity to exogenous copper, while a high level of copper was accumulated shown by FAAS, suggesting that CUF1 may be required in copper export events. On cloning of cDNA, it was found that Cuf1 distinguishably harbors functional elements that are found in Ace1 and Mac1 of Saccharomyces cerevisiae. The regulation of copper homeostasis by Cuf1 is realized by its subcellular localization. Epifluorescence microscopy observed that, upon copper depletion, Cuf1 was localized exclusively to the nucleus as an activator for CTR4 transcription, while it was located to the cell periphery in the presence of exogenous copper. This work reveals a unique copper regulator and may provide insights into the copper metabolism in fungi.

Copper amine oxidases (CAOs) have been proposed to be involved in the metabolism of xenobiotic and biogenic amines. The requirement for copper is absolute for their activity. In the fission yeast Schizosaccharomyces pombe, cao1(+) and cao2(+) genes are predicted to encode members of the CAO family. While both genes are expressed in wild-type cells, we determined that the expression of only cao1(+) but not cao2(+) results in the production of an active enzyme. Site-directed mutagenesis identified three histidine residues within the C-terminal region of Cao1 that are necessary for amine oxidase activity. By use of a cao1(+)-GFP allele that retained wild-type function, Cao1-GFP was localized in the cytosol (GFP is green fluorescent protein). Under copper-limiting conditions, disruption of ctr4(+), ctr5(+), and cuf1(+) produced a defect in amine oxidase activity, indicating that a functionally active Cao1 requires Ctr4/5-mediated copper transport and the transcription factor Cuf1. Likewise, atx1 null cells exhibited substantially decreased levels of amine oxidase activity. In contrast, deletion of ccc2, cox17, and pccs had no significant effect on Cao1 activity. Residual amine oxidase activity in cells lacking atx1(+) can be restored to normal levels by returning an atx1(+) allele, underscoring the critical importance of the presence of Atx1 in cells. Using two-hybrid analysis, we demonstrated that Cao1 physically interacts with Atx1 and that this association is comparable to that of Atx1 with the N-terminal region of Ccc2. Collectively, these results describe the first example of the ability of Atx1 to act as a copper carrier for a molecule other than Ccc2 and its critical role in delivering copper to Cao1.

In this study, we examine the fate of the nuclear pool of the Schizosaccharomyces pombe transcription factor Cuf1 in response to variations in copper levels. A nuclear pool of Cuf1-green fluorescent protein (GFP) was generated by expressing a functional cuf1(+)-GFP allele in the presence of a copper chelator. We then extinguished cuf1(+)-GFP expression and tracked the changes in the localization of the nuclear pool of Cuf1-GFP in the presence of low or high copper concentrations. Treating cells with copper as well as silver ions resulted in the nuclear export of Cuf1. We identified a leucine-rich nuclear export signal (NES), (349)LAALNHISAL(358), within the C-terminal region of Cuf1. Mutations in this sequence abrogated Cuf1 export from the nucleus. Furthermore, amino acid substitutions that impair Cuf1 NES function resulted in increased target gene expression and a concomitant cellular hypersensitivity to copper. Export of the wild-type Cuf1 protein was inhibited by leptomycin B (LMB), a specific inhibitor of the nuclear export protein Crm1. We further show that cells expressing a temperature-sensitive mutation in crm1(+) exhibit increased nuclear accumulation of Cuf1 at the nonpermissive temperature. Although wild-type Cuf1 is localized in the nucleus in both conditions, we observed that the protein can still be inactivated by copper, resulting in the repression of ctr4(+) gene expression in the presence of exogenous copper. These results demonstrate that nuclear accumulation of Cuf1 per se is not sufficient to cause the unregulated expression of the copper transport genes like ctr4(+). In addition to nuclear localization, a functional Cys-rich domain or NES element in Cuf1 is required to appropriately regulate copper transport gene expression in response to changes in intracellular copper concentration.

Aerobic organisms possess efficient systems for the transport of copper. This involves transporters that mediate the passage of copper across biological membranes to reach essential intracellular copper-requiring enzymes. In this report, we identify a new copper transporter in Schizosaccharomyces pombe, encoded by the ctr6(+) gene. The transcription of ctr6(+) is induced under copper-limiting conditions. This regulation is mediated by the cis-acting promoter element CuSE (copper-signaling element) through the copper-sensing transcription factor Cuf1. An S. pombe strain bearing a disrupted ctr6Delta allele displays a strong reduction of copper,zinc superoxide dismutase activity. When the ctr6+ gene is overexpressed from the thiamine-inducible nmt1(+) promoter, the cells are unable to grow on medium containing exogenous copper. Surprisingly, this copper-sensitive growth phenotype is not due to an increase of copper uptake at the cell surface. Instead, copper delivery across the plasma membrane is reduced. Consistently, this results in repressing ctr4(+) gene expression. By using a functional ctr6(+) epitope-tagged allele expressed under the control of its own promoter, we localize the Ctr6 protein on the membrane of vacuoles. Furthermore, we demonstrate that Ctr6 is an integral membrane protein that can trimerize. Moreover, we show that Ctr6 harbors a putative copper-binding Met-X-His-Cys-X-Met-X-Met motif in the amino terminus, which is essential for its function. Our findings suggest that under conditions in which copper is scarce, Ctr6 is required as a means to mobilize stored copper from the vacuole to the cytosol.
