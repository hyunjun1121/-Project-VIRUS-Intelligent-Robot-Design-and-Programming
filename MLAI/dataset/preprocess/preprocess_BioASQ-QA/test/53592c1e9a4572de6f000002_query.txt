[PMID: 18461550]
To derive a model and examine the performance of first-trimester combined screening by maternal age, fetal nuchal translucency (NT) thickness and maternal serum free beta-human chorionic gonadotropin (beta-hCG) and pregnancy-associated plasma protein-A (PAPP-A). Prospective combined screening for trisomy 21 was carried out at 11 + 0 to 13 + 6 weeks in 56,771 singleton pregnancies, including 56,376 cases with a normal karyotype or delivery of a phenotypically normal baby (unaffected group) and 395 cases with trisomy 21. The blood test and ultrasound scan were carried out in the same visit. In each case the maternal age-related risk for trisomy 21 at term was calculated and adjusted according to the gestational age at the time of screening to derive the a-priori risk. The measured NT was transformed into a likelihood ratio using the mixture model of NT distributions. The measured free beta-hCG and PAPP-A were converted into a multiple of the median (MoM) for gestational age, adjusted for maternal weight, ethnicity, smoking status, method of conception and parity, and a likelihood ratio was subsequently calculated. The likelihood ratios for NT and for the biochemical markers were multiplied by the a-priori risk to derive the patient-specific risk. Detection rates and false-positive rates were calculated by taking the proportions with risks above a given risk threshold after adjustment for maternal age according to the distribution of pregnancies in England and Wales in 2000-2002. These standardized rates were compared with detection and false-positive rates estimated using Monte Carlo methods to sample from the modeled Gaussian distributions. The performance of screening based on the model was in good agreement with that observed in our population. In a strategy for first-trimester combined screening where the blood test and scan are carried out in the same visit it was estimated that, for false-positive rates of 3% and 5%, the detection rates were 92% and 94%, respectively, at 11 weeks, 85% and 90% at 12 weeks, and 79% and 83% at 13 weeks. In an alternative strategy, with the blood taken at 10 weeks and the measurement of NT performed at 12 weeks, the estimated detection rates were 94% and 96% for false-positive rates of 3% and 5%, respectively. The aim of the first-trimester scan is not just to screen for trisomy 21 but also to diagnose an increasing number of fetal malformations. In this respect the ability to visualize fetal anatomy is better at 12-13 weeks than at 11 weeks. Consequently, the ideal gestation for combined testing in the same visit would be 12 weeks. An alternative strategy, with the blood taken at 10 weeks and the measurement of NT performed at 12 weeks, is associated with higher detection rates of trisomy 21. However, the cost of two-stage screening would be higher and, in addition, the potential advantage in terms of detection rate may be eroded by the likely increased non-compliance with the additional step.

To determine if nuchal translucency (NT) can be used as a first trimester triage marker in prenatal screening for Down syndrome and trisomy 18. Data from first trimester prenatal screening in 77 443 women were stratified by maternal and gestational ages. They were then analyzed to identify NT thresholds above or below which only positive (high-risk) or negative (low-risk) results were reported by a first trimester prenatal screening test combining PAPP-A, free beta-hCG and NT. Combined prenatal screening was always positive for Down syndrome when NT thickness exceeded 4.0 mm. As women aged, this upper NT threshold value changed according to gestational age. In women aged 35 to 37 years, combined prenatal screening was always positive when NT exceeded 2.8 mm, 3.0 mm, and 3.4 mm at 11, 12, and 13 weeks of gestation, respectively. In women over 42 years of age, the upper threshold value for NT was 1.8 mm, 2.4 mm, and 2.7 mm at 11, 12, and 13 weeks of gestation, respectively. In women less than 35 years of age, we identified lower threshold values below which combined prenatal screening for Down syndrome was always negative. In prenatal screening for Down syndrome and trisomy 18, it is possible to identify NT threshold values above which biochemical screening provides no additional benefit. In pregnancies in which NT is above the established upper cut-offs, invasive prenatal screening can be offered without delay.

The purpose of this study is to assess the feasibility of foetal nasal bone (NB) measurement during the first trimester of pregnancy, and to examine the contribution of this measurement to the prenatal screening for Down syndrome following the definition of NB threshold using ROC curves in an unselected population. This prospective study was carried out at our centre SIHCUS-CMCO (reference centre) from January 2002 to December 2004 on a total of 2,044 pregnant outpatients at gestational weeks 11-14. Only 1260 singleton foetuses were used for statistical analysis. In the 784 other patients, we were unable to obtain a correct image allowing a reproducible measurement. NB was measured during the same session as nuchal translucency (NT) measurement. Ten trained sonographers took part in the study. Correlation index was evaluated to shed light on a link between interest variables and NB. Screening values of NB measurement in T 21 were also calculated with NB measurement according to crown-rump length, and expressed as the best threshold of multiple of the median determined by ROC curve. Screening values of genetic ultrasound were then evaluated by adding NB measurement to maternal age and NT measurement. Two thousand and forty-four patients were included. We indexed 30 cases of T 21, 14 cases of Trisomy 18, 10 cases of Trisomy 13 and 25 cases of other karyotype abnormalities. Feasibility of measurement was 62% of all cases. We observed a significant relation between NB and NT (p = 0.001 ), as well as between NB and crown-rump-length (p < 0.0001 ). However, size of NB was not correlated to maternal ethnic group (p = 0.314). At 0.6 multiple of the median thresholds, screening values of NB measurement in T 21 were: sensibility 32%, false positive rate 10%, positive predictive value 13.6%, and negative predictive value 96.9%. The likelihood ratio for T 21 in case of NB < or = 0.6 multiple of the median was 4.4 (2.0-9.4). Screening values for maternal age and NT measurement were: sensitivity 88%, false positive rate 23%,positive predictive value 9.7%, and negative predictive value 99.6%. Inclusion of NB measurement increased sensitivity to 100%, positive predictive value to 13.6%, and negative predictive value to 100%, and decreased false positive rate to 5%. NB measurement seemed to be a great sonographic marker for T 21. However, its low feasibility made it inadequate for routine settings in first trimester T 21 screening in an unselected population. Statistical independence with NT thickness needed to be further evaluated.

To derive a model and examine the performance of first-trimester screening for trisomy 18 by maternal age, fetal nuchal translucency (NT) thickness, and maternal serum free beta-human chorionic gonadotropin (beta-hCG) and pregnancy-associated plasma protein-A (PAPP-A). Prospective combined screening for trisomy 21 was performed at 11 + 0 to 13 + 6 weeks in 56 893 singleton pregnancies, including 56 376 cases of euploid fetuses, 395 with trisomy 21 and 122 with trisomy 18. The measured free beta-hCG and PAPP-A were converted into a multiple of the median (MoM) and then into likelihood ratios (LR). Similarly, the measured NT was transformed into LRs using the mixture model of NT distributions. In each case the LRs for NT and the biochemical markers were multiplied by the age and gestation-related risk to derive the risk for trisomy 21 and trisomy 18. Detection rates (DRs) and false-positive rates (FPRs) were calculated by taking the proportions with risks above a given risk threshold. In screening with the algorithm for trisomy 21, at a FPR of 3%, the estimated DRs of trisomies 21 and 18 were 89% and 82%, respectively. The use of an algorithm for trisomy 18 identified 93% of affected fetuses at a FPR of 0.2%. When the algorithm for trisomy 21 was used and screen positivity was fixed at a FPR of 3%, and in addition the algorithm for trisomy 18 was used and screen positivity was fixed at a FPR of 0.2%, the overall FPR was 3.1% and the DRs of trisomies 21 and 18 were 90% and 97%, respectively. A beneficial side effect of first-trimester combined screening for trisomy 21 is the detection of a high proportion of fetuses with trisomy 18. If an algorithm for trisomy 18 in addition to the one for trisomy 21 is used, more than 95% of trisomy 18 fetuses can be detected with a minor increase of 0.1% in the overall FPR.

The purpose of the present literature review is to assess the screening value of trisomy 21 by measurement of fetal nuchal translucency (NT) thickness in the first trimester. NT is a subcutaneous translucency between the skin and the soft tissues overlying the cervical spine, which disappears in the second trimester. Ultrasound examination was used to image a sagittal section of the fetus to measure the maximum thickness of the subcutaneous translucency. NT is physiological for a measurement < 3 mm but the incidence of chromosomal abnormalities (essentially trisomies 21, 18 and 13) increases when NT > or = 3 mm. Differential diagnoses include cystic hygroma and fetal hydrops. For screening purposes, a cut-off threshold value of > or = 3 mm, with a standardized technique, gave a sensitivity > or = 50%, a false positive rate < 5% and a positive predictive value > 1%. In the chromosomally normal group, prognosis was good, but incidence of structural defects and fetal loss increased, with a sharp rise in these complications for fetal translucency thickness > or = 5 mm.
