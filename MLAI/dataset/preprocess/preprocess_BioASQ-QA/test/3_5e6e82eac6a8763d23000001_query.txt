The diterpenoid ester ingenol mebutate (IngMeb) is the active ingredient in the topical drug Picato, a first-in-class treatment for the precancerous skin condition actinic keratosis. IngMeb is proposed to exert its therapeutic effects through a dual mode of action involving (i) induction of cell death that is associated with mitochondrial dysfunction followed by (ii) stimulation of a local inflammatory response, at least partially driven by protein kinase C (PKC) activation. Although this therapeutic model has been well characterized, the complete set of molecular targets responsible for mediating IngMeb activity remains ill-defined. Here, we have synthesized a photoreactive, clickable analogue of IngMeb and used this probe in quantitative proteomic experiments to map several protein targets of IngMeb in human cancer cell lines and primary human keratinocytes. Prominent among these targets was the mitochondrial carnitine-acylcarnitine translocase SLC25A20, which we show is inhibited in cells by IngMeb and the more stable analogue ingenol disoxate (IngDsx), but not by the canonical PKC agonist 12-<i>O</i>-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate (TPA). SLC25A20 blockade by IngMeb and IngDsx leads to a buildup of cellular acylcarnitines and blockade of fatty acid oxidation (FAO), pointing to a possible mechanism for IngMeb-mediated perturbations in mitochondrial function.

The carnitine/acylcarnitine transporter (CACT; SLC25A20) mediates an antiport reaction allowing entry of acyl moieties in the form of acylcarnitines into the mitochondrial matrix and exit of free carnitine. The transport function of CACT is crucial for the β-oxidation pathway. In this work, it has been found that CACT is partially acetylated in rat liver mitochondria as demonstrated by anti-acetyl-lys antibody immunostaining. Acetylation was reversed by the deacetylase Sirtuin 3 in the presence of NAD<sup>+</sup>. After treatment of the mitochondrial extract with the deacetylase, the CACT activity, assayed in proteoliposomes, increased. The half-saturation constant of the CACT was not influenced, while the V <sub>max</sub> was increased by deacetylation. Sirtuin 3 was not able to deacetylate the CACT when incubation was performed in intact mitoplasts, indicating that the acetylation sites are located in the mitochondrial matrix. Prediction on the localization of acetylated residues by bioinformatics correlates well with the experimental data. Recombinant CACT treated with acetyl-CoA was partially acetylated by non-enzymatic mechanism with a corresponding decrease of transport activity. The experimental data indicate that acetylation of CACT inhibits its transport activity, and thus may contribute to the regulation of the mitochondrial β-oxidation pathway.

Cardiac metabolism is highly adaptive in response to changes in substrate availability, as occur during fasting. This metabolic flexibility is essential to the maintenance of contractile function and is under the control of a group of select transcriptional regulators, notably the nuclear receptor family of factors member PPARα. However, the diversity of physiologic and pathologic states through which the heart must sustain function suggests the possible existence of additional transcriptional regulators that play a role in matching cardiac metabolism to energetic demand. Here we show that cardiac KLF15 is required for the normal cardiac response to fasting. Specifically, we find that cardiac function is impaired upon fasting in systemic and cardiac specific Klf15-null mice. Further, cardiac specific Klf15-null mice display a fasting-dependent accumulation of long chain acylcarnitine species along with a decrease in expression of the carnitine translocase Slc25a20. Treatment with a diet high in short chain fatty acids relieves the KLF15-dependent long chain acylcarnitine accumulation and impaired cardiac function in response to fasting. Our observations establish KLF15 as a critical mediator of the cardiac adaptive response to fasting through its regulation of myocardial lipid utilization.
