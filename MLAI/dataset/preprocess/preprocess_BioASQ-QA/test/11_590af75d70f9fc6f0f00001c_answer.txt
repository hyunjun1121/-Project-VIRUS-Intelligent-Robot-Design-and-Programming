IDEAL_ANSWER:
- The UCSC Genome Browser organizes data and annotations (called tracks) around the reference sequences or draft assemblies of many eukaryotic genomes and presents them using a powerful web-based graphical interface. The database is optimized to support fast interactive performance with the web-based UCSC Genome Browser, a tool built on top of the database for rapid visualization and querying of the data at many levels. The annotations for a given genome are displayed in the browser as a series of tracks aligned with the genomic sequence. Sequence data and annotations may also be viewed in a text-based tabular format or downloaded as tab-delimited flat files.
- The database tables underlying the Genome Browser tracks can be viewed, downloaded, and manipulated using another Web-based application, the UCSC Table Browser. The annotations for a given genome are displayed in the browser as a series of tracks aligned with the genomic sequence. Binary Alignment/Map , where the differences between the data set and the reference assembly may be displayed graphically. The Saved Session feature allows users to store and share customized views, enhancing the utility of the system for organizing multiple trains of thought. The University of California Santa Cruz  is a popular Web-based tool for quickly displaying a requested portion of a genome at any scale, accompanied by a series of aligned annotation "tracks".
