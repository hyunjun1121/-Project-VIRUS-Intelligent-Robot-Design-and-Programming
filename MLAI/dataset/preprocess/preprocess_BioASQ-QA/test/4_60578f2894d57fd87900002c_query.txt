Activation of Agouti-Related Peptide (AgRP)-expressing neurons promotes feeding and insulin resistance. Here, we examine the contribution of neuropeptide Y (NPY)-dependent signaling to the diverse physiological consequences of activating AgRP neurons. NPY-deficient mice fail to rapidly increase food intake during the first hour of either chemo- or optogenetic activation of AgRP neurons, while the delayed increase in feeding is comparable between control and NPY-deficient mice. Acutely stimulating AgRP neurons fails to induce systemic insulin resistance in NPY-deficient mice, while increased locomotor activity upon AgRP neuron stimulation in the absence of food remains unaffected in these animals. Selective re-expression of NPY in AgRP neurons attenuates the reduced feeding response and reverses the protection from insulin resistance upon optogenetic activation of AgRP neurons in NPY-deficient mice. Collectively, these experiments reveal a pivotal role of NPY-dependent signaling in mediating the rapid feeding inducing effect and the acute glucose regulatory function governed by AgRP neurons.

Arcuate nucleus agouti-related peptide (AgRP) neurons play a central role in feeding and are under complex regulation by both homeostatic hormonal and nutrient signals and hypothalamic neuronal pathways. Feeding may also be influenced by environmental cues, sensory inputs, and other behaviors, implying the involvement of higher brain regions. However, whether such pathways modulate feeding through direct synaptic control of AgRP neuron activity is unknown. Here, we show that nociceptin-expressing neurons in the anterior bed nuclei of the stria terminalis (aBNST) make direct GABAergic inputs onto AgRP neurons. We found that activation of these neurons inhibited AgRP neurons and feeding. The activity of these neurons increased upon food availability, and their ablation resulted in obesity. Furthermore, these neurons received afferent inputs from a range of upstream brain regions as well as hypothalamic nuclei. Therefore, aBNST GABAergic nociceptin neurons may act as a gateway to feeding behavior by connecting AgRP neurons to both homeostatic and nonhomeostatic neuronal inputs.

Energy metabolism and bone homeostasis share several neuronal regulatory pathways. Within the ventral hypothalamus (VHT), the orexigenic neurons co-express Agouti-related peptide (AgRP) and neuropeptide Y (NPY) and the anorexigenic neurons co-express, α-melanocyte stimulating hormone derived from proopiomelanocortin (POMC), and cocaine and amphetamine-regulated transcript (CART). These neurons regulate both processes, yet their relative contribution is unknown. Previously, using genetically targeted activator protein (AP1) alterations as a tool, we showed in adult mice that AgRP or POMC neurons are capable of inducing whole-body energy catabolism and bone accrual, with different effects on bone resorption. Here, we investigated whether co-residing neurons exert similar regulatory effects. We show that AP1 antagonists targeted to NPY-producing or CART-producing neurons in adult mice stimulate energy expenditure, reduce body weight gain and adiposity and promote trabecular bone formation and mass, yet again via different effects on bone resorption, as measured by serum level of carboxy-terminal collagen type I crosslinks (CTX). In addition, AP1 antagonists promote neurite expansion, increasing neurite number, length, and surface area in primary hypothalamic neuronal cultures. Overall, our data demonstrate that the orexigenic NPY and anorexigenic CART neurons both have the capacity to stimulate energy burning state and increase bone mass. © 2020 American Society for Bone and Mineral Research.

Hypothalamic AMPK plays a major role in the regulation of whole body metabolism and energy balance. Present evidence has demonstrated that this canonical mechanism is evolutionarily conserved. Thus, recent data demonstrated that inhibition of AMPKα2 in fish hypothalamus led to decreased food intake and liver capacity to use and synthesize glucose, lipids, and amino acids. We hypothesize that a signal of abundance of nutrients from the hypothalamus controls hepatic metabolism. The vagus nerve is the most important link between the brain and the liver. We therefore examined in the present study whether surgical transection of the vagus nerve in rainbow trout is sufficient to alter the effect in liver of central inhibition of AMPKα2. Thus, we vagotomized (VGX) or not (Sham) rainbow trout and then intracerebroventricularly administered adenoviral vectors tagged with green fluorescent protein alone or linked to a dominant negative isoform of AMPKα2. The inhibition of AMPKα2 led to reduced food intake in parallel with changes in the mRNA abundance of hypothalamic neuropeptides [neuropeptide Y (<i>npy</i>), agouti-related protein 1 (<i>agrp1</i>), and cocaine- and amphetamine-related transcript (<i>cartpt</i>)] involved in food intake regulation. Central inhibition of AMPKα2 resulted in the liver having decreased capacity to use and synthesize glucose, lipids, and amino acids. Notably, these effects mostly disappeared in VGX fish. These results support the idea that autonomic nervous system actions mediate the actions of hypothalamic AMPKα2 on liver metabolism. Importantly, this evidence indicates that the well-established role of hypothalamic AMPK in energy balance is a canonical evolutionarily preserved mechanism that is also present in the fish lineage.
