Human noroviruses are a major cause of acute gastroenteritis worldwide, but the lack of a robust cell culture system or small animal model have hampered a better understanding of innate immunity against these viruses. Tulane virus (TV) is the prototype virus of a tentative new genus, Recovirus, in the family Caliciviridae. Its epidemiology and biological properties most closely resemble human norovirus. The host innate immune response to RNA virus infection primarily involves pathogen-sensing toll-like receptors (TLRs) TLR3 and TLR7 and retinoic acid-inducible gene I-like receptor RIG-I and melanoma differentiation associated gene 5 (MDA5). In this study, by using siRNA knockdown, we report that TV infection in LLC-MK2 cells results in an early [3 h post infection (h p.i.), P<0.05] RIG-I-dependent and type I interferon-mediated antiviral response, whereas an MDA5-mediated antiviral effect was observed at later (12 h p.i.; P<0.05) stages of TV replication. Induction of RIG-I and MDA5 was critical for inhibition of TV replication. Furthermore, pre-activation of the RIG-I/MDA5 pathway prevented TV replication (>900-fold decrease; P<0.05), suggesting that RIG-I and MDA5 ligands could be used to develop novel preventive and therapeutic measures against norovirus.

Retinoic acid-inducible gene-I (RIG-I)-like receptors (RLRs), including melanoma differentiation-associated gene 5 (MDA5) and RIG-I, are crucial for host recognition of non-self RNAs, especially viral RNA. Thus, the expression and activation of RLRs play fundamental roles in eliminating the invading RNA viruses and maintaining immune homeostasis. However, how RLR expression is tightly regulated remains to be further investigated. In this study, we identified a major histocompatibility complex (MHC)-encoded gene, tripartite interaction motif 40 (TRIM40), as a suppressor of RLR signaling by directly targeting MDA5 and RIG-I. TRIM40 binds to MDA5 and RIG-I and promotes their K27- and K48-linked polyubiquitination via its E3 ligase activity, leading to their proteasomal degradation. TRIM40 deficiency enhances RLR-triggered signaling. Consequently, TRIM40 deficiency greatly enhances antiviral immune responses and decreases viral replication in vivo. Thus, we demonstrate that TRIM40 limits RLR-triggered innate activation, suggesting TRIM40 as a potential therapeutic target for the control of viral infection.

Sensing of viral RNA by the cytosolic receptors RIG-I and melanoma differentiation-associated gene 5 (MDA5) leads to innate antiviral response. How RIG-I and MDA5 are dynamically regulated in innate antiviral response is not well understood. Here, we show that TRIM38 positively regulates MDA5- and RIG-I-mediated induction of downstream genes and acts as a SUMO E3 ligase for their dynamic sumoylation at K43/K865 and K96/K888, respectively, before and after viral infection. The sumoylation of MDA5 and RIG-I suppresses their K48-linked polyubiquitination and degradation in uninfected or early-infected cells. Sumoylation of the caspase recruitment domains of MDA5 and RIG-I is also required for their dephosphorylation by PP1 and activation upon viral infection. At the late phase of viral infection, both MDA5 and RIG-I are desumoylated by SENP2, resulting in their K48-linked polyubiquitination and degradation. These findings suggest that dynamic sumoylation and desumoylation of MDA5 and RIG-I modulate efficient innate immunity to RNA virus and its timely termination.

Melanoma differentiation-associated gene 5 (MDA5) is a pattern recognition receptor that recognizes cytoplasmic viral double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) and initiates rapid innate antiviral responses. MDA5 forms a filament-like multimer along the dsRNA leading to oligomerization, which in turn activates the adaptor protein mitochondrial antiviral signaling protein (MAVS) to provide a signal platform for the induction of type I interferon (IFN) and proinflammatory cytokines. The conformational switch of MDA5 causes antiviral defense, but excessive activation of the MDA5-MAVS pathway may result in autoimmune diseases. The regulatory mechanisms of MDA5 activation remain largely unknown. By yeast 2-hybrid, we identified DNAJB1, a member of the HSP40 (heat shock protein 40) family, as an MDA5-binding protein. HSP40s usually cowork with HSP70s. We found that dsRNA stimulation with physiological conditions upregulated the expression levels of DNAJB1 and HSP70; then the proteins were coupled and translocated into the stress granules, where MDA5 encounters dsRNA. DNAJB1 disrupted MDA5 multimer formation, resulting in the suppression of type I IFN induction. The disruption of endogenous DNAJB1 increased MDA5- and MAVS-mediated IFN promoter activation and rendered cells virus resistant. HSP70 inhibitor also enhanced the IFN-inducing function of MDA5 and MAVS. These results suggest that the DNAJB1-HSP70 complex functions for the natural maintenance of RNA sensing by interacting with MDA5/MAVS.

The innate immune system plays a critical role in pathogen recognition and initiation of protective immune response through the recognition of pathogen associated molecular patterns (PAMPs) by its pattern recognition receptors (PRRs). Nucleic acids including RNA and DNA have been recognized as very important PAMPs of pathogens especially for viruses. RNA are the major PAMPs of RNA viruses, to which most severe disease causing viruses belong thus posing a tougher challenge to human and animal health. Therefore, the understanding of the immune biology of RNA PRRs is critical for control of pathogen infections especially for RNA virus infections. RNA PRRs are comprised of TLR3, TLR7, TLR8, RIG-I, MDA5, NLRP3, NOD2, and some other minorities. This review introduces these RNA PRRs by describing the cellular localizations, ligand recognitions, activation mechanisms, cell signaling pathways, and recognition of pathogens; the cross-talks between various RNA PRRs are also reviewed. The deep insights of these RNA PRRs can be utilized to improve anti-viral immune response. © 2017 IUBMB Life, 69(5):297-304, 2017.
