What is the results of mutations in the gene autoimmune regulator?

[PMID: 29427825]
The autoimmune regulator gene (AIRE) is a transcription factor expressed both in the thymus, by medullary thymic epithelial cells, and in secondary lymphoid organs. AIRE controls the local transcription of organ- specific proteins typically expressed in peripheral tissues, thus allowing the negative selection of self- reactive T cells. The crucial role played by AIRE in central immune tolerance emerged in the studies on the pathogenesis of Autoimmune Polyendocrinopathy-Candidiasis-Ectodermal Dystrophy, a rare inherited polyendocrine/autoimmune disease. Thereafter, several studies found evidences indicating that AIRE impairment might be pathogenically involved in several autoimmune diseases and in tumorigenesis. In this review, we focus on recent advances relative to AIRE's effect on T cell development in physiology and disease. In particular, we address the following issues: 1) AIRE function and mTECs biology, 2) the impact of AIRE gene mutations in autoimmune diseases, and 3) the role of AIRE gene in anti-tumor immune response.

Autoimmune polyendocrine syndrome type 1 (APS-1; OMIM #240300), also referred to as autoimmune polyendocrinopathy-candidiasis-ectodermal dystrophy (APECED), is a rare monogenic autoimmune disorder caused by mutations in the autoimmune regulator (<i>AIRE)</i> gene. APS-1 is classically characterized by a triad of chronic mucocutaneous candidiasis, autoimmune hypoparathyroidism, and autoimmune adrenocortical insufficiency. We report a 5-yr-old female who presented with symptoms of tetany due to hypocalcemia and was subsequently found to be secondary to hypoparathyroidism. Rapid trio whole-genome sequencing revealed compound heterozygous variants in <i>AIRE</i> in the proband, with a paternally inherited, pathogenic, frameshift variant (c.1265delC; p.Pro422LeufsTer58) and a novel, likely pathogenic, maternally inherited missense variant (c.268T>C; p.Tyr90His).

Protection against mucocutaneous candidiasis depends on the T helper (Th)17 pathway, as gene defects affecting its integrity result in inability to clear Candida albicans infection on body surfaces. Moreover, autoantibodies neutralizing Th17 cytokines have been related to chronic candidiasis in a rare inherited disorder called autoimmune polyendocriopathy candidiasis ectodermal dystrophy (APECED) caused by mutations in autoimmune regulator (AIRE) gene. However, the direct pathogenicity of these autoantibodies has not yet been addressed. Here we show that the level of anti-IL17A autoantibodies that develop in aged Aire-deficient mice is not sufficient for conferring susceptibility to oropharyngeal candidiasis. However, patient-derived monoclonal antibodies that cross-react with murine IL-22 increase the fungal burden on C. albicans infected mucosa. Nevertheless, the lack of macroscopically evident infectious pathology on the oral mucosa of infected mice suggests that additional susceptibility factors are needed to precipitate a clinical disease.

Autoimmune-polyendocrinopathy-candidiasis-ectodermal dystrophy (APECED) is a primary immunodeficiency caused by mutations in the autoimmune regulator gene (<i>AIRE</i>). Patients with AIRE mutations are susceptible to <i>Candida albicans</i> infection and present with autoimmune disorders. We previously demonstrated that cytoplasmic AIRE regulates the Syk-dependent Dectin-1 pathway. In this study, we further evaluated direct contact with fungal elements, synapse formation, and the response of macrophage-like THP-1 cells to <i>C. albicans</i> hyphae to determine the role of AIRE upon Dectin receptors function and signaling. We examined the fungal synapse (FS) formation in wild-type and AIRE-knockdown THP-1 cells differentiated to macrophages, as well as monocyte-derived macrophages from APECED patients. We evaluated Dectin-2 receptor signaling, phagocytosis, and cytokine secretion upon hyphal stimulation. AIRE co-localized with Dectin-2 and Syk at the FS upon hyphal stimulation of macrophage-like THP-1 cells. AIRE-knockdown macrophage-like THP-1 cells exhibited less Dectin-1 and Dectin-2 receptors accumulation, decreased signaling pathway activity at the FS, lower <i>C. albicans</i> phagocytosis, and less lysosome formation. Furthermore, IL-1β, IL-6, or TNF-α secretion by AIRE-knockdown macrophage-like THP-1 cells and AIRE-deficient patient macrophages was decreased compared to control cells. Our results suggest that AIRE modulates the FS formation and hyphal recognition and help to orchestrate an effective immune response against <i>C. albicans</i>.
