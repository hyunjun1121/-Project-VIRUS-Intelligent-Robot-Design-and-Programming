When is lorlatinib used?

[PMID: 34589977]
Lorlatinib is a third-generation ALK inhibitor that can overcome the largest number of acquired <i>ALK</i> resistance mutations, including the solvent-front mutation G1202R. Here, we report, for the first time, a novel, sequentially-evolved <i>EML4-ALK</i> variant 3 G1202R/S1206Y double mutation in <i>cis</i> detected in a patient with <i>ALK</i>-positive NSCLC after disease progression on sequential crizotinib, alectinib, and then lorlatinib. Three-dimensional computer modeling of this double mutation and other G1202R-based double mutations with lorlatinib (<i>ALK</i> G1202R/L1196M, <i>ALK</i> G1202R/F1174C, <i>ALK</i> G1202R/l1198F, <i>ALK</i> G1202R/G1269A) were provided to reveal how these double mutations may confer resistance to lorlatinib through diverse steric hindrances in the ALK kinase domain. In addition, we performed a comprehensive literature review on published acquired double or triple <i>ALK</i> mutations that are resistant to lorlatinib from both patient samples and in vitro mutagenesis experiments.

Treatment of advanced stage <i>anaplastic lymphoma kinase</i> (<i>ALK</i>) positive non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) with ALK tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) has been shown to be superior to standard platinum-based chemotherapy. However, secondary progress of disease frequently occurs under ALK inhibitor treatment. The clinical impact of re-biopsies for treatment decisions beyond secondary progress is, however, still under debate. Here, we report on two novel subsequent polyclonal on- and off-target resistance mutations in a patient with <i>ALK</i>-fused NSCLC under ALK inhibitor treatment. A 63-year-old male patient with an advanced stage <i>EML4-ALK</i> fused pulmonary adenocarcinoma was initially successfully treated with the second-generation ALK inhibitor alectinib and upon progressions subsequently with brigatinib, lorlatinib and chemoimmunotherapy (CIT). Progress to alectinib was associated with a so far undescribed <i>ALK</i> mutation (p.A1200_G1201delinsW) which was, however, tractable by brigatinib. An off-target <i>KRAS</i>-mutation (p.Q61K) occurred in association with subsequent progression under second-line TKI treatment. Third-line lorlatinib showed limited efficacy but chemoimmunotherapy resulted in disappearance of the <i>KRAS</i> mutant clone and clinical tumor control for another eight months. In conclusion, we suggest molecular profiling of progressive tumor disease also for <i>ALK</i>-positive NSCLC to personalize treatment in a subgroup of <i>ALK</i>-positive patients.

This is a summary of a research study (known as a clinical trial) called CROWN. The study tested two medicines called lorlatinib and crizotinib in participants with untreated non-small cell lung cancer that had spread to other parts of their body. All those who took part had changes in a gene called ALK, which is involved in cell growth. In total, 296 participants from 23 countries took part. Half the participants took lorlatinib and half took crizotinib. After participants started taking lorlatinib or crizotinib, they were checked regularly to see if their tumors had grown or spread to other parts of their body (known as tumor progression) and to monitor any side effects. After 1 year of treatment, the participants who took lorlatinib were twice as likely to be alive with no tumor growth as the participants who took crizotinib. More participants who took lorlatinib had cancer that shrank (76%) compared with the participants who took crizotinib (58%). This was also true of the participants whose cancer had spread to their brain. The most common side effects in participants who took lorlatinib were increases in the amount of cholesterol and triglycerides (a type of fat) in their blood, swelling, weight gain, nerve damage, unclear thoughts, and diarrhea. Among the participants who took crizotinib, the most common side effects were diarrhea, feeling like you want to throw up, sight problems, swelling, vomiting, changes in liver function, and feeling tired. Overall, the CROWN study showed that fewer participants with advanced ALK+ non-small cell lung cancer died or had tumor growth with lorlatinib compared with crizotinib treatment.
