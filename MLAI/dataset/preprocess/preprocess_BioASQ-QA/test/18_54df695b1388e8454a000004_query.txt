X-linked dystonia-parkinsonism (XDP), or Lubag syndrome, is known to cause progressive dystonia, with or without parkinsonism, among Filipino male adults with maternal roots from the Philippine island of Panay. We present cinematographic material of 11 cases of Lubag carrying the XDP haplotypes who manifest with a wide spectrum of movement disorders, including dystonia, tremor, parkinsonism, myoclonus, chorea, and myorhythmia. Because of overlapping features, Lubag patients are commonly misdiagnosed as idiopathic dystonia, essential tremor, Parkinson's disease, or Parkinson's-plus syndromes. Thus, it is imperative to elicit an exhaustive family history in any Filipino male adult who presents with a movement disorder.

We report a patient with Lubag (X-linked dystonia-parkinsonism) who presented with severe respiratory stridor from adductor laryngeal breathing dystonia. Emergency tracheostomy was necessary, and subsequent laryngeal injection with botulinum toxin led to worsening aspiration. Botulinum toxin injection for severe lingual dystonia was successful.

"Lubag" is an X-linked disorder causing dystonia and parkinsonism that has only been described in families from the Philippines, principally from the island of Panay. We have established linkage between the disease phenotype "lubag" and DNA markers which span the Xp11.22-Xq21.3 region by using a large Filipino family with 8 affected men in three generations. These DNA markers define an interval of about 20 centimorgans in the pericentromeric region of the X chromosome as the most likely site of the disease locus XDPD (X-linked dystonia-parkinsonism). XDPD has a maximum multipoint log likelihood ratio score (Zmax) of about 4.6 over the interval from Xq12 to Xq21.31 (DXS159-DXYS1X). The co-occurrence of dystonia and parkinsonism in lubag and in other known disorders suggests there may be a common pathogenetic mechanism. Identification of the genetic defect in this family may provide an important clue toward understanding the pathogenesis and pathophysiology of both dystonia and parkinsonism.

Sex-linked dystonia parkinsonism (XDP, DYT3, "Lubag") is an adult-onset, progressive, debilitating movement disorder first described in Filipino males from Panay Islands in 1975. XDP manifests predominantly as torsion dystonia, later combined with or sometimes replaced with parkinsonism. Within the Island of Panay, the prevalence rate is highest in the province of Capiz, where 1:4000 men suffer from the disorder. There is a high degree of penetrance and generalization. While women often serve as carriers, XDP is not limited to men. An updated XDP Philippine registry (as of January 2010) has identified 505 cases, with 500 males and 5 females. While some report that females may carry a milder form of the disorder, in our experience, both sexes generally follow a similar progressive clinical course.

Lubag disease is a genetic X-linked dystonia-parkinsonism syndrome afflicting Filipino men. This disease is characterized by dystonia dominating the first 10-15 years of the disorder, which is associated with or replaced by parkinsonian features in later years of life. A 49-year-old man with Lubag disease underwent general anesthesia for deep brain stimulation (DBS) surgery. Anesthesia was maintained mainly with propofol, remifentanil, rocuronium bromide, and sevoflurane. During magnetic resonance imaging, the patient was anesthetized with midazolam, fentanyl, and rocuronium bromide. The surgery was completed safely using these anesthetic agents. After DBS, some symptoms including involuntary movement improved within 10 days.

X-Linked Dystonia-Parkinsonism (XDP or "Lubag") is a progressive neurodegenerative disorder unique to the Island of Panay in the Philippines. Imaging and autopsy studies have suggested involvement of the caudate and putamen in late stages. Because the clinical presentation of patients with XDP resembles that of patients with Parkinson disease or dystonia, it is reasonable to predict the neuropsychological profile might be similar; however, the neuropsychological profile of a XDP patient has not previously been published. We present the neuropsychological findings of a 67-year-old gentleman with a 10-year history of XDP who presented with parkinsonian and dystonic symptoms. He was evaluated for suitability for deep brain stimulation surgery. Neuropsychological findings demonstrated diffuse impairment involving memory, visuospatial, language, and executive functioning.

"Lubag" or X-linked dystonia-parkinsonism (XDP) is a genetic syndrome afflicting Filipino men. Intracranial surgical procedures for Lubag have been unsuccessful. We report a 45-year-old Filipino male with genetically confirmed XDP who underwent bilateral pallidal deep brain stimulation (DBS) surgery. The patient started to exhibit improvement on initial programming, most notably of his severe jaw-opening dystonia. At 1-year follow-up, his Burke-Fahn-Marsden dystonia score and motor Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale score were improved by 71% and 62%, respectively, with the stimulators on compared to stimulators off state. Bilateral pallidal DBS may be a viable option for Lubag patients with medically refractory symptoms.

The clinico-pathological study of a new type of familial parkinsonism with striatal degeneration is reported. The inheritance mode was autosomal recessive, and three out of four offspring of married cousins developed parkinsonism in their early adulthood. Their clinical signs were rigidity, bradykinesia, postural instability and dysarthria. These symptoms were slowly progressive and responsive to levodopa therapy to a variable degree. On cerebral magnetic resonance imaging, T2 and proton density-weighted images showed hyperintensity in the bilateral putamina. The neuropathological study of one case revealed atrophy of the bilateral putamina and caudate nuclei, and a severe neuronal loss and gliosis in the putamina. Patchy mosaicism of normal and degenerated tissue was observed in the putamina. A similar mode of the degeneration was mildly seen in the caudate nuclei. The substantia nigra showed atrophy of the pars reticulata, and mild to moderate neuronal loss of the pars compacta with rostral dominance, but no Lewy bodies were observed. These neuropathological findings differed from those of Parkinson's disease or juvenile parkinsonism, but mimic to those of X-linked dystonia parkinsonism (Lubag). It seems that this familial bilateral striatal degeneration is a new variant of familial parkinsonism.

We report on an Italian family in which three brothers and their maternal grandfather had a generalized early-onset dystonia with mild parkinsonian signs. Genetic testing excluded the rapid-onset dystonia-parkinsonism locus (DYT12; OMIM*128235), autosomal recessive Parkin locus (PARK2; OMIM *602544), and DYT1 dystonia. Three affected siblings were found to share an identical haplotype at the X-linked dystonia-parkinsonism locus (XDP; Lubag; OMIM*314250). This haplotype differed from the haplotype observed in Filipino patients, ruling out the hypothesis of a common underlying mutation. In addition, direct sequencing analysis of the putative disease causing changes observed in Filipino patients were not found in the Italian patients. The condition we describe could be a newly recognized dystonia syndrome with parkinsonism.

Despite recessive inheritance, X-linked dystonia-parkinsonism (Lubag disease) has also been described in women presenting with a late-onset isolated parkinsonian syndrome. Interestingly, unlike in other populations, there is a slight female predominance in the prevalence of parkinsonism in the Philippines. In a Filipino woman with suspected Parkinson disease, we confirmed the presence of all changes specific for X-linked dystonia-parkinsonism in genomic DNA. Subsequently, we analyzed complementary DNA and evaluated the methylation status of the androgen receptor gene. Owing to extremely skewed (98%:2%) X-chromosome inactivation, the patient expressed almost solely the mutated allele in a disease-specific change, rendering her molecularly comparable with a hemizygously affected man. Skewed X-chromosome inactivation is the likely cause of parkinsonism in this heterozygous mutation carrier. Because women carriers of the genetic changes specific for X-linked dystonia-parkinsonism are common in the Philippines, the epigenetic factor of nonrandom X-chromosome inactivation may contribute to the skewing of the sex prevalence of parkinsonism toward women in this country, warranting further investigation.

Lubag (X-linked dystonia-parkinsonism) has been considered a sex-linked recessive trait and has been mapped to the pericentromeric region of the X chromosome. We studied a 54-year-old man with lubag and two of his female first cousins. Genetic typing was carried out using X chromosome markers. Fluorodopa PET was performed on the man and one of the women. The man had moderately severe parkinsonism and dystonia. A 61-year-old female first cousin had mild left-sided dystonia and her 54-year-old sister had mild generalized chorea. Genetic typing data revealed that all three inherited an X chromosome with marker alleles strongly associated with lubag. Cytologic analysis did not reveal evidence of X chromosomal deletion. Fluorodopa PET in both the man and one affected cousin revealed reduced striatal uptake rate constants consistent with nigrostriatal involvement. These observations suggest that lubag may be a codominant disorder and that it is possible for women to be affected.

Regional and global metabolic rates for glucose (rCMRGlc and GMR) were estimated using [18F]fluorodeoxyglucose and positron emission tomography in 3 patients with Filipino X-linked dystonia-parkinsonism (lubag). In all 3 patients a selective reduction in normalized striatal glucose metabolism (rCMRGlc/GMR) was observed compared with 15 normal volunteer subjects. Presynaptic nigrostriatal function was assessed in these patients using [18F]fluorodopa and positron emission tomography. Striatal rate constants for [18F]flurodopa uptake were found to be in the normal range in all 3 patients with lubag. These findings suggest that the extrapyramidal manifestations of lubag are metabolically localized to the striatum and that clinical parkinsonism in these patients may be secondary to extranigral factors.

We administered a culturally corrected University of Pennsylvania Smell Identification Test (ccUPSIT) consisting of 25 odor items to 20 patients with 'Lubag' or X-linked dystonia-parkinsonism and 20 control subjects matched by sex, age, educational background, smoking history, and geographical origin. The mean ccUPSIT score of Lubag patients (18 +/- 3.19) was statistically lower (P = 0.003) than controls (20.5 +/- 3.02). The smell scores did not correlate with phenotype, severity of dystonia, or duration of disease. Nine of 20 Lubag patients (45%) had ccUPSIT scores below the mean, with the lowest score being 11. This pilot study suggests that olfactory dysfunction may occur in Lubag patients.

The list of genetic causes of syndromes of dystonia parkinsonism grows constantly. As a consequence, the diagnosis becomes more and more challenging for the clinician. Here, we summarize the important causes of dystonia parkinsonism including autosomal-dominant, recessive, and x-linked forms. We cover dopa-responsive dystonia, Wilson's disease, Parkin-, PINK1-, and DJ-1-associated parkinsonism (PARK2, 6, and 7), x-linked dystonia-parkinsonism/Lubag (DYT3), rapid-onset dystonia-parkinsonism (DYT12) and DYT16 dystonia, the syndromes of Neurodegeneration with Brain Iron Accumulation (NBIA) including pantothenate kinase (PANK2)- and PLA2G6 (PARK14)-associated neurodegeneration, neuroferritinopathy, Kufor-Rakeb disease (PARK9) and the recently described SENDA syndrome; FBXO7-associated neurodegeneration (PARK15), autosomal-recessive spastic paraplegia with a thin corpus callosum (SPG11), and dystonia parkinsonism due to mutations in the SLC6A3 gene encoding the dopamine transporter. They have in common that in all these syndromes there may be a combination of dystonic and parkinsonian features, which may be complicated by pyramidal tract involvement. The aim of this review is to familiarize the clinician with the phenotypes of these disorders.

To present the first genetically supported case of X linked dystonia parkinsonism (XDP) or 'lubag' reported in an Australian hospital. We performed PCR amplification of microsatellite markers in and around the previously described segregating region for the XDP haplotype. Linkage was confirmed using markers ZNF261, DXS10017, and DXS10018. We present the first case of XDP or 'lubag' reported in an Australian hospital. It highlights the enlarging role of genetic testing in facilitating the diagnosis of dystonia in a clinical environment where a disease like XDP is rare, and where a corroborating family history may be unavailable.

X-linked dystonia-parkinsonism (XDP) or "lubag" is an X-linked recessive disorder that afflicts Filipino men, and rarely, women. Genetic confirmation is performed through haplotyping or detection of disease-specific changes in the DYT3 gene. To describe the phenotypes and molecular data of 8 symptomatic female patients with XDP from 5 kindreds. Case series. The average age of onset of symptoms was 52 years (range, 26-75 years). Six of 8 patients had parkinsonism, whereas only 1 had dystonia. The initial symptom was focal tremor or parkinsonism in 4, chorea in 3, and focal dystonia (cervical) in 1. Seven of 8 patients had slow or no progression of their symptoms and required no treatment. The patient with disabling parkinsonism was responsive to carbidopa/levodopa. Seven were heterozygous for the XDP haplotype, whereas 1 was homozygous. The phenotypes of female patients with XDP may include parkinsonism, dystonia, myoclonus, tremor, and chorea. The dystonia, if present, is mild and usually nonprogressive. Similar to men with XDP, parkinsonism is a frequent symptom in women. In contrast to men, affected women have a more benign phenotype, older age of onset, and milder course. Extreme X-inactivation mosaic may be a cause of symptoms in women with XDP, but a homozygously affected woman has also been observed.

Lubag is an x-linked recessive dystonia parkinsonism that affects Filipino men originating principally from the Panay Island. Linkage analysis has confirmed the mode of inheritance and localized the disease gene to the proximal long arm of the x-chromosome. We studied the brain of a 34 year old Filipino man affected with lubag. He developed truncal dystonia at age 30, which subsequently generalized. With disease progression, he also presented with parkinsonism including, rigidity, bradykinesia, and impaired balance. His symptoms were largely unaffected by medication and, at age 34, he underwent a right cryothalamotomy. He died suddenly 2 days after the procedure. The principal neuropathological findings were neuronal loss and a multifocal mosaic pattern of astrocytosis restricted to the caudate and lateral putamen. Similar findings have been reported in two other men with dystonia--one Filipino and the other non-Filipino. The similar pathology of the two Filipino men suggests that this is the pathology of lubag. Recognition of this pathology in a non-Filipino man suggests that the mutation causing lubag may not be restricted to the Filipino population.

X-chromosomal dystonia parkinsonism syndrome (XDP, 'lubag') is associated with sequence changes within the TAF1/DYT3 multiple transcript system. Although most sequence changes are intronic, one, disease-specific single-nucleotide change 3 (DSC3), is located within an exon (d4). Transcribed exon d4 occurs as part of multiple splice variants. These variants include exons d3 and d4 spliced to exons of TAF1, and an independent transcript composed of exons d2-d4. Location of DSC3 in exon d4 and utilization of this exon in multiple splice variants suggest an important role of DSC3 in the XDP pathogenesis. To test this hypothesis, we transfected neuroblastoma cells with four expression constructs, including exons d2-d4 [d2-d4/wild-type (wt) and d2-d4/DSC3] and d3-d4 (d3-d4/wt and d3-d4/DSC3). Expression profiling revealed a dramatic effect of DSC3 on overall gene expression. Three hundred and sixty-two genes differed between cells containing d2-d4/wt and d2-d4/DSC3. Annotation clustering revealed enrichment of genes related to vesicular transport, dopamine metabolism, synapse function, Ca(2+) metabolism and oxidative stress. Two hundred and eleven genes were differentially expressed in d3-d4/wt versus d3-d4/DSC3. Annotation clustering highlighted genes in signal transduction and cell-cell interaction. The data show an important role of physiologically occurring transcript d2-d4 in normal brain function. Interference with this role by DSC3 is a likely pathological mechanism in XDP. Disturbance of dopamine function and of Ca(2+) metabolism can explain abnormal movement; loss of protection against reactive oxygen species may account for the neurodegenerative changes in XDP. Although d3-d4 also affect genes potentially related to neurodegenerative processes, their physiologic role as splice variants of TAF1 awaits further exploration.
