What are check point inhibitors?

[PMID: 24485523]
Inhibitory receptors on immune system cells respond to membrane-bound and soluble ligands to abort or mitigate the intensity of immune responses by raising thresholds of activation, halting proliferation, favoring apoptosis or inhibiting/deviating effector function differentiation. Such evolutionarily selected inhibitory mechanisms are termed check-points and therefore check-point inhibitors empower any ongoing anti-cancer immune response that might have been too weak or exhausted. Monoclonal antibodies (mAb) interfering with CTLA-4-CD80/86, PD-1 - PD-L1, TIM-3-GAL9 and LAG3-MHC-II belong to this category of check-point inhibitors. The anti-CTLA-4 mAb ipilimumab has been approved for metastatic melanoma. Anti-PD-1 and anti-PD-L1 mAbs have shown extremely encouraging clinical activity. The potential of combination strategies with these agents has recently been highlighted by clinical observations on CTLA-4+PD-1 combined blockade in melanoma patients.

The treatment of melanoma is evolving rapidly over the past few years. Patients with BRAFv600 mutations can be treated with a combination of a BRAF-inhibitor and an MEK-inhibitor. Patients with BRAF wild-type tumors and BRAFv600 mutated tumors can be treated with immunotherapy i.e. check point inhibitors. We conducted a comprehensive review of the literature on the efficacy and predictive markers, safety, and pharmacoeconomics of ipilimumab in melanoma Expert commentary: Ipilimumab was the first check point inhibitor reaching the clinic, gaining FDA and EMA approval for metastatic melanoma in 2011. Ipilimumab was also approved by FDA in the adjuvant setting for patients with high risk, stage III melanoma. The anti-PD1 directed antibodies pembrolizumab and nivolumab are superior to single agent ipilimumab, which is no longer considered the standard first line treatment in metastatic melanoma. The addition ipilimumab to nivolumab is associated with a higher response rate and a better PFS, particularly in patients with PD-L1 negative tumors, albeit at the cost of a steep increase in grade 3-4 adverse event rate. Definitive survival data on this combination are pending and the selection of patients potentially requiring the combination and its pharmacoeconomic implications are to be elucidated.

Drug resistance of tumor cells to chemotherapy is limiting the therapeutic efficacy of most anticancer drugs and represents a major obstacle in medical oncology. However, treatment of various human malignancies with biologics, mostly monoclonal antibodies (mAbs), is not limited by such chemoresistance mechanisms. However, other resistance or evasion mechanisms limit the efficacy to anticancer therapeutic mAbs that engage tumor-associated antigens on the surface of the malignant cells. Immune checkpoint blocking monoclonal antibodies are heralded as a promising therapeutic approach in clinical oncology. These mAbs do not directly attack the malignant cells as most anticancer mAbs; rather, they enhance the anti-tumor response of the immune system by targeting immune regulatory pathways. Three mAbs targeting immune checkpoint molecules are currently used in the clinic and new mAbs that target other potential inhibitory targets are being actively investigated. This therapeutic approach, while proving as highly beneficial for many patients, is prone to toxicities and side effects of an autoimmune nature. Defining suitable management algorithms and biomarkers that predict therapeutic effects and adverse toxicity are required to provide survival benefit for larger numbers of cancer patients. Overcoming these challenges, along with opportunities for new agents and combinatorial strategies are the main focus of immune checkpoint blockade research today.

The immune system plays an active role in the pathogenesis of ovarian cancer (OC), as well as in the mechanisms of disease progression and overall survival (OS). Immunotherapy in gynecological cancers could help to revert immunosuppression and lymphocyte depletion due to prior treatments. Current immunotherapies for ovarian cancer, like all cancer immunotherapy, are based on either stimulating the immune system or reverting immune suppression. Several approaches have been used, including therapeutic vaccines, monoclonal antibodies; checkpoint inhibitors and adoptive T cell transfer. Most of these therapies are still in early-phase testing (phase I and II) for ovarian cancer, but the initial data in ovarian cancer and successful use in other types of cancers suggests some of these approaches may ultimately prove useful for ovarian cancer as well. Ovarian cancer vaccines have shown only a modest benefit in ovarian cancer when used as monotherapy, but these agents may be able to enhance antitumor activity when combined with chemotherapy, checkpoint inhibitors, or other immunotherapies. Monoclonal antibodies have been explored in ovarian cancer but despite encouraging phase II data, randomized studies failed to demonstrate significant clinical benefit. Check point inhibitors have promising activity in several solid tumors and have demonstrated a favorable toxicity profile. Data from early clinical trials utilizing PD1 and PD-L1 inhibitors showed encouraging results. Ongoing clinical trials are evaluating the role of check point inhibitors in combination with chemotherapy. Adoptive T cell transfer involves the infusion of ex vivo activated and expanded tumor specific T cells, using various sources and types of T cells. While this approach has been explored in several hematologic malignancies, it constitutes early research in ovarian cancer. Immunotherapy remains investigational in ovarian cancer and the benefit of this approach in improving progression-free survival (PFS) or OS is unknown. Previous clinical trials have not selected patients based on biomarkers and this may explain the negative results. We expect to discover that tumor response will relate to the patient's immune features and specific tumor characteristics. We are only beginning to realize the potential of immunotherapy for ovarian cancer patients, and one goal of future clinical trials will be to identify subsets of patient based on histologic, molecular, and immune characteristics.

Glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) is the most frequent brain tumor. Despite recent advances in treatment approaches the prognosis remains poor, with a median overall survival of 14.6 months. Immunotherapy is the subject of ongoing research and its benefit is becoming evident in other malignancies. Immune check-points such as cytotoxic T lymphocyte associated antigen 4 (CTLA-4), programmed cell death receptor (PD-1) and indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase (IDO) reduce immune response. To clarify the role of immune check point inhibitors in GBM management. Preclinical and clinical trials of immune check-point inhibitors in GBM were obtained by searching for English peer-reviewed articles on PubMed databases, trials registered on clincaltrials. gov and abstracts recently presented at international congresses. Immune check point inhibitors may be of critical importance for the design of future immunotherapy approaches in GBM management. Immune check-point inhibitors should be considered a promising treatment option in GBM.

Several cancers are highly refractory to conventional chemotherapy. The survival of tumors in several cases is assisted by checkpoint immunomodulation to maintain the imbalance between immune surveillance and cancer cell proliferation. Check point antibody inhibitors, such as anti-PD-1/PD-L1, are a novel class of inhibitors that function as a tumor suppressing factor via modulation of immune cell-tumor cell interaction. These checkpoint blockers are rapidly becoming a highly promising cancer therapeutic approach that yields remarkable antitumor responses with limited side effects. In recent times, more than four check point antibody inhibitors have been commercialized for targeting PD-1, PDL-1, and CTLA-4. Despite the huge success and efficacy of the anti-PD therapy response, it is limited to specific types of cancers, which attributes to the insufficient and heterogeneous expression of PD-1 in the tumor microenvironment. Herein, we review the current landscape of the PD-1/PD-L1 mechanistic role in tumor immune evasion and therapeutic outcome for cancer treatment. We also review the current progress in clinical trials, combination of drug therapy with immunotherapy, safety, and future of check point inhibitors for multiple types of cancer.

Till now, the prognosis of advanced gastric cancer looked dreadful; thus the search for newer better approaches for this lethal disease has been a strategic target for cancer researchers. In recent years, important immunobiological aspects of the tumor have been revealed with the subsequent proposal of immune check point inhibitors to target these pathways. Clinically, unselected use of immune checkpoint inhibitors in gastric cancer has been deemed with failure; in contrast to the clear success of more recent studies reporting on the use of pembrolizumab in molecularly selected patients. This may illustrate that any future use of immune checkpoint inhibitors in gastric cancer has to be molecularly supported. This review provides a delicate dissection of the clinical and immunobiological considerations underlying the use of these agents in addition to a thorough review of the published clinical data of immune checkpoint inhibitors in gastric cancer.

Immune check-point inhibitors are now employed as single-agents in current practice for the treatment of advanced non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), while combinations of different inhibitors are being evaluated in clinical trials. Although the safety profile of these compounds, with particular reference to drugs targeting programmed death protein 1 (PD-1) and its ligand (PD-L1), is generally considered manageable, peculiar, immune-related toxicities may onset. Areas covered: This review focuses on the immune-related adverse events (irAEs) observed during immune check-point blockade in NSCLC and their management. The authors report the incidence of irAEs based on the currently available data involving NSCLC and provide recommendations on the general approach to irAEs, as well as indications for the most relevant site-specific events. Expert opinion: Since irAEs may involve a wide range of organs and systems and are potentially reversible if promptly treated, early diagnosis should always be achieved; this might be particularly challenging when other potential causes of toxicity are suspected, such as infections or concurrent treatments. Finally, drugs active on the PD-1/PD-L1 axis appear to be generally manageable even when they are administered to patients with relevant comorbidities, provided that adequate clinical monitoring is performed.

Survival for patients with multiple myeloma has significantly improved in the last decade in large part due to the development of proteasome inhibitors and immunomodulatory drugs. These next generation agents with novel mechanisms of action as well as targeted therapies are being used both in the preclinical and clinical settings for patients with myeloma. These agents include monoclonal antibodies, deacetylase inhibitors, kinase inhibitors, agents affecting various signaling pathways, immune check point inhibitors, and other targeted therapies. In some cases, off target effects of these therapies can lead to unanticipated effects on the kidney that can range from electrolyte disorders to AKI. In this review, we discuss the nephrotoxicities of novel agents currently in practice as well as in development for the treatment of myeloma.

The recent successes of immune check point targeting therapies in treating cancer patients has driven a resurgence of interest in targeting these pathways in chronically infected patients. While still in early stages, basic and clinical data suggest that blockade of CTLA-4 and PD-1 can be beneficial in the treatment of chronic HIV, HBV, and HCV infection, as well as other chronic maladies. Furthermore, novel inhibitory receptors such as Tim-3, LAG-3, and TIGIT are the potential next wave of check points that can be manipulated for the treatment of chronic infection. Blockade of these pathways influences more than simply T cell responses, and may provide new therapeutic options for chronically infected patients.
