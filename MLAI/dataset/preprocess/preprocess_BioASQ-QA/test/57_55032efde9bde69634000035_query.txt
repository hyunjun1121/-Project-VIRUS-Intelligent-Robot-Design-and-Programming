Which receptor is targeted by telcagepant?

[PMID: 21350792]
Dose-response curves for headaches relief and adverse events (AEs) are presented for five triptans: sumatriptan, zolmitriptan, naratriptan, almotriptan, and frovatriptan, and the CGRP antagonist telcagepant. The upper part of the efficacy curve of the triptans is generally flat, the so-called ceiling effect; and none of the oral triptans, even in high doses, are as effective as subcutaneous sumatriptan, In contrast, AEs increases with increasing dose without a ceiling effect. The optimal dose for the triptans is mainly determined by tolerability. Telcagepant has an excellent tolerability and can be used in migraine patients with cardiovascular co-morbidity. Based on the literature the triptans and telcagepant are rated in a table for efficacy and tolerability.

While triptans, the 5-HT1B/1D agonists, are effective and generally well-tolerated in many patients up to one-third of migraine patients either may not respond well to triptans, may not tolerate their side effects, or may have contraindications that preclude their use. Recurrence, triptan-related side effects, and cardiovascular constriction effects are demerits for acute migraine treatment. CGRP receptor antagonists, the so-called gepants, were clearely designed and expected to be better than triptans. CGRP is located in sensory nerve endings around cranial blood vessels. CGRP is a strong dilator of cerebral arteries and intravenous infusion of CGRP cause a migraine attack. Olcegepant is the first selective CGRP receptor antagonist of proven efficacy in migraine. Olcegepant could only be administered intravenously and never taken beyond Phase II. Telcagepant is orally available and several completed Phase III trials have revealed positive results. In several comparative studies of telcagepant and triptans, telcegepant did not appeared more effective than zolmitriptan or rizatriptan, although it had fewer triptan-related adverse events and drug-related adverse enents. A small number of patients taking olcegepant showed marked elevation in liver transaminase levels. It was decided to discontinue development of olcegepant. New CGRP receptor antagonists would be expected for acute migraine treatment.

Although the triptan drugs provide effective relief from migraine for many patients, a substantial number of affected individuals are unresponsive to these compounds, and such therapy can also lead to a range of adverse effects. Telcagepant represents a new class of antimigraine drug-the calcitonin gene-related peptide receptor blockers. This compound exerts its effects by blocking receptors for the calcitonin-gene-related peptide at several sites in the trigeminal and central nervous systems, resulting in pain relief. Telcagepant does not cause vasoconstriction, a major limitation in the use of triptans. Comparisons with triptans in clinical trials for acute treatment of migraine attacks revealed clinical effects similar to those of triptans but better than those of placebo. Telcagepant might provide hope for those who have a poor response to, or are unable to use, older drugs. In patients who need prophylaxis because of frequent attacks of migraine, topiramate is a first-line drug for migraine prevention in many countries; it is generally safe and reasonably well tolerated. Data suggest that topiramate could aid reversion of chronic migraine to episodic migraine.

Calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP) receptor antagonists have recently come to attention with the development of olcegepant and telcagepant for the treatment of migraine. The availability of high-affinity, non-peptide antagonists opens the way for trials of these compounds in other conditions where CGRP antagonism might be useful, such as septic shock and inhibition of angiogenesis. This review summarises knowledge about the structure and signalling properties of the CGRP receptor. The clinical ramifications of targeting the CGRP receptor, the profiles of existing antagonists and the requirements for screening new compounds will be discussed. Readers will gain an overview of how current non-peptide antagonists seem to bind similar epitopes contributed by both calcitonin receptor-like receptor (CLR) and receptor activity-modifying protein 1 (RAMP1), the main CGRP receptor subunits. We will discuss how current antagonists have low bioavailability, limiting their use. For selectivity at CGRP receptors, it will be necessary to target parts of the receptor influenced by both RAMP1 and CLR. For the design of radically new antagonists, more structural information on the receptor is needed. Current screens are largely based on measuring CGRP-mediated changes in cAMP. CGRP receptors can influence other signalling pathways and pathway-selective allosteric antagonists may be useful, but more information is needed about the mechanism of action of CGRP to assess the value of this.

Calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP) is a potent neuropeptide whose agonist interaction with the CGRP receptor (CGRP-R) in the periphery promotes vasodilation, neurogenic inflammation and trigeminovascular sensory activation. This process is implicated in the cause of migraine headaches, and CGRP-R antagonists in clinical development have proven effective in treating migraine-related pain in humans. CGRP-R is expressed on blood vessel smooth muscle and sensory trigeminal neurons and fibers in the periphery as well as in the central nervous system. However, it is not clear what role the inhibition of central CGRP-R plays in migraine pain relief. To this end, the CGRP-R positron emission tomography (PET) tracer [(11)C]MK-4232 (2-[(8R)-8-(3,5-difluorophenyl)-6,8-[6-(11)C]dimethyl-10-oxo-6,9-diazaspiro[4.5]decan-9-yl]-N-[(2R)-2'-oxospiro[1,3-dihydroindene-2,3'-1H-pyrrolo[2,3-b]pyridine]-5-yl]acetamide) was discovered and developed for use in clinical PET studies. In rhesus monkeys and humans, [(11)C]MK-4232 displayed rapid brain uptake and a regional brain distribution consistent with the known distribution of CGRP-R. Monkey PET studies with [(11)C]MK-4232 after intravenous dosing with CGRP-R antagonists validated the ability of [(11)C]MK-4232 to detect changes in CGRP-R occupancy in proportion to drug plasma concentration. Application of [(11)C]MK-4232 in human PET studies revealed that telcagepant achieved only low receptor occupancy at an efficacious dose (140 mg PO). Therefore, it is unlikely that antagonism of central CGRP-R is required for migraine efficacy. However, it is not known whether high central CGRP-R antagonism may provide additional therapeutic benefit.

Calcitonin gene related peptide (CGRP) has been proposed to contribute to pain transmission and inflammation and for these reasons to the mechanism of migraine. CGRP is, in fact, expressed in and released from a subset of polymodal primary sensory neurons of the trigeminal ganglion. Release of CGRP in the dorsal spinal cord has been associated to nociceptive transmission, and release from perivascular nerve endings causes neurogenic vasodilatation. CGRP levels increase in the cranial circulation during migraine attacks, and GRP injection in migraineurs results in migraine-like attacks. Most importantly, two chemically unrelated CGRP-receptor antagonists, the parenteral agent, olcegepant, and the orally available telcagepant demonstrated efficacy in the treatment of migraine attacks, thus supporting CGRP as an important mediator in migraine.

To evaluate the long-term tolerability of telcagepant for acute treatment of intermittent migraine attacks. Background.- Telcagepant is a calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP) receptor antagonist being investigated for the acute treatment of migraine. Migraine patients were randomized 2:1 to double-blind treatment with telcagepant 280/300 mg or rizatriptan 10 mg for an acute mild, moderate, or severe migraine. Patients could administer a second dose within 2-24 hours for nonresponse or migraine recurrence. Patients could treat up to 8 attacks per month for up to 18 months. Safety assessments included spontaneous reports of adverse events and collection of vital signs, electrocardiograms, and laboratory assessments. The primary endpoint was the percentage of patients with ≥ 1 triptan-related adverse events in the 14-day period post dose. Of 1068 patients randomized, 641 (90%) patients treated ≥ 1 attack with telcagepant and 313 (88%) treated ≥ 1 attack with rizatriptan. A total of 19,820 attacks were treated with telcagepant (mean per patient = 31) and 10,981 with rizatriptan (mean per patient = 35). Fewer triptan-related adverse events (difference: -6.2%; 95% CI -10.4, -2.6; P < .001) and drug-related adverse events (difference: -15.6%; 95% CI -22.2, -9.0) were reported for telcagepant vs rizatriptan. The most common adverse events appeared to have generally similar incidence proportions between the treatment groups. Those with an incidence > 5% in the telcagepant group were dry mouth (9.7%, rizatriptan = 13.7%), somnolence (9.2%, rizatriptan = 16.6%), dizziness (8.9%, rizatriptan = 10.2%), and nausea (9.0%, rizatriptan = 6.4%). Telcagepant was generally well tolerated when administered for the acute intermittent treatment of migraine for up to 18 months. The incidences of triptan-related and drug-related adverse events favored telcagepant over rizatriptan.

To assess the effect of the calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP) receptor antagonist, telcagepant, on the haemodynamic response to sublingual nitroglycerin (NTG). Twenty-two healthy male volunteers participated in a randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind, two-period, crossover study. Subjects received 500 mg telcagepant or placebo followed, 1.5 h later, by 0.4 mg NTG. To assess the haemodynamic response the following vascular parameters were measured: blood pressure, aortic augmentation index (AIx) and brachial artery diameter (BAD). Data are presented as mean (95% confidence interval, CI). The aortic AIx following NTG decreased by -18.50 (-21.02, -15.98) % after telcagepant vs. -17.28 (-19.80, -14.76) % after placebo. The BAD fold increase following NTG was 1.14 (1.12, 1.17) after telcagepant vs. 1.13 (1.10, 1.15) after placebo. For both AIx and BAD, the hypothesis that telcagepant does not significantly affect the changes induced by NTG is supported (P < 0.0001). In addition, no vasoconstrictor effect of telcagepant could be demonstrated. Telcagepant did not affect NTG-induced haemodynamic changes. These data suggest that NTG-induced vasodilation is not CGRP dependent.

Calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP) probably has a role in migraine pathophysiology, and antagonism of its receptors might provide treatment without the vasoconstrictor effects of triptans. We aimed to assess the clinical profile of MK-0974 (telcagepant), an orally bioavailable antagonist of CGRP receptor. In a randomised, parallel-treatment, placebo-controlled, double-blind, trial at 81 sites in the Europe and the USA, adults with migraine diagnosed by International Headache Society criteria treated moderate or severe attacks with either oral telcagepant 150 mg or 300 mg, zolmitriptan 5 mg, or placebo. The five co-primary endpoints were pain freedom, pain relief, or absence of photophobia, phonophobia, or nausea at 2 h after treatment. Analysis was by the full analysis set and multiplicity was controlled for with a step-down closed-testing procedure. This trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT00442936. 1380 patients were randomly assigned to receive telcagepant 150 mg (n=333) or 300 mg (354), zolmitriptan (345), or placebo (348). Telcagepant 300 mg was more effective than placebo for pain freedom (95 [27%] of 353 patients vs 33 [10%] of 343 [p<0.0001]), pain relief (194 [55%] of 353 vs 95 [28%] of 343 [p<0.0001]), and absences of phonophobia (204 [58%] of 353 vs 126 [37%] of 342 [p<0.0001]), photophobia (180 [51%] of 353 vs 99 [29%] of 342 [p<0.0001]), and nausea (229 [65%] of 352 vs 189 [55%] of 342 [p=0.0061]). Efficacy of telcagepant 300 mg and zolmitriptan 5 mg were much the same, and both were more effective than telcagepant 150 mg. Adverse events were recorded for 31% taking telcagepant 150 mg, 37% taking telcagepant 300 mg, 51% taking zolmitriptan 5 mg, and 32% taking placebo. Telcagepant 300 mg is effective as an acute treatment for migraine with efficacy comparable to that of zolmitriptan 5 mg, but with fewer associated adverse effects. Merck Research Laboratories.

The conceptual shift of our understanding of migraine from a vascular disorder to a brain disorder has dramatically altered the approach to the development of new medicines in the field. Current pharmacologic treatments of acute migraine consist of nonspecific and relatively specific agents. Migraine-specific drugs comprise two classes, the ergot alkaloid derivatives and the triptans, serotonin 5-HT(1B/1D) receptor agonists. The ergots, consisting of ergotamine and dihydroergotamine (DHE), are the oldest specific antimigraine drugs available and are considered relatively safe and effective. Ergotamine has been used less extensively because of its adverse effects; DHE is better tolerated. The triptan era, beginning in the 1990s, was a period of considerable change, although these medicines retained vasoconstrictor actions. New methods of delivering older drugs include orally inhaled DHE and the transdermal formulation of sumatriptan, both currently under study. Novel medicines being developed are targeted at neural sites of action. Serotonin 5-HT(1F) receptor agonists have proven effective in phase II studies and have no vascular actions. Calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP) receptor antagonists are another promising nonvasoconstrictor approach to treating acute migraine. Olcegepant (BIBN4096BS) and telcagepant (MK-0974) have been shown to be safe and effective in phase I, II, and (for telcagepant) phase III clinical trials. Other targets under investigation include glutamate (AMPA/kainate), TRPV1, prostanoid EP4, and nitric oxide synthase. With new neural targets and the potential for therapeutic advances, the next era of antimigraine medications is near.

Calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP) is linked to migraine and other primary headache disorders. It is found in every location described in migraine genesis and processing, including meninges, trigeminal ganglion, trigeminocervical complex, brainstem nuclei, and cortex. It is released in animal models following stimulation of the CNS similar to that seen in migraine, and triptans inhibit this release. Injection of CGRP into migraineurs results in delayed headache similar to migraine. Elevation of CGRP occurs during migraine, resolving following migraine-specific treatment. Finally, and most importantly, CGRP receptor antagonists terminate migraine with efficacy similar to triptans. Both intravenous olcegepant (BIBN 4096 BS) and oral telcagepant (MK-0974) have been effective, safe, and well tolerated in phase I and II studies. Telcagepant is currently in phase III trials, and preliminary results are favorable. The potential for a migraine-specific medication without vasoconstrictive or vascular side effects is enormous. CGRP receptor blockade may also have applications in other pathologic and pain syndromes.

The calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP) receptor is a heterodimer of two membrane proteins: calcitonin receptor-like receptor (CLR) and receptor activity-modifying protein 1 (RAMP1). CLR is a class B G-protein-coupled receptor (GPCR), possessing a characteristic large amino-terminal extracellular domain (ECD) important for ligand recognition and binding. Dimerization of CLR with RAMP1 provides specificity for CGRP versus related agonists. Here we report the expression, purification, and refolding of a soluble form of the CGRP receptor comprising a heterodimer of the CLR and RAMP1 ECDs. The extracellular protein domains corresponding to residues 23-133 of CLR and residues 26-117 of RAMP1 were shown to be sufficient for formation of a stable, monodisperse complex. The binding affinity of the purified ECD complex for the CGRP peptide was significantly lower than that of the native receptor (IC(50) of 12 microM for the purified ECD complex vs 233 pM for membrane-bound CGRP receptor), indicating that other regions of CLR and/or RAMP1 are important for peptide agonist binding. However, high-affinity binding to known potent and specific nonpeptide antagonists of the CGRP receptor, including olcegepant and telcagepant (K(D) < 0.02 muM), as well as N-terminally truncated peptides and peptide analogues (140 nM to 1.62 microM) was observed.

After the triptans, a calcitonin gene-related peptide blocker (telcagepant) is the first acute medicine that has been developed primarily for treatment of acute migraine. Otherwise, the new drugs have been developed first for other purposes, like anticonvulsants, antihypertensives and antidepressants used for migraine prophylaxis. For acute attacks, a new way to administer a traditional drug like dihydroergotamine is under way, and documentation of efficacy in migraine has been gained for some commonly used painkillers and anti-inflammatory drugs, and for some herbal extracts. Based on insights into the basic pathophysiological mechanisms of the disorder, some drugs have been developed which seem promising in early phase II studies (NOS inhibitors and 5HT1F-receptor agonists). In the future, development and enhancements of existing medicines must be accompanied by increased efforts to develop truly new migraine drugs based on knowledge of the pathophysiology if one wishes to reduce substantially the great burden migraine poses on patients and society.

The neuropeptide calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP) plays a key role in migraine pathophysiology. In this large phase 3 clinical trial, we sought to confirm the efficacy of telcagepant, the first orally bioavailable CGRP receptor antagonist. Adults with migraine with or without aura (International Headache Society criteria) treated a moderate or severe attack with oral telcagepant 50 mg (n = 177), 150 mg (n = 381), 300 mg (n = 371), or placebo (n = 365) in a randomized, double-blind trial. The 5 co-primary endpoints were pain freedom, pain relief, and absence of photophobia, absence of phonophobia, and absence of nausea, all at 2 hours postdose. The key secondary endpoint was 2-24 hour sustained pain freedom. The prespecified primary efficacy analyses evaluated the 150 mg and 300 mg groups; the 50-mg group was included on an exploratory basis to further characterize the dose response but was not prespecified for analysis. Tolerability was assessed by adverse experience reports. Telcagepant 300 mg was more effective (p <or= 0.001) than placebo on all primary endpoints and the key secondary endpoint, as was telcagepant 150 mg (p <or= 0.05). Telcagepant 300 mg showed a slight numeric advantage over telcagepant 150 mg on most measures. Telcagepant 50 mg values were numerically intermediate between placebo and telcagepant 150 mg and 300 mg. The percentages of patients with adverse experiences were 32.2% for telcagepant 50 mg, 32.0% for telcagepant 150 mg, 36.2% for telcagepant 300 mg, and 32.2% for placebo. This study confirmed previous findings that telcagepant 300 mg was effective at relieving pain and other migraine symptoms at 2 hours and providing sustained pain freedom up to 24 hours. In this study, telcagepant 150 mg was also effective. Telcagepant was generally well tolerated.

A highly efficient, asymmetric synthesis of telcagepant (1), a CGRP receptor antagonist for the treatment of migraine, is described. This synthesis features the first application of iminium organocatalysis on an industrial scale. The key to the success of this organocatalytic transformation was the identification of a dual acid cocatalyst system, which allowed striking a balance of the reaction efficiency and product stability effectively. As such, via an iminium species, the necessnary C-6 stereogenicity was practically established in one operation in >95% ee. Furthermore, we enlisted an unprecedented Doebner-Knoevenagel coupling, which was also via an iminium species, to efficiently construct the C3-C4 bond with desired functionality. In order to prepare telcagepant (1) in high quality, a practical new protocol was discovered to suppress the formation of desfluoro impurities formed under hydrogenation conditions to <0.2%. An efficient lactamization facilitated by t-BuCOCl followed by a dynamic epimerization-crystallization resulted in the isolation of caprolactam acetamide with the desired C3 (R) and C6 (S) configuration cleanly. Isolating only three intermediates, the overall yield of this cost-effective synthesis was up to 27%. This environmentally responsible synthesis contains all of the elements required for a manufacturing process and prepares telcagepant (1) with the high quality required for pharmaceutical use.

To evaluate whether the same or different patients respond to triptans and telcagepant. Telcagepant is an oral calcitonin gene-related peptide receptor antagonist with acute antimigraine efficacy comparable to oral triptans. It is currently unknown whether migraine patients who cannot be adequately helped with triptans might benefit from treatment with telcagepant. Post-hoc analysis of data from a randomized, controlled trial of telcagepant (150 mg, 300 mg) zolmitriptan 5 mg, or placebo for a moderate/severe migraine. Responder rates were analyzed according to patients' self-reported historical triptan response (HTR): (1) good HTR (N = 660): response in 75-100% of attacks; (2) intermediate HTR (N = 248): response in 25-74% of attacks; (3) poor HTR/no use (N = 407): response in < 25% of attacks, or patient did not take triptans. A limitation of the analysis is that the last subgroup comprised mainly (91%) patients who reported that they did not take triptans, but it was not known whether these patients were triptan-naïve or had previously used triptans and stopped taking them. For zolmitriptan, 2-hour pain relief rates were higher in the good HTR subgroup (116/162, 72%) than in the intermediate (29/62, 47%) and poor/no use (44/111, 40%) HTR subgroups. The 2-hour pain relief rates were similar across HTR subgroups for telcagepant 150 mg (48-58%), 300 mg (52-58%), and placebo (26-31%). In the poor/no use HTR subgroup, more patients receiving telcagepant 300 mg (56/98, 57.1%) had 2-hour pain relief than those receiving zolmitriptan (44/111, 39.6%; odds ratio = 2.11 [95% CI: 1.20,3.71], P = .009); the percentage for telcagepant 150 mg (57/119, 47.9%) was not significantly different from zolmitriptan (odds ratio = 1.41 [95% CI: 0.82, 2.40], P = .211). This suggests that different patients may respond to triptans or telcagepant 300 mg. Caution should be exercised in interpreting the results because of the post-hoc nature of the analysis (clinical trial registry: NCT00442936).

To determine an effective and tolerable dose of a novel oral calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP) receptor antagonist, MK-0974, for the acute treatment of migraine. Randomized, double-blind, parallel-group, clinical trial with a two-stage, adaptive, dose-ranging design. Patients were allocated to treat a moderate or severe migraine attack with MK-0974 (25, 50, 100, 200, 300, 400, or 600 mg), rizatriptan 10 mg, or placebo taken orally. The primary endpoint was pain relief (reduction to mild or none) 2 hours after dosing. Secondary endpoints included pain freedom at 2 hours and sustained pain relief at 24 hours. A prespecified, blinded, automated interim analysis was used to discontinue randomization to less effective doses. Per the adaptive study design, the four lowest MK-0974 groups (25, 50, 100, 200 mg) were discontinued due to insufficient efficacy. For the remaining treatment groups, the estimated pain relief proportions at 2 hours were 300 mg (n = 38) 68.1%, 400 mg (n = 45) 48.2%, 600 mg (n = 40) 67.5%, rizatriptan 10 mg (n = 34) 69.5%, and placebo (n = 115) 46.3%. The prespecified primary efficacy hypothesis test, which compared the average 2-hour pain relief response proportion of the combined 300, 400, and 600 mg MK-0974 groups to placebo, was significant (P = 0.015). A generally similar efficacy pattern was seen for other endpoints. MK-0974 was generally well tolerated and there did not appear to be an increase in adverse events with increasing dose. The novel, orally administered calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP) receptor antagonist, MK-0974, was effective and generally well tolerated for the acute treatment of migraine.

Migraine is a complex, neurovascular disorder in which genetic and environmental factors interact. At present, frontline therapies in the acute treatment of migraine include the use of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs and triptans. Evidence indicates that calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP) plays a fundamental role in the mechanism of migraine. CGRP is a strong vasodilatatory neuropeptide that is released from activated trigeminal sensory nerves. The development of CGRP antagonists has also been driven by the fact that triptans are vasoconstrictive and cannot be safely used in patients with cardiovascular risk factors. Olcegepant (BIBN4096) is the first CGRP antagonist for the treatment of migraine that has been tested in clinical trials, but because of its poor oral bioavailability, only the intravenous formulation has been tested. The first oral non-peptide CGRP antagonist, telcagepant, has been shown recently to be highly effective in the treatment of migraine attacks. This development can be considered as the most important pharmacological breakthrough for migraine treatment since the introduction of sumatriptan in the early 1990s. These results are also of importance, since they support an interesting pathophysiological hypothesis of migraine. The pipeline of future compounds for the treatment of acute migraine headaches include TPRV1 antagonists, prostaglandin E receptor 4 (EP(4)) receptor antagonists, serotonin 5HT1(F) receptor agonists and nitric oxide synthase inhibitors. The immediate future of a preventative treatment for migraine headaches is well represented by botulinum toxin type-A, glutamate NMDA receptor antagonists, gap-junction blocker tonabersat and an angiotensin type 1 blocker candesartan.

The calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP) receptor antagonists olcegepant and telcagepant are very potent drugs. Both are effective in migraine but in doses much higher than would be predicted from receptor binding and other in vitro results. This could perhaps suggest an effect of CGRP antagonists behind the blood-brain barrier (BBB), i.e. in the central nervous system (CNS). Comparison of doses needed for CGRP blocking effect in vitro with dose needed in vivo in man and monkeys. Discussion of these doses in relation to doses needed for anti-migraine activity. In vivo studies in monkeys and man showed that high doses compared to doses needed in vitro are needed to block capsaicin-induced in skin blood flow, a CGRP-mediated reaction. These doses are close to those needed for anti-migraine activity. The apparently high doses of CGRP receptor antagonists, olcegepant and telcagepant needed for anti-migraine effect are not so high after all. They do not allow a conclusion as to whether CGRP antagonists act on peripheral sites or central sites in migraine.

Migraine afflicts approximately 11% of the population worldwide producing substantial disability, resulting in loss of productivity both at home and at the workplace. Calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP) is closely involved in the cascade of molecular events leading to migraine painful crisis. Acute treatment of migraine is actually based on the use of triptans, class drug which presents a clear limitation due to its cardiovascular side effects. Gepants, a CGRP antagonist class, might offer a new non-vasoconstrictive approach in the acute treatment of migraine. Four chemically unrelated CGRP receptor (CGRP-R) antagonists (olcegepant, telcagepant, MK-3207 and BI 44370 TA) have displayed efficacy in the treatment of migraine. When compared with triptans, gepants class showed a similar efficacy, moreover corresponding to the best published results for oral triptans. CGRP antagonists are in different phases of their development, and the treatment of migraine could be based on the use of gepants, as class of acute medications. However, CGRP-R antagonists clinical trials seem to be discouraging for their forthcoming use in clinical practice. New CGRP-R antagonists, such as BMS-927711 and BI 44370 TA, are in the pipeline and their developments will outline the future of this drug class.

Dysregulation of the calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP), a potent vasodilator, is directly implicated in the pathogenesis of migraine. CGRP binds to and signals through the CGRP receptor (CGRP-R), a heterodimer containing the calcitonin receptor-like receptor (CLR), a class B GPCR, and RAMP1, a receptor activity-modifying protein. We have solved the crystal structure of the CLR/RAMP1 N-terminal ectodomain heterodimer, revealing how RAMPs bind to and potentially modulate the activities of the CLR GPCR subfamily. We also report the structures of CLR/RAMP1 in complex with the clinical receptor antagonists olcegepant (BIBN4096BS) and telcagepant (MK0974). Both drugs act by blocking access to the peptide-binding cleft at the interface of CLR and RAMP1. These structures illustrate, for the first time, how small molecules bind to and modulate the activity of a class B GPCR, and highlight the challenges of designing potent receptor antagonists for the treatment of migraine and other class B GPCR-related diseases.

Migraine is a debilitating headache disorder which affects approximately 12% of the general population and is the cause of significant loss of productivity (i.e., lost time from work or school) for those afflicted. The current standard of care, the 5-HT(1B/1D) agonists known as triptans, is contraindicated in patients with cardiovascular disease due to their inherent vasoconstrictive activity; thus, there is a need to develop an alternative therapy for the treatment of the disorder. This article reviews patent publications related to the use of small molecule calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP) receptor antagonists for the treatment of migraine that have appeared in the literature within the past decade. The commentary is supplemented by information presented in journal articles and focuses on the activity of several major pharmaceutical companies in the field. Two small molecule CGRP receptor antagonists, olcegepant and telcagepant, have been shown to be clinically efficacious in the treatment of migraine, and thus provide validation of this novel therapeutic mechanism.

Calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP) has a widespread distribution throughout the trigeminovascular system and other brain areas involved in migraine pathogenesis. Serum levels of CGRP are elevated during the migraine attack and return to normal with alleviation of pain. Intravenous injection of CGRP in migraineurs results in delayed headache similar to migraine. Since CGRP receptor antagonists lack direct vasoconstrictor activity, this therapeutic approach may offer advantages over the current mainstay of specific acute migraine treatment with 5-HT1B/1D receptor agonists (triptans), contra-indicated in patients with underlying cardiovascular disease. Intravenous BIBN4096BS (olcegepant) and oral MK-0974 (telcagepant), two CGRP-receptor antagonists, were safe and effective in the treatment of migraine attacks in Phase I and II trials. In a Phase III clinical trial, the efficacy of telcagepant 300 mg was comparable to that of zolmitriptan 5 mg. We intend to review the rationale for the use of CGRP-receptor antagonists, and to outline current developments and future perspectives.

Migraine is a highly prevalent neurovascular disorder that can be provoked by infusion of calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP). CGRP, a neuropeptide released from activated trigeminal sensory nerves, dilates intracranial and extracranial blood vessels and centrally modulates vascular nociception. On this basis, it has been proposed that: (i) CGRP may play an important role in the pathophysiology of migraine; and (ii) blockade of CGRP receptors may abort migraine. With the advent of potent and selective CGRP receptor antagonists, the importance of CGRP in the pathophysiology of migraine and the therapeutic principle of CGRP receptor antagonism were clearly established. Indeed, both olcegepant (BIBN4096BS, given intravenously) and telcagepant (MK-0974, given orally) have been shown to be safe, well tolerated and effective acute antimigraine agents in phase I, phase II, and for telcagepant phase III, studies. However, recent data reported elevated liver transaminases when telcagepant was dosed twice daily for three months for the prevention of migraine rather than acutely. The potential for a specific acute antimigraine drug, without producing vasoconstriction or vascular side effects and with an efficacy comparable to triptans, is enormous. The present review will discuss the role of CGRP in the pathophysiology of migraine and the various treatment modalities that are currently available to target this neuropeptide.

Two novel routes have been developed to the (3 R,6 S)-3-amino-6-(2,3-difluorophenyl)-1-(2,2,2-trifluoroethyl)azepan-2-one 2 of the CGRP receptor antagonist clinical candidate telcagepant (MK-0974, 1). The first employs a ring-closing metathesis of the styrene 7 as the key reaction, while the second makes use of a highly diastereoselective Hayashi-Miyaura Rh-catalyzed arylboronic acid addition to nitroalkene 16. The latter route has been implemented to produce multigram quantities of telcagepant for extensive preclinical evaluation.

To evaluate the efficacy and tolerability of telcagepant when co-administered with ibuprofen or acetaminophen for the acute treatment of migraine. Telcagepant is an oral calcitonin gene-related peptide receptor antagonist which is being evaluated for the acute treatment of migraine. Combining telcagepant with analgesics that have a different mechanism of action could produce greater efficacy. Randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study. Patients were randomized to treat a moderate or severe migraine headache with either telcagepant 280 mg + ibuprofen 400 mg (N = 171), telcagepant 280 mg + acetaminophen 1000 mg (N = 171), telcagepant 280 mg (N =170), or placebo (N = 171). The primary efficacy endpoint was 2-hour pain freedom. The study had approximately 88% power to detect an additive effect of at least 15 percentage points (telcagepant combination vs telcagepant monotherapy) and 48% power to detect an additive effect of at least 10 percentage points. Safety and tolerability were assessed by adverse events and laboratory tests. The percentages of patients with 2-hour pain freedom were greater in each active treatment group compared to placebo (P < .001): telcagepant + ibuprofen = 35.2%, telcagepant + acetaminophen = 38.3%, telcagepant = 31.2%, placebo = 10.9%. No significant differences were seen for either of the combination groups vs telcagepant monotherapy, but both were numerically larger than telcagepant monotherapy. All the active treatments were generally well tolerated. The percentage of patients reporting any adverse event within 48 hours was higher in the active treatment groups than placebo: telcagepant + ibuprofen = 30.3%, telcagepant + acetaminophen = 31.6%, telcagepant = 24.8%, placebo = 18.2%. The most common adverse events reported by ≥ 4 patients in one or more of the treatment groups that included telcagepant were fatigue, nausea, dizziness, somnolence, dry mouth, and tremor. The combination of telcagepant 280 mg with either ibuprofen 400 mg or acetaminophen 1000 mg did not show a statistically significant difference from telcagepant alone. Numerically greater treatment effects in the combination treatment groups over the telcagepant 280 mg monotherapy suggest that telcagepant combination treatments may merit further evaluation in studies powered to detect smaller additive benefits.

Calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP) has been implicated in the pathogenesis of migraine. Herein we describe optimization of CGRP receptor antagonists based on an earlier lead structure containing a (3R)-amino-(6S)-phenylcaprolactam core. Replacement of the phenylimidazolinone with an azabenzimidazolone gave stable derivatives with lowered serum shifts. Extensive SAR studies of the C-6 aryl moiety revealed the potency-enhancing effect of the 2,3-difluorophenyl group, and trifluoroethylation of the N-1 amide position resulted in improved oral bioavailabilities, ultimately leading to clinical candidate 38 (MK-0974).

Several lines of evidence suggest a major role of calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP) in the pathogenesis of migraine and other primary headaches. Inhibition of CGRP receptors by olcegepant and telcagepant has been successfully used to treat acute migraine and to reduce the activity of spinal trigeminal neurons involved in meningeal nociception in rodents. The site of CGRP receptor inhibition is unclear, however. In adult Wistar rats anaesthetized with isofluorane systemic intravenous infusion (0.9 mg/kg) or unilateral facial injection (1 mM in 100 microl) of capsaicin was used to induce activity in the trigeminal nociceptive system. Animals were pre-treated either by saline or olcegepant. In comparison with vehicle infusion or the non-injected side of the face, capsaicin significantly increased the expression of the activation markers Fos in the spinal trigeminal nucleus and phosphorylated extracellular signal-regulated kinase in the trigeminal ganglion. Pre-treatment with olcegepant (900 microg/kg) inhibited the capsaicin-induced expression of Fos throughout the spinal trigeminal nucleus by 57%. In contrast, the expression of phosphorylated extracellular signal-regulated kinase in the trigeminal ganglion was not changed by olcegepant pre-treatment. CGRP receptor inhibition, which has been shown to decrease spinal trigeminal activity, is likely to occur in the central nervous system rather than in the periphery including the trigeminal ganglion. This may be important for future therapeutic interventions with CGRP receptor antagonists in migraine.

The receptor for calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP) has been the target for the development of novel small molecule antagonists for the treatment of migraine. Two such antagonists, BIBN4096BS and MK-0974, have shown great promise in clinical trials and hence a deeper understanding of the mechanism of their interaction with the receptor is now required. The structure of the CGRP receptor is unusual since it is comprised of a hetero-oligomeric complex between the calcitonin receptor-like receptor (CRL) and an accessory protein (RAMP1). Both the CLR and RAMP1 components have extracellular domains which interact with each other and together form part of the peptide-binding site. It seems likely that the antagonist binding site will also be located on the extracellular domains and indeed Trp-74 of RAMP1 has been shown to form part of the binding site for BIBN4096BS. However, despite a chimeric study demonstrating the role of the N-terminal domain of CLR in antagonist binding, no specific residues have been identified. Here we carry out a mutagenic screen of the extreme N-terminal domain of CLR (residues 23-63) and identify a mutant, Met-42-Ala, which displays 48-fold lower affinity for BIBN4096BS and almost 900-fold lower affinity for MK-0974. In addition, we confirm that the Trp-74-Lys mutation at human RAMP1 reduces BIBN4096BS affinity by over 300-fold and show for the first time a similar effect for MK-0974 affinity. The data suggest that the non-peptide antagonists occupy a binding site close to the interface of the N-terminal domains of CLR and RAMP1.

Migraine is a complex neurological disorder that affects a significant proportion of the adult population worldwide. It is associated with an increase in plasma calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP) level. CGRP, a neuropeptide released from activated trigeminal sensory nerves, dilates intracranial blood vessels and transmits vascular nociception. Therefore, it is proposed that CGRP may have an important role in migraine pathophysiology and inhibition of trigeminal CGRP release or CGRP-induced cranial vasodilatation may abort migraine. The mode of action of CGRP antagonists is inhibition of neurogenic vasodilatation and inflammation, an additional neuronal action cannot be ruled out. Both intravenous applied olcegepant (BIBN 4096) and the oral telcagepant (MK-0974) were tested in clinical trials and showed clinical benefit and excellent tolerability, with recent presentation of phase III data on telcagepant suggesting that proof of concept is positive. CGRP receptor antagonists terminate migraine with efficacy similar to triptans. The results from clinical trials suggest that this new type of drug might offer advantages over existing therapies without vasoconstrictive or vascular side effects.

Calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP) receptor antagonists are a new treatment principle in acute migraine attacks. Intravenous olcegepant 2.5 mg resulted in 66% headache relief after 2 h, whereas subcutaneous sumatriptan resulted in 81-92% headache relief after 2 h. The intrinsic activity of a parenteral triptan, a 5HT(1B/1D) receptor agonist, is thus higher than the maximum effect of the parenteral CGRP receptor antagonist olcegepant. For the orally bioavailable CGRP antagonist telcagepant 300 mg, the headache relief was only 55% in one phase III study. These results indicate that CGRP receptor antagonism results in success in the acute treatment of migraine in only a certain fraction of the patients.

The sensory neuropeptide calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP) plays a role in primary headaches, and CGRP receptor antagonists are effective in migraine treatment. CGRP is a potent vasodilator, raising the possibility that antagonism of its receptor could have cardiovascular effects. We therefore investigated the effects of the antimigraine CGRP receptor antagonist telcagepant (MK-0974) [N-[(3R,6S)-6-(2,3-difluorophenyl)-2-oxo-1-(2,2,2-trifluoroethyl)azepan-3-yl]-4-(2-oxo-2,3-dihydro-1H-imidazo[4,5-b]pyridine-1-yl)piperidine-1-carboxamide] on human isolated coronary arteries. Arteries with different internal diameters were studied to assess the potential for differential effects across the coronary vascular bed. The concentration-dependent relaxation responses to human alphaCGRP were greater in distal coronary arteries (i.d. 600-1000 microm; E(max) = 83 +/- 7%) than proximal coronary arteries (i.d. 2-3 mm; E(max) = 23 +/- 9%), coronary arteries from explanted hearts (i.d. 3-5 mm; E(max) = 11 +/- 3%), and coronary arterioles (i.d. 200-300 microm; E(max) = 15 +/- 7%). Telcagepant alone did not induce contraction or relaxation of these coronary blood vessels. Pretreatment with telcagepant (10 nM to 1 microM) antagonized alphaCGRP-induced relaxation competitively in distal coronary arteries (pA(2) = 8.43 +/- 0.24) and proximal coronary arteries and coronary arterioles (1 microM telcagepant, giving pK(B) = 7.89 +/- 0.13 and 7.78 +/- 0.16, respectively). alphaCGRP significantly increased cAMP levels in distal, but not proximal, coronary arteries, and this was abolished by pretreatment with telcagepant. Immunohistochemistry revealed the expression and colocalization of the CGRP receptor elements calcitonin-like receptor and receptor activity-modifying protein 1 in the smooth muscle cells in the media layer of human coronary arteries. These findings in vitro support the cardiovascular safety of CGRP receptor antagonists and suggest that telcagepant is unlikely to induce coronary side effects under normal cardiovascular conditions.

The underlying mechanism for low oral bioavailability of MK-0974, a potent calcitonin-gene related peptide (CGRP)-receptor antagonist, in monkeys and for species-dependent non-linear pharmacokinetics in monkeys and rats were investigated. In monkeys, MK-0974 displayed moderate clearance (14-20 ml min(-1) kg(-1)), while oral bioavailability was 6%. The pharmacokinetics of MK-0974 remained linear across 0.5-10 mg kg(-1) intravenous dose in monkeys, but the oral area under the plasma concentration-time curve (AUC) increase (5-30 mg kg(-1)) was 15-fold over dose-proportional. Based on a comparison of AUC following hepatic portal vein administration and cephalic vein infusion, MK-0974 exhibited a low-to-moderate hepatic extraction ratio (36%) in monkeys. Following oral dose of [14C]MK-0974 to monkeys, the hepatic portal AUC ratio of MK-0974 versus total radioactivity was 0.32, and the total radioactivity recovered in bile and urine was 45-83%. MK-0974 undergoes significant oxidative metabolism (cytochrome P450 (CYP) 3A) in monkey intestinal microsomes. In contrast, oral AUC of MK-0974 in rats was near dose-proportional (15-100 mg kg(-1)). Following oral administration of [14C]MK-0974 to rats, the hepatic portal AUC ratio of MK-0974 to total radioactivity (0.67) was higher than in monkeys. Additionally, the metabolic rate of MK-0974 was slower in rat than in monkey intestinal microsomes. Collectively, intestinal first-pass metabolism played a significant role in the low oral bioavailability in monkeys and contributed to the species-dependent non-linear oral pharmacokinetics in rats and monkeys of MK-0974.

Calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP) is a neuropeptide that plays a key role in the pathophysiology of migraine headache. MK-0974 (telcagepant) is a potent and selective antagonist of the human and rhesus CGRP receptors and is currently in Phase III clinical studies for the acute treatment of migraine. The pharmacology of MK-0974 has been studied extensively, but there has not been a thorough characterization of its binding properties. Here, we characterize the binding of a tritiated analog of MK-0974 on human neuroblastoma (SK-N-MC) membranes and rhesus cerebellum. [(3)H]MK-0974 displayed reversible and saturable binding to both SK-N-MC membranes and rhesus cerebellum with a K(D) of 1.9 nM and 1.3 nM, respectively. Agonists and antagonists of the CGRP receptor displaced [(3)H]MK-0974 in a concentration-dependent manner in competition binding experiments. Both CGRP and adrenomedullin demonstrated biphasic competition while MK-0974 and the peptide antagonist CGRP(8-37) displaced [(3)H]MK-0974 in a monophasic fashion. In competitive binding studies with [(3)H]MK-0974 and CGRP, the fraction of high-affinity binding was reduced significantly by incubating the membranes with GTPgammaS. In kinetic binding experiments, the off-rate of [(3)H]MK-0974 was determined to be 0.51 min(-1) with a half-life of 1.3 min. In conclusion, the radioligand [(3)H]MK-0974 has proven to be a useful tool for studying the binding characteristics of MK-0974 and has broadened our understanding of this promising molecule.

Calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP) is a potent neuropeptide that plays a key role in the pathophysiology of migraine headache. CGRP levels in the cranial circulation are increased during a migraine attack, and CGRP itself has been shown to trigger migraine-like headache. The correlation between CGRP release and migraine headache points to the potential utility of CGRP receptor antagonists as novel therapeutics in the treatment of migraine. Indeed, clinical proof-of-concept in the acute treatment of migraine was demonstrated with an intravenous formulation of the CGRP receptor antagonist BIBN4096BS (olcegepant). Here we report on the pharmacological characterization of the first orally bioavailable CGRP receptor antagonist in clinical development, MK-0974 [N-[(3R,6S)-6-(2,3-difluorophenyl)-2-oxo-1-(2,2,2-trifluoroethyl)azepan-3-yl]-4-(2-oxo-2,3-dihydro-1H-imidazo[4,5-b]pyridin-1-yl)piperidine-1-carboxamide]. In vitro, MK-0974 is a potent antagonist of the human (K(i) = 0.77 nM) and rhesus (K(i) = 1.2 nM) CGRP receptors but displays >1500-fold lower affinity for the canine and rat receptors as determined via (125)I-human CGRP competition binding assays. A rhesus pharmacodynamic assay measuring capsaicin-induced changes in forearm dermal blood flow via laser Doppler imaging was utilized to determine the in vivo activity of CGRP receptor antagonism. MK-0974 produced a concentration-dependent inhibition of dermal vasodilation, generated by capsaicin-induced release of endogenous CGRP, with plasma concentrations of 127 and 994 nM required to block 50 and 90% of the blood flow increase, respectively. In conclusion, MK-0974 is a highly potent, selective, and orally bioavailable CGRP receptor antagonist, which may be valuable in the acute treatment of migraine.

MK-0974 (1a), N-[(3R,6S)-6-(2,3-difluorophenyl)-2-oxo-1-(2,2,2-trifuoroethyl)azepan-3-yl]-4-(2-oxo-2,3-dihydro-1H-imidazo-[4,5-B] pyridine-1-yl)piperidine-1-carboxamide, is a novel calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP) receptor antagonist with two chiral centers. Direct separation of its four stereoisomers (1a-d) was achieved using a cellulose chiral stationary phase, a Chiralcel OJ-RH column (150 mm x 4.6 mm), under reversed-phase condition, following the extraction of 0.2 mL plasma on Oasis muElution HLB 96-well solid-phase-extraction (SPE) plate. The tandem mass spectrometric detection was conducted in the positive-ion mode with a turbo-ion-spray (TIS) interface using multiple-reaction-monitoring on a Sciex API3000. Addition of ammonium trifluoroacetate to low-organic mobile phase improved detection sensitivity by more than 30-fold. The simultaneous quantification of the four stereoisomers in human plasma was validated over the ranges of 0.5-5000 nM for 1a and 0.5-500 nM for its three isomers (1b-d). Intraday validation, conducted with five lots of human control plasma, resulted in <12.4% (% coefficient of variation, CV) precision and 96.3-105.4% accuracy for all four stereoisomers. Further evaluation indicated that the assay was specific, the samples were stable after three freeze/thaw cycles, the recovery was reasonable (above 65%) and no matrix effect was observed for all four isomers. Investigation on the chiral integrity of 1a indicated that the diastereomer 1c, inversion at azepinone-3 carbon, was the only isomer observed in the post-dose clinical samples and accounted for 2.4-5.2% of MK-0974 exposure in the circulatory system. The possibility of inversion during blood collection, plasma storage and sample preparation was ruled out, while inversion was observed in the clinical formulation accounting for approximately 0.12% of 1a in a 100-mg capsule.

The calcitonin receptor-like receptor (CLR) associates with the accessory protein RAMP1 to form a receptor for the neuropeptide calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP). Multiple lines of evidence have implicated CGRP in the pathophysiology of migraine headache making the CGRP receptor an attractive target for development of small-molecule antagonists as a novel treatment for this debilitating condition. The CGRP receptor antagonists telcagepant and olcegepant (BIBN4096BS) have demonstrated clinical efficacy in the treatment of migraine and there is now a need to better understand how these molecules interact with the receptor. Previous work has shown the extracellular portion of RAMP1 to be important for binding of these antagonists, with tryptophan-74 being a key interaction site. The crystal structure of the extracellular portion of human RAMP1 placed tryptophan-74 in a hydrophobic patch hypothesized to interact with CGRP receptor ligands and also identified nearby residues that may be important for ligand binding. In this study we explored the role played by these residues of RAMP1 using an alanine replacement strategy. We confirmed a role for tryptophan-74 in antagonist binding and also identified arginine-67 as being important for binding of telcagepant but not compound 3, a close analog of BIBN4096BS. We also identified tryptophan-84 as being critical for both high-affinity binding of the non-peptide antagonists as well as the peptides CGRP and CGRP(8-37). These data for the first time pinpoint a specific RAMP1 residue important for both antagonist and agonist potency and are consistent with the N-terminal domain of RAMP1 forming the binding pocket interface with CLR.

* Calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP) was first described as a potent vasodilator. * CGRP is also increasingly recognized as a key player in the pathophysiology of migraine, and CGRP receptor antagonists potentially offer a new approach for treating migraine. * A novel pharmacodynamic assay to measure CGRP receptor antagonist activity non-invasively in humans has been developed, which involves measuring the increase in dermal blood flow induced by topical application of capsaicin on the forearm. * This study shows that the novel oral CGRP receptor antagonist, telcagepant, inhibits the increases in dermal blood flow induced by the topical application of capsaicin on the human forearm. * This experimental medicine model may have utility to assist in dose selection for the development of CGRP receptor antagonists. To evaluate inhibition of capsaicin-induced increase in dermal blood flow (DBF) following telcagepant (MK-0974), a potent and selective orally bioavailable calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP) receptor antagonist being developed for the acute treatment of migraine. A three-period crossover study in 12 healthy adult men. Each subject received a single oral dose of telcagepant 300 mg, telcagepant 800 mg or placebo at 0 h, followed 0.5 and 3.5 h later by two topical doses of 300 and 1000 microg capsaicin per 20 microl water-ethanol mixture. Capsaicin was applied at two sites on the volar surface of the subjects' left and right forearms. DBF was assessed by laser Doppler perfusion imaging immediately before ('baseline'), and 0.5 h after each capsaicin application at 1 and 4 h. Plasma samples to determine telcagepant concentrations were collected immediately after laser Doppler perfusion imaging. A pharmacodynamic model was developed to explore the relationship between plasma concentration and inhibition of capsaicin-induced increase in DBF. Geometric mean plasma concentrations after dosing with 300 mg and 800 mg telcagepant were 720 and 1146 nm, respectively, at 1 h, vs. 582 and 2548 nm, respectively, at 4 h. The pharmacodynamic model suggested that the EC(90) for telcagepant inhibition of capsaicin-induced increases in DBF was 909 nm. Telcagepant inhibits the increases in DBF induced by the topical application of capsaicin on the human forearm. This experimental medicine model may have utility to assist in dose selection for the development of CGRP receptor antagonists.

INTRODUCTION: Telcagepant (MK-0974) is a novel, orally active and selective CGRP receptor antagonist being investigated for acute treatment of migraine. Early clinical data suggested greater than dose proportional increases in exposure following oral administration. The aim of the present studies was to definitively characterize the oral and IV dose proportionality of telcagepant. METHODS: Healthy adult subjects were enrolled in two separate open-label randomized dose proportionality studies: 1) single oral dose crossover from 50 to 600 mg (N = 19); 2) single IV dose parallel group from 5 to 250 mg (N = 10 per dose). Blood samples were collected at time points from 0 to 48 hours postdose. RESULTS: Telcagepant was rapidly absorbed with a T(max) of approximately 1 to 2 hours after oral administration. The terminal half-life was approximately 8 to 9 hours after IV dosing and approximately 4 to 7 hours after oral dosing. Oral administration of telcagepant resulted in greater than dose proportional increases in exposure, while IV administration resulted in approximately dose proportional increases in exposure. CONCLUSIONS: Telcagepant was generally well tolerated. Oral telcagepant exhibits non-linear pharmacokinetics.

To evaluate whether the calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP) receptor antagonist telcagepant might be effective for migraine prevention. In this randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, multicenter trial (ClinicalTrials.gov NCT00797667), patients experiencing 3-14 migraine days during a 4-week baseline were randomized to telcagepant 140 mg, telcagepant 280 mg, or placebo twice daily for 12 weeks. Efficacy was assessed by mean monthly headache days and migraine/probable migraine days (headache plus ≥ 1 associated symptom). The trial was terminated following a recommendation from the Safety Monitoring Board due to hepatotoxicity concerns. At termination, the planned 660 patients had been randomized, 656 had been treated with ≥ 1 dose of study medication, and 14 had completed the trial. The mean treatment duration was 48-50 days. Thirteen patients, all in the telcagepant groups, had an alanine aminotransferase (ALT) elevation ≥ 3 × the upper limit of normal and 7 of these also had an aspartate aminotransferase elevation ≥ 3 × the upper limit of normal. Two patients had very high symptomatic transaminase elevations that occurred within 2-6 weeks of treatment initiation and resolved after treatment discontinuation. The originally planned efficacy analysis over 12 weeks was not performed due to limited data at later time points, but there was evidence that telcagepant resulted in a larger reduction from baseline than placebo for mean monthly headache days (month 1: 140 mg = -2.9, 280 mg = -3.1, placebo = -1.7; p < 0.05) and migraine/probable migraine days (month 1: 140 mg = -2.7, 280 mg = -3.0, placebo = -1.6; p < 0.05). These data suggest a potential role for CGRP receptor antagonism in migraine prophylaxis. However, the observed aminotransferase elevations do not support the use of telcagepant for daily administration. This study provides Class II evidence that in patients with migraine, telcagepant taken daily reduces headache days by 1.4 days per month compared to placebo and causes 2.5% of patients to have elevations of serum ALT levels.

In 3 randomized clinical trials (n = 1585) the calcitonin gene-related peptide antagonist telcagepant 300 mg orally had an incidence of adverse events similar to placebo when used in the acute treatment of migraine. Telcagepant, thus, has excellent tolerability in migraine. Only a quarter (26%) (334/1307) of patients were, however, pain free after 2 hours, while 56% (729/1297) of patients had pain relief at 2 hours. Telcagepant 300 mg in one randomized clinical trial was equipotent to zolmitriptan 5 mg. Based on results from a meta-analysis, rizatriptan 10 mg (41%) and almotriptan (35%) seem superior to telcagepant (26%) for pain free at 2 hours whereas rizatriptan 10 mg (25%) showed no difference from telcagepant 300 mg (19 %) for sustained pain free (2-24 hours). The introduction of calcitonin gene-related peptide receptor antagonism in the acute treatment of migraine is a major step forward but so far mostly because of its specific mode of action and excellent tolerability.

The treatment of migraine was advanced dramatically with the introduction of triptans in the early 1990s. Despite the substantial improvement in the quality of life that triptans have brought to many migraineurs, a substantial cohort of patients remain highly disabled by attacks and need new therapeutic approaches, which ideally should be quick-acting, have no vasoconstrictor activity, and have a longer duration of action and be better tolerated than current therapies. The calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP) receptor antagonists (gepants)-olcegepant (BIBN 4096 BS), telcagepant (MK-0974), MK3207, and BI 44370 TA-are effective in treating acute migraine. They have no vasoconstrictive properties, fewer adverse effects, and may act longer than triptans. Their development has been complicated by liver toxicity issues when used as preventives. Results from studies with BI 44370 TA do not support broad concern about a class effect, and further studies are ongoing in this respect. Many experimental studies and clinical trials suggest that nitric oxide may have a role in the pathophysiology of migraine. Therefore, the inhibition of nitric oxide synthase (NOS) for the acute or prophylactic treatment of migraine offered a feasible approach; as inducible NOS (iNOS) is involved in several pain states, such as inflammatory pain, it appeared to be an attractive target. However, despite high selectivity and potency, the iNOS inhibitor GW274150 was not effective for acute treatment or prophylaxis of migraine, suggesting that iNOS is very unlikely to be a promising target.

Calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP) is a neuronal messenger in intracranial sensory nerves and is considered to play a significant role in migraine pathophysiology. We investigated the effect of the CGRP receptor antagonist, telcagepant, on CGRP-induced cranial vasodilatation in human isolated cerebral and middle meningeal arteries. We also studied the expression of the CGRP receptor components in cranial arteries with immunocytochemistry. Concentration response curves to αCGRP were performed in human isolated cerebral and middle meningeal arteries in the absence or presence of telcagepant. Arterial slices were stained for RAMP1, CLR and actin in a double immunofluorescence staining. In both arteries, we found that: (i) telcagepant was devoid of any contractile or relaxant effects per se; (ii) pretreatment with telcagepant antagonised the αCGRP-induced relaxation in a competitive manner; and (iii) immunohistochemistry revealed expression and co-localisation of CLR and RAMP1 in the smooth muscle cells in the media layer of both arteries. Our findings provide morphological and functional data on the presence of CGRP receptors in cerebral and meningeal arteries, which illustrates a possible site of action of telcagepant in the treatment of migraine.

Telcagepant is a novel, orally active, and selective calcitonin gene-related peptide receptor antagonist being developed for acute treatment of migraine with and without aura. Three separate clinical studies were conducted to evaluate the pharmacokinetics and tolerability of telcagepant following single oral doses in healthy young and elderly men and women and multiple oral doses in men. Telcagepant was rapidly absorbed with a time to maximum concentration of approximately 1.5 hours. The terminal half-life was approximately 6 hours. A greater than dose-proportional increase was observed in the area under the plasma concentration versus time curve from zero to infinity. Following twice-daily dosing, with each dose separated by 2 hours, steady state was achieved in approximately 3 to 4 days with an accumulation ratio of approximately 2. There were no clinically meaningful pharmacokinetic differences when compared across age and gender. Telcagepant was generally well tolerated up to single doses of 1200 mg and multiple doses of 400 mg twice daily.

Telcagepant is an oral calcitonin-gene related peptide (CGRP) receptor antagonist that is being developed by Merck & Co Inc for the treatment of migraine. This compound blocks CGRP receptors and may block the dilation of dural vessels and reduce neurotransmission in the CNS, resulting in pain relief. Telcagepant does not cause vasoconstriction, one of the major limitations in the use of triptans, which are considered to be the standard of care for migraine. Data from phase II and III clinical trials suggest that the use of telcagepant for the acute treatment of migraine was comparable with the use of triptan compounds and was superior to placebo in all primary endpoints, including pain relief and freedom from pain at 2 h. However, recent data reported elevated transaminase levels when telcagepant was dosed daily rather than acutely. It was concluded that, if these hepatic toxicities are not observed in ongoing/future trials of the acute use of telcagepant, then this agent may offer an alternative to triptan therapy for the treatment of migraine.

Telcagepant is a calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP) receptor antagonist being evaluated for acute migraine treatment. CGRP is a potent vasodilator that is elevated after myocardial infarction, and it delays ischemia during treadmill exercise. We tested the hypothesis that CGRP receptor antagonism does not reduce treadmill exercise time (TET). The effects of supratherapeutic doses of telcagepant on TET were assessed in a double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled, two-period, crossover study in patients with stable angina and reproducible exercise-induced angina. Patients received telcagepant (600 mg, n = 46; and 900 mg, n = 14) or placebo and performed treadmill exercise at T(max) (2.5 h after the dose). The hypothesis that telcagepant does not reduce TET was supported if the lower bound of the two-sided 90% confidence interval (CI) for the mean treatment difference (telcagepant-placebo) in TET was more than -60 s. There were no significant between-treatment differences in TET (mean treatment difference: -6.90 (90% CI: -17.66, 3.86) seconds), maximum exercise heart rate, or time to 1-mm ST-segment depression using pooled data or with stratification for dose.

This study evaluated the calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP) receptor antagonist telcagepant (tablet formulation) for treatment of a migraine attack and across four attacks. Adults with migraine were randomized, double-blind, to telcagepant 140 mg, telcagepant 280 mg, or control treatment sequences to treat four moderate-to-severe migraine attacks. Control patients received placebo for three attacks and telcagepant 140 mg for one attack. Efficacy for the first attack (Attack 1) and consistency of efficacy over multiple attacks were assessed. For an individual patient, consistent efficacy was defined as ≥ 3 successes, and lack of consistent efficacy was defined as ≥ 2 failures, in treatment response. A total of 1677 patients treated ≥ 1 attack and 1263 treated all four attacks. Based on Attack 1 data, telcagepant 140 mg and 280 mg were significantly (p < .001) more effective than placebo for 2-hour pain freedom, 2-hour pain relief, 2-hour absence of migraine-associated symptoms (phonophobia, photophobia, nausea), and 2-24 hours sustained pain freedom. The percentage of patients with 2-hour pain freedom consistency and 2-hour pain relief consistency was significantly (p < .001) higher for both telcagepant treatment sequences versus control. Adverse events within 48 hours for telcagepant with an incidence ≥ 2% and twice that of placebo were somnolence (placebo = 2.3%, 140 mg = 5.9%, 280 mg = 5.7%) and vomiting (placebo = 1.4%, 140 mg = 1.0%, 280 mg = 2.9%). Telcagepant 140 mg and 280 mg were effective for treatment of a migraine attack and were more consistently effective than control for intermittent treatment of up to four migraine attacks. Telcagepant was generally well tolerated. (Clinicaltrials.gov; NCT00483704).

The primary purpose of the study was to explore the safety and tolerability of telcagepant in patients with stable coronary artery disease. Triptans are effective acute anti-migraine drugs whose vasoconstrictive effects limit their use in patients at risk for adverse cardiovascular events. Telcagepant, a calcitonin gene-related peptide receptor antagonist, is being developed for the acute treatment of migraine. Antagonism of calcitonin gene-related peptide, which does not appear to cause vasoconstriction, may allow for treatment of migraine in patients with coronary artery disease. In this randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, crossover study, patients with documented stable coronary artery disease were assigned to 1 of 2 treatment sequences: telcagepant then placebo, or placebo then telcagepant. In each treatment period, patients received 2 doses of telcagepant 300-mg or placebo 2 hours apart. They remained in the research center for 24 hours after receiving the first dose of each period, during which time continuous 12-lead ambulatory electrocardiographic (Holter) monitoring was performed. Twenty-eight patients were enrolled; all patients completed the study and were included in all analyses. Telcagepant was generally well tolerated. No laboratory or serious adverse experiences were reported, and no patient discontinued due to an adverse experience. There were no consistent treatment-related changes in laboratory, vital signs or electrocardiogram safety parameters. Three patients (2 after receiving placebo and 1 after receiving telcagepant) experienced ST segment depression during the study; none of these patients reported chest pain. Two doses of 300-mg telcagepant, administered 2 hours apart, did not appear to exacerbate spontaneous ischemia and were generally well tolerated in a small cohort of patients with stable coronary artery disease. Results of this study support further evaluation of telcagepant in patients with stable coronary artery disease.

Primary headaches such as migraine are among the most prevalent neurological disorders, affecting up to one-fifth of the adult population. The scientific work in the last decade has unraveled much of the pathophysiological background of migraine, which is now considered to be a neurovascular disorder. It has been discovered that the trigemino-cerebrovascular system plays a key role in migraine headache pathophysiology by releasing the potent vasodilator calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP). This neuropeptide is released in parallel with the pain and its concentration correlates well with the intensity of the headache. The development of drugs of the triptan class has provided relief for the acute attacks but at the cost of, mainly cardiovascular, side effects. Thus, the intention to improve treatment led to the development of small CGRP receptor antagonists such as olcegepant (BIBN4096BS) and MK-0974 that alleviate the acute migraine attack without acute side events. The purpose of this review is to give a short overview of the pathological background of migraine headache and to illustrate the mechanisms behind the actions of triptans and the promising CGRP receptor blockers.

The objective of this article is to assess the effects of sumatriptan monotherapy, telcagepant monotherapy, and their combination on blood pressure (BP) in migraine patients during a headache-free period. A double-blind, placebo-controlled, four-period, single-dose, randomized crossover study in 24 migraine patients was conducted. In each period, patients received a single oral dose of sumatriptan 100 mg alone, telcagepant 600 mg alone, sumatriptan 100 mg coadministered with telcagepant 600 mg, or placebo. Semi-recumbent BP was measured pre-dose and at seven post-dose time points over a period of six hours. Individual time-weighted averages in mean arterial pressure (MAP) were evaluated using a linear mixed-effects model. The pharmacokinetics of sumatriptan alone and in the presence of telcagepant were also evaluated using limited sampling times. The mean difference in time-weighted (0-2.5 h) MAP (90% confidence interval) was 1.2 mmHg (-0.2, 2.7) between telcagepant and placebo, 4.0 mmHg (2.5, 5.5) between sumatriptan and placebo, and 1.5 mmHg (0.0, 3.0) between telcagepant with sumatriptan vs sumatriptan alone. When coadministered with telcagepant, the AUC0-6h and C(max) of sumatriptan were increased by 23% and 24%, respectively. The small MAP increases observed after coadministration could possibly be associated with the slight elevations in sumatriptan levels. Telcagepant does not elevate mean MAP, and coadministration of telcagepant with sumatriptan results in elevations in MAP similar to those observed following administration of sumatriptan alone in migraineurs during the interictal period. When coadministered, telcagepant slightly increases the plasma levels of sumatriptan, but without an apparent clinically meaningful effect.

Studies were conducted in human isolated coronary arteries to explore the vascular effects of the calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP) receptor antagonist telcagepant and to compare its coronary vasoconstrictive potential to that of zolmitriptan. KCl precontracted coronary vessels were shown to relax to human alphaCGRP, with the CGRP-mediated vasorelaxation completely blocked with 30 microM telcagepant. In coronary vessels at basal tone, zolmitriptan caused a concentration-dependent contraction (pEC50 = 6.9 +/- 0.1; slope 0.94), with the greatest contraction obtained between 1 and 10 microM in most tissues. In contrast, telcagepant at concentrations up to 30 microM evoked no change in contractile tone. These findings suggest the potential for CGRP receptor antagonists to exert antimigraine efficacy in the absence of adverse effects on coronary tone.

Based on preclinical and clinical studies, the neuropeptide calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP) is proposed to play a central role in the underlying pathology of migraine. CGRP and its receptor are widely expressed in both the peripheral and central nervous systems by multiple cell types involved in the regulation of inflammatory and nociceptive responses. Peripheral release of CGRP from trigeminal nerve fibres within the dura and from the cell body of trigeminal ganglion neurons is likely to contribute to peripheral sensitization of trigeminal nociceptors. Similarly, the release of CGRP within the trigeminal nucleus caudalis can facilitate activation of nociceptive second-order neurons and glial cells. Thus, CGRP is involved in the development and maintenance of persistent pain, central sensitization and allodynia, events characteristic of migraine pathology. In contrast, CGRP release within the brain is likely to function in an anti-nociceptive capacity. Given the role of CGRP in migraine pathology, the potential of CGRP receptor antagonists in the treatment of migraine has been investigated. Towards this end, the non-peptide CGRP receptor antagonists olcegepant and telcagepant have been shown to be effective in the acute treatment of migraine. While telcagepant is being pursued as a frontline abortive migraine drug in a phase III clinical trial, an oral formulation of a novel CGRP receptor antagonist, BI 44370, is currently in phase II clinical trials. Encouragingly, data from clinical studies on these compounds have clearly demonstrated the potential therapeutic benefit of this class of drugs and support the future development of CGRP receptor antagonists to treat migraine and possibly other types of chronic pain.

Telcagepant (MK-0974) is a novel oral calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP) receptor antagonist and is currently under clinical development. Results from phases II and III clinical trials have suggested that telcagepant is effective for migraine treatment. A reliable and high throughput protein precipitation (PPT) method for determination of telcagepant in human plasma using liquid chromatography coupled with atmospheric pressure chemical ionization (APCI) tandem mass spectrometry has been developed. Clinical samples, internal standard (IS) and acetonitrile are transferred into 96-well plates using a robotic liquid handling system. An aliquot of 10 microL supernatant is directly injected into the LC-MS/MS system where separation is performed on a FluoPhase RP (150 x 2.1mm, 5 microm) column with an isocratic mobile phase (60% acetonitrile with 0.1% formic acid and 40% water with 0.1% formic acid) at 0.2 mL/min. The interfering 3S-diastereomer of telcagepant, which is observed in clinical samples, is chromatographically resolved from telcagepant. The PPT procedure significantly reduces the time required for sample processing and the assay is sufficiently sensitive for detection using both API 4000 and API 3000 mass spectrometers. The linear calibration range is 5-5000 nM using 200 microL of plasma. Assay intraday validation was conducted using six calibration curves derived from six lots of human control plasma. Calibration standard accuracy did not deviate by more than 3% and 6% of nominal values, and precision did not exceed 4% coefficient of variation (CV) and 10% CV, respectively on the API 4000 and API 3000. Several clinical phases IIb and III studies have been successfully supported with this assay.

The critical role of Calcitonin Gene-Related Peptide (CGRP) in migraine has been validated, with two small molecule CGRP antagonists BIBN4096BS and MK-0974 demonstrating efficacy in the reversal of acute migraine attack. Multiple approaches have been taken to find the ideal agent that most effectively inhibits CGRP's function. Here, we have summarized the progress made in recent years, including the identification and optimization of an orally bioavailable small molecule CGRP receptor antagonist. We also describe other interventions such as scavenging of CGRP itself. The advantages and disadvantages of these distinct approaches are discussed.

Endpoints used to evaluate the efficacy of acute anti-migraine drugs do not measure the tolerability. Sustained pain-free response with no adverse events has been recommended as a composite endpoint which measures the efficacy and tolerability attributes that patients desire. The aim of this study was to evaluate new composite efficacy-plus-tolerability endpoints based on a post-hoc analysis of patient-level data from a previous randomized, placebo-controlled trial of the calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP) receptor antagonist, telcagepant, and zolmitriptan in the acute treatment of migraine. Endpoints were 2-24-hour sustained pain freedom and no adverse events from 0-24 hours (SPF24NAE), 2-24 hour sustained pain relief and no adverse events from 0-24 hours (SPR24NAE), pain freedom at 2 hours and no adverse events from 0-24 hours (PF2NAE), and pain relief at 2 hours and no adverse events from 0-24 hours (PR2NAE). Compared with placebo, both telcagepant 300 mg and 150 mg achieved nominal superiority (p values <.05) for SPF24NAE, SPR24NAE, PF2NAE and PR2NAE. Zolmitriptan 5 mg showed nominal superiority versus placebo for SPF24NAE, SPR24NAE and PF2NAE, but not PR2NAE. Telcagepant 300 mg showed nominal superiority versus zolmitriptan for SPF24NAE, SPR24NA and PR2NAE. Composite efficacy-plus-tolerability endpoints may be useful for facilitating comparisons between treatments.

To evaluate the efficacy of telcagepant in patients with migraine and coronary artery disease. Calcitonin gene-related peptide receptor antagonists, such as telcagepant, may be useful for acute migraine treatment in patients with cardiovascular disease, a population for whom triptans are contraindicated. Randomized, double-blind, two-period (6 weeks per period) crossover study in patients with stable coronary artery disease and migraine. Patients were randomized 1:1 to either: (1) Period 1: telcagepant (280-mg tablet/300-mg capsule), Period 2: acetaminophen (1000-mg); or (2) Period 1: placebo for attack 1 then acetaminophen for subsequent attacks, Period 2: telcagepant. Patients could treat up to 12 migraine attacks per period to assess the tolerability of telcagepant. The primary efficacy analysis evaluated telcagepant vs placebo on 2-hour pain freedom during the first attack of Period 1. One hundred and sixty-five of the planned 400 patients were enrolled, and 114 took at least one dose of treatment. Telcagepant was not statistically different from placebo for 2-hour pain freedom (25.0% vs 18.9%, odds ratio = 1.62 [95% confidence interval: 0.62, 4.25]). The median number of attacks treated per period was 3. No cardiovascular thrombotic adverse events occurred within 14 days of dosing. The study was underpowered due to enrollment difficulties and did not demonstrate a significant efficacy difference between telcagepant and placebo for the treatment of a migraine attack in patients with stable coronary artery disease. Telcagepant was generally well tolerated for acute intermittent migraine treatment in these patients.
