OBJECTIVE The aim of this study was to describe the first case series in which an exclusive endoscopic transcanal transpromontorial approach (EETTA) was used to treat small vestibular schwannomas (VSs) and meningiomas of the internal auditory canal (IAC). METHODS The authors performed a retrospective review of patients who had undergone surgery using an EETTA to the IAC at 2 university tertiary care referral centers during the period from November 2011 to January 2015. RESULTS Ten patients underwent surgery via an EETTA for the treatment of VS in the IAC at the University Hospital of Modena or the University Hospital of Verona. The patients had Koos Grade I or II tumors and American Academy of Otolaryngology-Head and Neck Surgery (AAO-HNS) Class D hearing status preoperatively. Gross-total resection was achieved in all patients. No major complications such as cerebrospinal fluid leakage or hemorrhage were reported. In 7 of 10 (70%) patients, facial nerve function was normal immediately after surgery (Rough Grading System [RGS] Grade I). Two patients presented with a transitory facial palsy immediately after surgery (RGS Grade II-III) but experienced complete recovery during the follow-up period. The mean follow-up was 10 months. CONCLUSIONS The EETTA proved to be successful for the removal of VS or meningioma involving the cochlea, fundus, and IAC, with possible lower complication rates and less invasive procedures than those for traditional microscopic approaches. The potential for the extensive and routine use of this approach in lateral and posterior skull base surgery will depend on the development of technology and surgical refinements and on the diffusion of skull base endoscopic skills among the otolaryngological and neurosurgical communities.

To evaluate short- and mid-term level of imbalance after vestibular schwannoma (VS) microsurgery by the transpetrosal approach, to search for factors predictive of vestibular compensation, and to determine which patient categories need a postoperative vestibular rehabilitation program. Prospective cohort study at a tertiary referral center. Between 2010 and 2011, patients aged 18 to 75 operated on for VS by transpetrosal approaches were included. VS was characterized by its size (Koos classification) and the presence or not of a cystic component. Hearing was classified according to the Gardner Robertson grading. The preoperative workup included an audiogram, computerized video nystagmography (VNG) with caloric testing, gaze study, rotatory tests, click-evoked cervical vestibular evoked myogenic potential measurements (cVEMPs), and subjective visual vertical test. Patients were asked to complete a Dizziness Handicap Inventory (DHI). Postoperatively, patients were reevaluated on D7 (clinical status), D90 (VNG and DHI), and D180 (DHI). Timing and duration of vestibular rehabilitation were also recorded. Forty-eight patients were included. Preoperatively, 77% experienced mild instability problems with a mean DHI score of 14.1 (range 4-32). Postoperatively, 71% reported stable or even improved perceived stability. Mean DHI scores were 28.1 on D90 and 19.8 on D180. Serviceable hearing, cystic transformation, normal cVEMPs, diplopia, and vestibular syndrome on D7 were found to be predictive of worse equilibrium outcome than when absent. A preoperative caloric deficit greater than 75% seemed to be a good prognostic factor. Vestibular rehabilitation was conducted in 56% of patients. Starting it early (<1 mo) seemed to be beneficial for final equilibrium outcome. VS microsurgery provides good stability results. Some preoperative parameters may be predictive of worse or improved balance recovery, as is clinical status on D7.

Gamma Knife radiosurgery (GKRS) is commonly used in treating small vestibular schwannomas; however, its use for larger vestibular schwannomas is still controversial. To assess the long-term safety and efficacy of treating eligible Koos grade 4 vestibular schwannomas with GKRS. We conducted a single-center, retrospective evaluation of patient undergoing GKRS for Koos grade 4 vestibular schwannomas. We evaluated clinical, imaging, and treatment characteristics and assessed treatment outcome. Inclusion criteria were tumor size of ≥4 cm and follow-up of at least 6 months. Patients with neurofibromatosis type 2 were excluded. Primary outcomes measured were tumor control rate, hearing and facial function preservation rate, and complications. All possible factors were analyzed to assess clinical significance. Sixty-eight patients met inclusion criteria. Median follow-up was 47 months (range, 6-125 months). Baseline hearing was serviceable in 60%. Median tumor volume at radiosurgery was 7.4 cm (range, 4-19 cm). The median marginal dose used was 12 Gy at the 50% isodose line. Actuarial tumor control rates were 95% and 92% at 2 and 10 years, respectively. Actuarial serviceable hearing preservation rates were 89% and 49% at 2 and 5 years, respectively. Facial nerve preservation was 100%. Clinical complications included balance disturbance (11%), facial pain (10%), facial numbness (5%), and tinnitus (10%). Most complications were mild and transient. Hydrocephalus occurred in 3 patients, requiring ventriculoperitoneal shunt insertion. Larger tumor size was significantly associated with persisting symptoms post-treatment. Patients with Koos grade 4 vestibular schwannomas and minimal symptoms can be treated safely and effectively with GKRS.

Facial nerve preservation surgery for large vestibular schwannomas is a novel strategy for maintaining normal nerve function by allowing residual tumor adherent to this nerve or root-entry zone. To report, in a retrospective study, outcomes for large Koos grade 3 and 4 vestibular schwannomas. After surgical treatment for vestibular schwannomas in 52 patients (2004-2013), outcomes included extent of resection, postoperative hearing, and facial nerve function. Extent of resection defined as gross total, near total, or subtotal were 7 (39%), 3 (17%), and 8 (44%) in 18 patients after retrosigmoid approaches, respectively, and 10 (29.5%), 9 (26.5%), and 15 (44%) for 34 patients after translabyrinthine approaches, respectively. Hearing was preserved in 1 (20%) of 5 gross total, 0 of 2 near-total, and 1 (33%) of 3 subtotal resections. Good long-term facial nerve function (House-Brackmann grades of I and II) was achieved in 16 of 17 gross total (94%), 11 of 12 near-total (92%), and 21 of 23 subtotal (91%) resections. Long-term tumor control was 100% for gross total, 92% for near-total, and 83% for subtotal resections. Postoperative radiation therapy was delivered to 9 subtotal resection patients and 1 near-total resection patient. Follow-up averaged 33 months. Our findings support facial nerve preservation surgery in becoming the new standard for acoustic neuroma treatment. Maximizing resection and close postoperative radiographic follow-up enable early identification of tumors that will progress to radiosurgical treatment. This sequential approach can lead to combined optimal facial nerve function and effective tumor control rates.

The debate continues with a limited number of publications describing outcomes in patients with vestibular schwannoma (VS) treated with planned subtotal resection (STR) plus stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS). Here we present our experience. This is a retrospective review of 22 patients with VS Koos grade III and IV who were treated with STR followed by SRS. Tumor volumes, facial nerve function, hearing preservation, and the presence of trigeminal neuropathy were noted. Spearman's rank test was used to correlate facial nerve grade with postoperative tumor residual tumor volume. Tumor control was achieved in all patients with a mean follow-up of 28 months. No patient required other treatment beyond the original surgery and adjuvant SRS during this period. After a mean postoperative period of 28 months, 19/22 patients had excellent (House-Brackmann I or II) facial nerve function grading. Improved facial nerve function was positively correlated with larger residual tumor volume (rs = 0.63). Kaplan-Meier curve showed around 80% probability for regaining facial nerve function after initial deterioration. Four patients reported postoperative facial numbness at the side of surgery, with 3 cases showing improvement within a month. Temporary postoperative caudal cranial nerve dysfunction was observed in 2 patients. Hybrid strategy of STR and adjuvant SRS provides patients with large VS excellent tumor control and a good clinical outcome.

To evaluate the results of facial nerve (FN) grafting using great auricular cable graft and fibrin glue without suturing to palliate FN disruption after removal of large cerebellopontine angle (CPA) vestibular schwannoma (VS) or facial nerve schwannoma (FNS). To assess whether tumor size and origin influenced the results. Retrospective review of all patients having undergone removal of FNS/VS and needing intraoperative FN repair between 2001 and 2011. FN was rehabilitated using great auricular nerve cable graft and fibrin glue (Tisseal) without stitching suture. All data recorded were reviewed to access age, sex, tumor type, and tumor size according to the Koos classification and presenting symptoms. FN function was evaluated preoperatively and at 18 months using the House-Brackmann (HB) grading system. Among the 595 patients operated for CPA schwannomas in this period, 15 patients (2.5%) underwent FN repair, including 7 cases of FNS and 8 cases of VS. Tumor removal was total in all cases. FN recovery was HB3 in 13 cases (86.7%) and HB4 in 2. The mean time to the first clinical signs of facial reinnervation was 10 months (6-12 mo). No significant relation was found between postoperative facial function and tumor size or type, even if all cases of preoperative FP were noted in FNS. Immediate FN reconstruction with fibrin glue-aided greater auricular nerve graft can effectively restore FN function with excellent outcomes. The results seem better than those observed by other authors using sutured grafts or delayed hypoglossal-facial nerve anastomosis.

One of the primary criticismes of vestibular schwannoma (VS) radiosurgery is that the risk of surgical morbidity is increased for patients whose tumor progresses after the procedures. We reviewed the French experience of operated patients after failed Gamma Knife radiosurgery. From July 1992 to January 2002, 25 out of the 1000 treated patients underwent another treatment procedure for a gamma knife failure. Excluding the NF2 patients, 21 patients have been operated and the present study shows the data collected for 20 of them. In order to analyze the difficulties observed during the surgery, a questionnaire was filled by the surgeons. The mean interval between radiosurgery and removal was 36 Months, from 10 to 83 Months. The mean increase in Volume was 559% (37 to 3036%, median 160%). Evolution of the Koos grading was found from 8 grade II, 10 grade III et 2 grade IV to 10 grade III and 10 grade IV. Patients have been operated for radiological tumor growth in 7 cases and for clinico-radiological evolution in 13 cases. In 9 cases, the surgeon considered that he had to face unusual difficulties mainly because of adhesion of the tumor to neurovascular structures. Tumor removal was total in 14 cases, near total in 4 cases and subtotal in 2 cases. One case of venous infarction was noticed at the second day following surgery responsible of hemiparesis and aphasia that gradually recovered. At last follow-up examination, facial nerve was normal (House and Brackmann grade I and II) in 10 cases while it was a grade III in 7 cases and grade IV and V in 3 cases. We recommend that the decision for surgical removal of growing vestibular schwannoma after Gamma Knife treatment should be done after a sufficiently long follow-up period. Our results show that the quality of removal and of facial nerve preservation might be impaired by radiosurgery in half of cases. However these results do not support a change in our policy of radiosurgical treatment of small to medium size vestibular schwannoma.

To evaluate and compare outcomes for patients with vestibular schwannoma (VS) treated in a single institution with linac-based stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS) or by fractionated stereotactic radiotherapy (SRT). One hundred and nineteen patients (SRS = 78, SRT = 41) were treated. For both SRS and SRT, beam shaping is performed by a mini-multileaf collimator. For SRS, a median single dose of 12.5 Gy (range, 11-14 Gy), prescribed to the 80% isodose line encompassing the target, was applied. Of the 42 SRT treatments, 32 treatments consisted of 10 fractions of 3-4 Gy, and 10 patients received 25 sessions of 2 Gy, prescribed to the 100% with the 95% isodose line encompassing the planning target volume. Mean largest tumor diameter was 16.6 mm in the SRS and 24.6 mm in the SRT group. Local tumor control, cranial nerve toxicity, and preservation of useful hearing were recorded. Any new treatment-induced cranial nerve neuropathy was scored as a complication. Median follow-up was 62 months (range, 6-136 months), 5 patients progressed, resulting in an overall 5-year local tumor control of 95%. The overall 5-year facial nerve preservation probability was 88% and facial nerve neuropathy was statistically significantly higher after SRS, after prior surgery, for larger tumors, and in Koos Grade ≥3. The overall 5-year trigeminal nerve preservation probability was 96%, not significantly influenced by any of the risk factors. The overall 4-year probability of preservation of useful hearing (Gardner-Robertson score 1 or 2) was 68%, not significantly different between SRS or SRT (59% vs. 82%, p = 0.089, log rank). Linac-based RT results in good local control and acceptable clinical outcome in small to medium-sized vestibular schwannomas (VSs). Radiosurgery for large VSs (Koos Grade ≥3) remains a challenge because of increased facial nerve neuropathy.

Patients with vestibular schwannomas (VS) are either assigned to watchful waiting, microsurgical resection, or radiosurgery. Decision making on how to proceed is based on parameters such as age, tumor growth, loss of hearing, and the tumor's Koos grading. In order to correlate Koos grading with tumor volume, patient records of 235 patients with VS who underwent Gamma Knife radiosurgery (GKRS) were retrospectively reviewed. From 1994 to 2009, 235 consecutive patients underwent GKRS for sporadic VS at the Zurich Gamma Knife Center. Median follow up was 62.8 ± 33.0 months. Of the 235 tumors, 32 (13.6 %) were graded Koos I with a volume of 0.25 ± 0.3 cc; 71 (30.2 %) were graded Koos II with a volume of 0.57 ± 0.54 cc; 70 (29.8 %) were graded Koos III with a volume of 1.82 ± 1.88 cc; and 62 (26.4 %) were graded Koos IV with a volume of 4.17 ± 2.75 cc. Tumor progression was defined as a volume increase > 20 % at 2 years or later following GKRS. Overall tumor progression occurred in 21/235 (8.9 %) patients at 3.4 ± 0.9 years. Tumor progression did not differ statistically significantly in the various Koos grades: 1/32 (3.1 %) patients with VS Koos Grade I, 7/71 (9.8 %) patients with VS Koos Grade II, 6/70 (8.6 %) patients with VS Koos Grade III, and 7/62 (11.3 %) patients with VS Koos Grade IV. To our knowledge, this is the first work correlating the various Koos grades of VS to their respective tumor volumes. In our patients, tumor volumes of VS Koos Grade IV were limited because all of our patients were eligible for radiosurgery. In our series, the outcome following GKRS for patients with VS Koos Grade IV tumors did not differ from patients with VS Koos Grades I-III. We therefore suggest to limit Koos Grade IV VS to tumor volumes < 6 cc that may be eligible for radiosurgery, and introduce an additional VS Grade V for large VS with tumor volumes of > 6 cc that may not be eligible for radiosurgery.

The membranous structure of vestibular schwannoma is an important factor in its surgical treatment. Herein, we report intraoperative and microscopic findings relating to an outermost dura-like membrane in cases of vestibular schwannoma and the importance of these findings. Intraoperative findings of 16 cases of vestibular schwannoma treated with an initial surgery were studied with an aim to determine if the cases had a dura-like membrane. Then we studied microscopic findings of the dura-like membrane using hematoxylin and eosin, Masson trichrome, and immunohistochemical staining in 2 cases. The dura-like membrane was observed in 8 out of 16 cases. The average tumor size of the cases that had a dura-like membrane was 30 ± 8.1 mm, and Koos grading 4 was in 7 out of 8 cases, and one was grade 3. In cases without a dura-like membrane, these values were significantly smaller, with an average tumor size of 12.8 ± 5.2 mm, and Koos grading 4 was only in 1 of 8 cases, grade 3 was in 2 cases, and other 5 cases were grade 2. The outermost dura-like membrane enveloped the vestibular schwannoma around the internal acoustic meatus and was continuous with the dura mater. Reactive angiogenesis was observed in the dura mater. Microscopic findings proved its continuity with the dura mater. In one case, the facial nerve was damaged before it was identified during subcapsular dissection. In that case, the dura-like membrane negatively affected our ability to identify the facial nerve. A dura-like membrane sometimes envelops vestibular schwannoma around the internal acoustic meatus. Recognition of this membranous structure is important for the surgical preservation of facial and acoustic nerves.

The aim of this study was to analyze complications of vestibular schwannoma (VS) microsurgery. A retrospective study was performed in 333 patients with unilateral vestibular schwannoma indicated for surgical treatment between January 1997 and December 2012. Postoperative complications were assessed immediately after VS surgery as well as during outpatient followup. In all 333 patients microsurgical vestibular schwannoma (Koos grade 1: 12, grade 2: 34, grade 3: 62, and grade 4: 225) removal was performed. The main neurological complication was facial nerve dysfunction. The intermediate and poor function (HB III-VI) was observed in 124 cases (45%) immediately after surgery and in 104 cases (33%) on the last followup. We encountered disordered vestibular compensation in 13%, permanent trigeminal nerve dysfunction in 1%, and transient lower cranial nerves (IX-XI) deficit in 6%. Nonneurological complications included CSF leakage in 63% (lateral/medial variant: 99/1%), headache in 9%, and intracerebral hemorrhage in 5%. We did not encounter any case of meningitis. Our study demonstrates that despite the benefits of advanced high-tech equipment, refined microsurgical instruments, and highly developed neuroimaging technologies, there are still various and significant complications associated with vestibular schwannomas microsurgery.
