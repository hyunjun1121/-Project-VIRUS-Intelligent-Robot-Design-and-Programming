To determine long-term efficacy and safety of epilepsy surgery in children and adolescents with malformations of cortical development (MCD) and to identify differences in seizure outcome of the various MCD subgroups. Special focus was set on the newly introduced International League Against Epilepsy (ILAE) classification of focal cortical dysplasia (FCD). This is a single center retrospective cross-sectional analysis of prospectively collected data. age at surgery <18 years, pre-surgical evaluation and epilepsy surgery performed at the Vienna pediatric epilepsy center, histologically proven MCD, complete follow-up data for at least 12 months. Clinical variables evaluated: type and localization of MCD, type of surgery and a variety of clinical characteristics reported to be associated with (un-)favorable outcomes. MCD were classified following the existing classification schemes (Barkovich et al., 2012. Brain. 135, 1348-1369; Palmini et al., 2004. Neurology. 62, S2-S8) and the ILAE classification for FCD recently proposed by Blümcke in 2011. Seizure outcome was classified using the ILAE classification proposed by Wieser in 2001. 60 Patients (51.7% male) were included. Follow up was up to 14 (mean 4.4 ± 3.2) years. Mean age at surgery was 8.0 ± 6.0 (median 6.0) years; mean age at epilepsy onset was 2.9 ± 3.2 (median 2.0) years; duration of epilepsy before surgery was 4.8 ± 4.4 (median 3.0) years. 80% of the patients were seizure free at last follow-up. AEDs were successfully withdrawn in 56.7% of all patients. Extended surgery, lesion localization in the temporal lobes and absence of inter-ictal spikes in postsurgical EEG recordings were predictive of favorable seizure outcomes after surgery. However, no association was found between outcome and MCD sub-types. Epilepsy surgery is highly effective in carefully selected drug-resistant children with MCD. Surrogate markers for complete resection of the epileptogenic zone remain the only significant predictors for seizure freedom after surgery.

The purpose of this study is to determine the sensibility of each imaging tool in identifying focal cortical dysplasia (FCD) in children and adolescents with epilepsy and to define the prognostic factors of pediatric and adolescent epilepsy surgery. We identified 48 children with FCD who underwent resective surgery and analyzed their preoperative data. The results of various anatomic and functional neuroimaging studies were compared for accuracy in locating the lesion. We also investigated clinical factors that affected the outcome of surgical treatment. Brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) was able to localize FCD in 30 patients and fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography (FDG-PET) and/or subtraction ictal single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) coregistered with MRI provided additional information that helped to define the lesion in 13 patients. When comparing the pathologic results between a mild malformation of cortical development (MCD) and FCD type I and II, we noted a strong tendency for patients with FCD to have MRI abnormalities (p = 0.005). In addition, severe pathologic features (Palmini's classification, FCD type II) (p = 0.025) showed significant correlation with a better surgical outcome. To define the primary epileptogenic area, various interictal epileptiform discharges and the results of multimodal neuroimaging studies were helpful, and younger age at the time of operation could aid in more favorable surgical outcomes (p = 0.048). Our study showed a significant relationship between pathologic grade and the detectability of FCD by brain MRI. In addition, early surgery can be justified by showing that advanced neuroimaging studies in children with FCD and even with extensive epileptiform discharges have a higher rate of success.

For dozens of years, a variety of pathological findings have been revealed through previous observations on surgically resected lesions from patients with intractable epilepsy, including excessive number of neurons in the molecular layer of cortices, unexpected existence of white matter neurons, and persistent columnar structure. These findings have sometimes been referred to as microdysgenesis (MD) or mild malformation of cortical development (mMCD), which is defined as microscopic abnormalities of brain formations with no macroscopical and neuroradiological findings. Taylor et al. (1971) described surgical cases with giant neurons and bizarre, grotesque cells as "focal dysplasia of the cerebral cortices with epilepsy." Since 1997, such malformations have subsequently been referred to as focal cortical dysplasia (FCD), in Greenfield's Neuropathology. Since early 2000, the definition of FCD has gradually been given a broader interpretation than the case described by Taylor et al., as shown in Palmini's classification (2004) or the newest classification (2011) proposed by the Neuropathology Task Force of the International League Against Epilepsy (ILAE). The ILAE classification describes 3 types of disease: Type I, Type II, and Type III. Type I is equivalent to some, but not all, pathological phenotypes of MD or mMCD. Type II is Taylor's FCD alone. Type III, which was not included in Palmini's classification, merges brain malformation and other pathological findings. However, the reproducibility of pathological diagnosis by using the ILAE classification was low, except for Type IIb. Hence, future studies are necessary to provide further reliable criteria for the pathological diagnosis of epilepsy patients.

Focal cortical dysplasias are a well-recognized cause of medically intractable seizures. The clinical relevance of certain subgroups of the International League Against Epilepsy (ILAE) classification scheme remains to be determined. The aim of the present work is to assess the effect of the focal cortical dysplasia type Ib and Ic histologic subtypes on surgical outcome with respect to seizure frequency. This study also provides an opportunity to compare the predictive value of the ILAE and Palmini et al classification schemes with regard to the type I focal cortical dysplasias. We retrospectively reviewed 91 focal cortical dysplasia patients (55% female; median age: 19 years (interquartile range 8-34); median seizure duration: 108 months (interquartile range 36-204)) with chronic epilepsy who underwent surgery. We compared the pathological subtypes, evaluating the patients' post-surgical outcome with respect to seizure frequency according to the Engel's classification and the ILAE outcome classification. Both the ILAE classification scheme and Palmini et al classification scheme were utilized to classify the histologic subtype. Using χ(2) and Fisher's exact tests, we compared the post-surgical outcomes among these groups. Of the 91 patients, there were 50 patients with ILAE focal cortical dysplasia type Ib, 41 with ILAE focal cortical dysplasia type Ic, 63 with Palmini et al focal cortical dysplasia type IA, and 28 with Palmini et al focal cortical dysplasia type IB. After surgery, 44 patients (48%) were seizure-free. Crude analysis revealed no significant difference between patients with subtypes of ILAE focal cortical dysplasia type I or Palmini et al focal cortical dysplasia type I concerning postoperative outcome according to the Engel and ILAE scoring systems on seizure frequency. Our findings revealed no significant difference concerning surgical outcome with respect to seizure frequency for the histologic subtypes of ILAE focal cortical dysplasia type I (Ib vs Ic) or Palmini et al focal cortical dysplasia type I (IA vs IB). In isolation, the histologic subtype of focal cortical dysplasia type I does not appear predictive of postoperative outcome.

To investigate the clinicopathologic features of focal cortical dysplasia (FCD) in patients with refractory epilepsy. The clinical, radiologic and pathologic features of 38 cases of FCD receiving surgical treatment in 2005 were reviewed retrospectively. The mean age of disease onset was 9.2 years. The disease lasted for 11.9 years on average and often presented as complex partial seizure. Radiologic examination revealed hippocampal sclerosis, or abnormal signals in the grey matter in 21 cases. According to Palmini's classification system, the following pathologic subgroups were identified: FCD type IA (3/38), FCD type IB (20/38), FCD type IIA (5/38) and FCD type IIB (5/38). The remaining 5 cases were classified as mild cortical dysplasia. Topographically, FCD type II was often seen in the extratemporal region (8/10), predominantly in the frontal lobe (5/8). Dual pathology was identified only in cases with FCD type IB. Immunohistochemical study showed that the giant neurons, immature neurons and dysmorphic neurons were strongly positive for NeuN. A small number of balloon cells expressed nestin. FCD is a common cause of refractory epilepsy. FCD type IB is the predominant pathologic subtype. Associated hippocampal sclerosis is sometimes seen. Clinicopathologic differences between FCD type I and FCD type II are observed.

An International League Against Epilepsy (ILAE) consensus classification system for focal cortical dysplasias (FCDs) has been published in 2011 specifying clinicopathologic FCD variants. The aim of the present work was to microscopically assess interobserver agreement and intraobserver reproducibility for FCD categories among an international group of neuropathologists with different levels of experience and access to epilepsy surgery tissue. Surgical FCD specimens covering a broad histopathology spectrum were retrieved from 22 patients with epilepsy. Three surgical nonepilepsy specimens served as controls. A total of 188 slides with routine or immunohistochemical stainings were digitalized with a slide scanner to allow Internet-based microscopy review. Nine experienced neuropathologists were invited to review these cases twice at a time gap of 3 months and different orders of case presentation. The 2011 ILAE FCD consensus classification served as instruction. Kappa analysis was calculated to estimate interobserver and intraobserver agreement levels. In a third evaluation round, 21 additional neuropathologists with different experience and access to epilepsy surgery reviewed the same case series. Interobserver agreement was good (κ = 0.6360), with 84% consensus of diagnoses during the first evaluation (21 of 25 cases). Kappa values increased to 0.6532 after reevaluation, and consensus was obtained in 24 (96%) of 25 cases. Overall intraobserver reproducibility was also good (κ = 0.7824, ranging from 0.4991 to 1.000). Fewest changes in the classification were made in the FCD type II group (2.2% of 225 original diagnoses), whereas the majority of changes occurred in FCD type III (13.7% of 225 original diagnoses). In the third evaluation round, interobserver agreement was reflected by the level of experience of each neuropathologist, with κ values ranging from moderate (0.5056; high level of experience >40 cases/year) to low (0.3265; low level of experience <10 cases/year). Our study achieved a good and reliable interobserver agreement among the group of expert neuropathologists originally involved in the ILAE FCD consensus classification system. Intraobserver reproducibility in this group was even more robust. These results showed considerable improvement compared to a previous study evaluating the 2004 Palmini FCD classification. Agreement levels were lower in our second group of neuropathologists and were related to their level of access and experience with epilepsy surgery specimens. These results suggested that the more precise ILAE definition of FCD histopathology patterns improves operational procedures in the diagnosis of FCDs. On the other hand, microscopic assessment of FCD is a challenge and requires sustained experience and teaching. The virtual slide review system allowed testing of this hypothesis and reached a widespread group of participating colleagues from different centers all over the world. We propose to further use this tool as a teaching device and also to address other epilepsy-associated entities still difficult to classify such as hippocampal sclerosis, long-term epilepsy-associated tumors, or mild malformations of cortical development (mMCDs), which were not yet covered by current ILAE classification systems.

Focal cortical dysplasias (FCD) are a well-recognized cause of medically intractable epilepsy. They are defined as malformations of cortical development and are marked by abnormalities of cortical layering and neuronal differentiation and maturation. A number of classification approaches have been devised over the last four decades, indicating controversies surrounding issues of recognition, definition, and philosophical approach. More recent attempts have attempted to correlate morphologic phenotype with clinical or developmental parameters in order to provide a clinical relevance. This short review provides an overview of the issues which account for the varied historical approaches to FCD classification and descriptions of gross pathologic findings associated with FCD and an overview of two more recently developed and widely used schema, the Palmini et al. (Neurology 62: S2-8, 2004) and the International League Against Epilepsy (ILAE) classifications Blumcke et al. Epilepsia 52: 158-174, 2011. The pathologic features of these two approaches will be reviewed and compared, including discussion of their limitations.

The study analyzes the occurrence of high frequency oscillations in different types of focal cortical dysplasia in 22 patients with refractory epilepsy. High frequency oscillations are biomarkers for epileptic tissue, but it is unknown whether they can reflect increasingly dysplastic tissue changes as well as epileptic disease activity. High frequency oscillations (80-450 Hz) were visually marked by two independent reviewers in all channels of intracranial implanted grid, strips, and depth electrodes in patients with focal cortical dysplasia and refractory epilepsy. Rates of high frequency oscillations in patients with pathologically confirmed focal cortical dysplasia of Palmini type 1a and b were compared with those in type 2a and b. Patients with focal cortical dysplasia type 2 had significantly more seizures than those with type 1 (p < 0.001). Rates of high frequency oscillations were significantly higher in patients with focal cortical dysplasia type 2 versus type 1 (p < 0.001). In addition, it could be confirmed that rates of high frequency oscillations were significantly higher in presumed epileptogenic areas than outside (p < 0.001). Activity of high frequency oscillations mirrors the higher epileptogenicity of focal cortical dysplasia type 2 lesions compared to type 1 lesions. Therefore, rates of high frequency oscillations can reflect disease activity of a lesion. This has implications for the use of high frequency oscillations as biomarkers for epileptogenic areas, because a detailed analysis of their rates may be necessary to use high frequency oscillations as a predictive tool in epilepsy surgery.

Meningioangiomatosis is a rare, benign, developmental, or hamartomatous lesion which may involve the leptomeninges and underlying brain parenchyma. Histologically, meningioangiomatosis is marked by a proliferation of blood vessels in the parenchyma, rimmed by collars of spindled meningothelial cells. There are anecdotal reports of an association of meningioangiomatosis with focal cortical dysplasia. We retrospectively analyzed the clinical, histopathologic, and treatment outcomes of 16 patients with a diagnosis of meningioangiomatosis, specifically investigating these cases for evidence of adjacent focal cortical dysplasia. Patients ranged in age from 1 to 34 years (median 18), 12 of whom had medically-intractable epilepsy as their presenting symptom. No patients in this study had a confirmed diagnosis of neurofibromatosis type II. Four patients (25%) were found to have fibrous meningiomas associated with the meningioangiomatosis. Ten of the 12 patients (83%) who had adequate tissue excised adjacent to the meningioangiomatosis demonstrated evidence of focal cortical dysplasia, with 6 of those (60%) classified as Palmini type IA, and 4 patients (40%) classified as Palmini type IIA. Seven of the patients (44%) had no post-operative seizures, and were off anti-epileptic drugs, while 2 patients relapsed, and required pharmacologic treatment for seizure control. This study therefore presents evidence to support inclusion of meningioangiomatosis as a focal cortical dysplasia-associated entity, as suggested by the ILAE classification (type IIIc). As focal cortical dysplasia is a developmental malformation, its association with meningioangiomatosis supports a developmental etiology of sporadic meningioangiomatosis.

Tuberous sclerosis complex (TSC) and severe cortical dysplasia (CD), or CD type II according to Palmini classification, share histopathologic similarities, specifically the presence of cytomegalic neurons and balloon cells. In this study we examined the morphologic and electrophysiologic properties of cells in cortical tissue samples from pediatric patients with TSC and CD type II who underwent surgery for pharmacoresistant epilepsy. Normal-appearing pyramidal neurons from TSC and CD type II cases had similar passive membrane properties. However, the frequency of excitatory postsynaptic currents (EPSCs) was higher in neurons from TSC compared to severe CD cases, particularly the frequency of medium- and large-amplitude synaptic events. In addition, EPSCs rise and decay times were slower in normal cells from TSC compared to severe CD cases. Balloon cells were found more frequently in TSC cases, whereas cytomegalic pyramidal neurons occurred more often in CD type II cases. Both cell types were similar morphologically and electrophysiologically in TSC and severe CD. These results suggest that even though the histopathology in TSC and severe CD is similar, there are subtle differences in spontaneous synaptic activity and topographic distribution of abnormal cells. These differences may contribute to variable mechanisms of epileptogenesis in patients with TSC compared with CD type II.

The new International League Against Epilepsy (ILAE) classification for focal cortical dysplasia (FCD) differentiates between patients with isolated FCD (type 1) and FCD with an associated hippocampal sclerosis (HS) (type 3a). In contrast to the former FCD classification by Palmini, which considered only histologic features, the novel ILAE classification also relies on magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) findings and presumed pathogenesis. We investigated in a cohort of 100 patients with exclusively temporal FCD if the new subdivision of FCD is reflected in clinical characteristics. Thirty-one patients with FCD type 1 and 50 patients with FCD type 3a in the temporal lobe were included. In all patients MRI and histology of the FCD were available. Both patient groups were compared to 19 patients with temporal FCD type 2 with clearly different histologic appearance. Patients with FCD type 1 and type 3a presented with similar clinical features in many respects. In univariate analyses, no statistically significant differences were found as to age at epilepsy onset (p = 0.07) and epilepsy surgery (p = 0.14), a normal appearing neocortical temporal lobe (p = 0.08) or diagnosis of FCD by visual inspection of MRI (p = 0.08), preoperative seizure frequency (p = 0.06), and the predominance of an epigastric aura (p = 0.08). The postoperative outcome was nearly identical 1 year (p = 0.8) and 2 (p = 0.8), 3 (p = 0.8), 5 (p = 0.7), and 8 (p = 1.0) years postoperatively. Only febrile seizures (p = 0.025) and an aura (p = 0.03) were significantly more frequently reported in patients with FCD type 3a. Similar results were obtained from a multivariate logistic regression analysis. Patients with FCD type 2 were more different: Compared to FCD type 3a, age at epilepsy surgery was significantly lower (p = 0.004) and auras (p = 0.005) were significantly less frequently reported. Epigastric auras (p = 0.04) and febrile seizures (p = 0.025) occurred significantly less frequently in patients with FCD type 2 without HS compared to FCD type 3a. The diagnosis of an FCD was significantly more frequently made (p = 0.03) by visual inspection of the MRI compared to FCD type 1. Clinical features did not allow to clear separation of temporal FCD types 1 and 3a. Statistically significant differences were seen in a history of febrile seizures and the occurrence of auras more common in FCD type 3a. However, FCD type 2 in the same localization but with different histology presented with further differences such as more frequent FCD diagnosis by visual inspection of MRI, earlier operation, and less frequent epigastric auras.

Focal cortical dysplasia is a malformation of cortical development, which is the most common cause of medically refractory epilepsy in the pediatric population and the second/third most common etiology of medically intractable seizures in adults.Both genetic and acquired factors are involved in the pathogenesis of cortical dysplasia. Numerous classifications of the complex structural abnormalities of focal cortical dysplasia have been proposed - from Taylor et al. in 1971 to the last modification of Palmini classification made by Blumcke in 2011. In general, three types of cortical dysplasia are recognized.Type I focal cortical dysplasia with mild symptomatic expression and late onset, is more often seen in adults, with changes present in the temporal lobe.Clinical symptoms are more severe in type II of cortical dysplasia usually seen in children. In this type, more extensive changes occur outside the temporal lobe with predilection for the frontal lobes.New type III is one of the above dysplasias with associated another principal lesion as hippocampal sclerosis, tumor, vascular malformation or acquired pathology during early life.Brain MRI imaging shows abnormalities in the majority of type II dysplasias and in only some of type I cortical dysplasias.THE MOST COMMON FINDINGS ON MRI IMAGING INCLUDE: focal cortical thickening or thinning, areas of focal brain atrophy, blurring of the gray-white junction, increased signal on T2- and FLAIR-weighted images in the gray and subcortical white matter often tapering toward the ventricle. On the basis of the MRI findings, it is possible to differentiate between type I and type II cortical dysplasia. A complete resection of the epileptogenic zone is required for seizure-free life. MRI imaging is very helpful to identify those patients who are likely to benefit from surgical treatment in a group of patients with drug-resistant epilepsy.However, in type I cortical dysplasia, MR imaging is often normal, and also in both types the lesion seen on MRI may be smaller than the seizure-generating region seen in the EEG. The abnormalities may also involve vital for life brain parts, where curative surgery will not be an option. Therefore, other diagnostic imaging techniques such as FDG PET, MEG, DTI and intra-cranial EEG are widely used to establish the diagnosis and to decide on management.With advances in both genetics and neuroimaging, we may develop a better understanding of patients with drug-resistant epilepsy, which will help us to provide more successful pharmacological and/or surgical treatment in the future.

Malformation of cortical development (MCD) is a well-known cause of drug-resistant epilepsy and focal cortical dysplasia (FCD) is the most common neuropathological finding in surgical specimens from drug-resistant epilepsy patients. Palmini's classification proposed in 2004 is now widely used to categorize FCD. Recently, however, Blumcke et al. recommended a new system for classifying FCD in 2011. We applied the new classification system in practical diagnosis of a sample of 117 patients who underwent neurosurgical operations due to drug-resistant epilepsy at Severance Hospital in Seoul, Korea. Among 117 cases, a total of 16 cases were shifted to other FCD subtypes under the new classification system. Five cases were reclassified to type IIIa and five cases were categorized as dual pathology. The other six cases were changed within the type I category. The most remarkable changes in the new classification system are the advent of dual pathology and FCD type III. Thus, it will be very important for pathologists and clinicians to discriminate between these new categories. More large-scale research needs to be conducted to elucidate the clinical influence of the alterations within the classification of type I disease. Although the new FCD classification system has several advantages compared to the former, the correlation with clinical characteristics is not yet clear.

Cortical dysplasias comprise a variable spectrum of clinical, neuroradiological and histopathological findings. We report about a cohort of 25 pediatric patients (mean age 8.1+/-4.8 years) with severe drug-resistant early onset focal epilepsies (mean duration 2.1+/-0.4 years), mental/psychomotor retardation, and multilobar epileptogenesis. Compared to age-matched biopsy controls, microscopical inspection of neurosurgically resected specimens revealed dysplastic neurons with/without balloon cells in only 7 patients. According to Palmini's classification system, these lesions were categorized as focal cortical dysplasia (FCD) type II. All other patients presented with rather subtle but statistically significant neuroanatomical abnormalities. We identified increased numbers of ectopic neurons in white matter and cortical gliosis. However, most intriguing was our finding of a microcolumnar arrangement of cortical neurons in layer III. These microcolumns can be statistically defined as vertical lining of more than eight neurons (two times standard deviation of cell countings obtained from controls). In addition, neuronal perikarya were significantly smaller in epilepsy patients. Although histological abnormalities occurring during postnatal maturation of the brain challenge any neuropathological classification in this group of young patients, we propose that these findings are classified according to FCD type I. Our observations support a concept compatible with regional loss of high-order brain organization.

To determine whether voxel-based morphometry (VBM) might contribute to the detection of cortical dysplasia within the temporal pole in patients with mesial temporal lobe epilepsy and hippocampal sclerosis (MTLE/HS). Eighteen patients with intractable MTLE/HS and 30 sex- and age-matched healthy controls were included in the study. All of the patients fulfilled the diagnostic criteria for MTLE/HS and underwent anteromedial temporal resection. VBM without a modulation step was applied to the magnetic resonance (MR) images of the brain. Statistical parametric maps were used to compare structural characteristics such as gray matter concentration (GMC) within the temporal pole among patients and controls separately. The acquired data were then statistically analyzed to determine the congruency between visually inspected MR imaging (MRI) scans and VBM results in the detection of morphologic abnormalities in the temporal pole compared to postoperative histopathologic findings of cortical dysplasia. Histopathologic examination revealed cortical dysplasia within the temporal pole in 11 patients. In detail, according to Palmini's classification, mild malformations of cortical development (mMCDs) were disclosed in three patients, focal cortical dysplasia (FCD) type Ia in three patients, and FCD type Ib in five patients. Some type of structural temporal pole abnormality was suggested by VBM in 14 patients and by visually inspected MRI scans in 11 patients. The results of VBM were in agreement with the presence/absence of cortical dysplasia in 13 patients (72.2%); this correspondence was significant (p = 0.047). In one case, VBM was false negative and in four cases it was false positive. There was congruence between the results of visual analysis and histologic proof in 55.6% of examined patients, which was not significant. We found that VBM made a superior contribution to the detection of temporopolar structural malformations (cortical dysplasia) compared to visual inspection. The agreement with postoperative histopathologic proof was clearly significant for VBM results and nonsignificant for visual inspection.
