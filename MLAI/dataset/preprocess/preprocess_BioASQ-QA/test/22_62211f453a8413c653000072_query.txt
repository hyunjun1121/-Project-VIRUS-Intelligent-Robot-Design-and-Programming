What protein is encoded by the GRN gene?

[PMID: 31962288]
Frontotemporal degeneration (FTD) is a complex disease presenting as a spectrum of clinical disorders with progressive degeneration of frontal and temporal brain cortices and extensive neuroinflammation that result in personality and behavior changes, and eventually, death. There are currently no effective therapies for FTD. While 60-70% of FTD patients are sporadic cases, the other 30-40% are heritable (familial) cases linked to mutations in several known genes. We focus here on FTD caused by mutations in the GRN gene, which encodes a secreted protein, progranulin (PGRN), that has diverse roles in regulating cell survival, immune responses, and autophagy and lysosome function in the brain. FTD-linked mutations in GRN reduce brain PGRN levels that lead to autophagy and lysosome dysfunction, TDP43 accumulation, excessive microglial activation, astrogliosis, and neuron death through still poorly understood mechanisms. PGRN insufficiency has also been linked to Alzheimer's disease (AD), and so the development of therapeutics for GRN-linked FTD that restore PGRN levels and function may have broader application for other neurodegenerative diseases. This review focuses on a strategy to increase PGRN to functional, healthy levels in the brain by identifying novel genetic and chemical modulators of neuronal PGRN levels. This article is part of the special issue entitled 'The Quest for Disease-Modifying Therapies for Neurodegenerative Disorders'.

Frontotemporal lobar degeneration (FTLD) is a devastating neurodegenerative disease that is the second most common form of dementia affecting individuals under age 65. The most common pathological subtype, FTLD with transactive response DNA-binding protein with a molecular weight of 43 kDa inclusions (FTLD-TDP), is often caused by autosomal dominant mutations in the progranulin gene (GRN) encoding the progranulin protein (PGRN). GRN pathogenic mutations result in haploinsufficiency, usually by nonsense-mediated decay of the mRNA. Since the discovery of these mutations in 2006, several groups have published data and animal models that provide further insight into the genetic and functional relevance of PGRN in the context of FTLD-TDP. These studies were critical in initiating our understanding of the role of PGRN in neural development, degeneration, synaptic transmission, cell signaling, and behavior. Furthermore, recent publications have now identified the receptors for PGRN, which will hopefully lead to additional therapeutic targets. Additionally, drug screens have been conducted to identify pharmacological regulators of PGRN levels to be used as potential treatments for PGRN haploinsufficiency. Here we review recent literature describing relevant data on GRN genetics, cell culture experiments describing the potential role and regulators of PGRN in the central nervous system, animal models of PGRN deficiency, and potential PGRN-related FTLD therapies that are currently underway. The present review aims to underscore the necessity of further elucidation of PGRN biology in FTLD-related neurodegeneration.

Neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer's disease have proven resistant to new treatments. The complexity of neurodegenerative disease mechanisms can be highlighted by accumulating evidence for a role for a growth factor, progranulin (PGRN). PGRN is a glycoprotein encoded by the GRN/Grn gene with multiple cellular functions, including neurotrophic, anti-inflammatory and lysosome regulatory properties. Mutations in the GRN gene can lead to frontotemporal lobar degeneration (FTLD), a cause of dementia, and neuronal ceroid lipofuscinosis (NCL), a lysosomal storage disease. Both diseases are associated with loss of PGRN function resulting, amongst other features, in enhanced microglial neuroinflammation and lysosomal dysfunction. PGRN has also been implicated in Alzheimer's disease (AD). Unlike FTLD, increased expression of PGRN occurs in brains of human AD cases and AD model mice, particularly in activated microglia. How microglial PGRN might be involved in AD and other neurodegenerative diseases will be discussed. A unifying feature of PGRN in diseases might be its modulation of lysosomal function in neurons and microglia. Many experimental models have focused on consequences of PGRN gene deletion: however, possible outcomes of increasing PGRN on microglial inflammation and neurodegeneration will be discussed. We will also suggest directions for future studies on PGRN and microglia in relation to neurodegenerative diseases.

Mutations in the GRN gene coding for progranulin (PGRN) are responsible for many cases of familial frontotemporal lobar degeneration (FTLD) with TAR DNA-binding protein 43 (TDP-43)-positive inclusions (FTLD-TDP). GRN mutations create null alleles resulting in decreased progranulin protein or haploinsufficiency. FTLD-TDP with GRN mutations is characterized by lentiform neuronal intranuclear inclusions that are positive for TDP-43 in affected brain regions. In this study, by stably expressed short hairpin RNA, we established a neuroblastoma cell line with decreased PGRN level. This cell line reveals TDP-43-positive intranuclear inclusions. In addition, replacement with purified PGRN protein restores normal TDP-43 nuclear distribution. This cell model can be valuable for the study of the role of PGRN in the pathogenesis in FTLD-TDP.

It has been more than a decade since heterozygous loss-of-function mutations in the progranulin gene (GRN) were first identified as an important genetic cause of frontotemporal lobar degeneration (FTLD). Due to the highly diverse biological functions of the progranulin (PGRN) protein, encoded by GRN, multiple possible disease mechanisms have been proposed. Early work focused on the neurotrophic properties of PGRN and its role in the inflammatory response. However, since the discovery of homozygous GRN mutations in patients with a lysosomal storage disorder, investigation into the possible roles of PGRN and its proteolytic cleavage products granulins, in lysosomal function and dysfunction, has taken center stage. In this chapter, we summarize the GRN mutational spectrum and its associated phenotypes followed by an in-depth discussion on the possible disease mechanisms implicated in FTLD-GRN. We conclude with key outstanding questions which urgently require answers to ensure safe and successful therapy development for GRN mutation carriers.

Heterozygous, loss-of-function mutations in the granulin gene (GRN) encoding progranulin (PGRN) are a common cause of frontotemporal dementia (FTD). Homozygous GRN mutations cause neuronal ceroid lipofuscinosis-11 (CLN11), a lysosome storage disease. PGRN is a secreted glycoprotein that can be proteolytically cleaved into seven bioactive 6Â kDa granulins. However, it is unclear how deficiency of PGRN and granulins causes neurodegeneration. To gain insight into the mechanisms of FTD pathogenesis, we utilized Tandem Mass Tag isobaric labeling mass spectrometry to perform an unbiased quantitative proteomic analysis of whole-brain tissue from wild type (Grn<sup>+/+</sup>) and Grn knockout (Grn<sup>-/-</sup>) mice at 3- and 19-months of age. At 3-months lysosomal proteins (i.e. Gns, Scarb2, Hexb) are selectively increased indicating lysosomal dysfunction is an early consequence of PGRN deficiency. Additionally, proteins involved in lipid metabolism (Acly, Apoc3, Asah1, Gpld1, Ppt1, and Naaa) are decreased; suggesting lysosomal degradation of lipids may be impaired in the Grn<sup>-/-</sup> brain. Systems biology using weighted correlation network analysis (WGCNA) of the Grn<sup>-/-</sup> brain proteome identified 26 modules of highly co-expressed proteins. Three modules strongly correlated to Grn deficiency and were enriched with lysosomal proteins (Gpnmb, CtsD, CtsZ, and Tpp1) and inflammatory proteins (Lgals3, GFAP, CD44, S100a, and C1qa). We find that lysosomal dysregulation is exacerbated with age in the Grn<sup>-/-</sup> mouse brain leading to neuroinflammation, synaptic loss, and decreased markers of oligodendrocytes, myelin, and neurons. In particular, GPNMB and LGALS3 (galectin-3) were upregulated by microglia and elevated in FTD-GRN brain samples, indicating common pathogenic pathways are dysregulated in human FTD cases and Grn<sup>-/-</sup> mice. GPNMB levels were significantly increased in the cerebrospinal fluid of FTD-GRN patients, but not in MAPT or C9orf72 carriers, suggesting GPNMB could be a biomarker specific to FTD-GRN to monitor disease onset, progression, and drug response. Our findings support the idea that insufficiency of PGRN and granulins in humans causes neurodegeneration through lysosomal dysfunction, defects in autophagy, and neuroinflammation, which could be targeted to develop effective therapies.

Numerous kindreds with familial frontotemporal lobar degeneration have been linked to mutations in microtubule-associated protein tau (MAPT) or progranulin (GRN) genes. While there are many similarities in the clinical manifestations and associated neuroimaging findings, there are also distinct differences. In this review, we compare and contrast the demographic/inheritance characteristics, histopathology, pathophysiology, clinical aspects, and key neuroimaging findings between those with MAPT and GRN mutations.

Loss-of-function mutations in the gene encoding for the protein progranulin (PGRN), GRN, are one of the major genetic abnormalities involved in frontotemporal lobar degeneration. However, genetic variations, mainly missense, in GRN have also been linked to other neurodegenerative diseases. We found 12 different pathogenic/likely pathogenic variants in 21 patients identified in a cohort of Italian patients affected by various neurodegenerative disorders. We detected the p.Thr272SerfsTer10 as the most frequent, followed by the c.1179+3A>G variant. We characterized the clinical phenotype of 12 patients from 3 pedigrees carrying the c.1179+3A>G variant, demonstrated the pathogenicity of this mutation, and detected other rarer variants causing haploinsufficiency (p.Met1?, c.709-2A>T, p.Gly79AspfsTer39). Finally, by applying bioinformatics, neuropathological, and biochemical studies, we characterized 6 missense/synonymous variants (p.Asp94His, p.Gly117Asp, p.Ala266Pro, p.Val279Val, p.Arg298His, p.Ala505Gly), including 4 previously unreported. The designation of variants is crucial for genetic counseling and the enrollment of patients in clinical studies.

Loss-of-function mutations in the progranulin gene (GRN), which encodes progranulin (PGRN), are a major cause of frontotemporal dementia (FTD). GRN-associated FTD is characterized by TDP-43 inclusions and neuroinflammation, but how PGRN loss causes disease remains elusive. We show that Grn knockout (KO) mice have increased microgliosis in white matter and an accumulation of myelin debris in microglial lysosomes in the same regions. Accumulation of myelin debris is also observed in white matter of patients with GRN-associated FTD. In addition, our findings also suggest that PGRN insufficiency in microglia leads to impaired lysosomal-mediated clearance of myelin debris. Finally, Grn KO mice that are deficient in cathepsin D (Ctsd), a key lysosomal enzyme, have augmented myelin debris and increased neuronal TDP-43 pathology. Together, our data strongly imply that PGRN loss affects microglial activation and lysosomal function, resulting in the accumulation of myelin debris and contributing to TDP-43 pathology.

Single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in TMEM106B encoding the lysosomal type II transmembrane protein 106B increase the risk for frontotemporal lobar degeneration (FTLD) of GRN (progranulin gene) mutation carriers. Currently, it is unclear if progranulin (PGRN) and TMEM106B are synergistically linked and if a gain or a loss of function of TMEM106B is responsible for the increased disease risk of patients with GRN haploinsufficiency. We therefore compare behavioral abnormalities, gene expression patterns, lysosomal activity, and TDP-43 pathology in single and double knockout animals. Grn<sup>-/-</sup> /Tmem106b<sup>-/-</sup> mice show a strongly reduced life span and massive motor deficits. Gene expression analysis reveals an upregulation of molecular signature characteristic for disease-associated microglia and autophagy. Dysregulation of maturation of lysosomal proteins as well as an accumulation of ubiquitinated proteins and widespread p62 deposition suggest that proteostasis is impaired. Moreover, while single Grn<sup>-/-</sup> knockouts only occasionally show TDP-43 pathology, the double knockout mice exhibit deposition of phosphorylated TDP-43. Thus, a loss of function of TMEM106B may enhance the risk for GRN-associated FTLD by reduced protein turnover in the lysosomal/autophagic system.

Progranulin (PGRN) is a protein encoded by the GRN gene with multiple identified functions including as a neurotrophic factor, tumorigenic growth factor, anti-inflammatory cytokine and regulator of lysosomal function. A single mutation in the human GRN gene resulting in reduced PGRN expression causes types of frontotemporal lobar degeneration resulting in frontotemporal dementia. Prosaposin (PSAP) is also a multifunctional neuroprotective secreted protein and regulator of lysosomal function. Interactions of PGRN and PSAP affect their functional properties. Their roles in Alzheimer's disease (AD), the leading cause of dementia, have not been defined. In this report, we examined in detail the cellular expression of PGRN in middle temporal gyrus samples of a series of human brain cases (nÂ =â45) staged for increasing plaque pathology. Immunohistochemistry showed PGRN expression in cortical neurons, microglia, cerebral vessels and amyloid beta (AÎ²) plaques, while PSAP expression was mainly detected in neurons and AÎ² plaques, and to a limited extent in astrocytes. We showed that there were increased levels of PGRN protein in AD cases and corresponding increased levels of PSAP. Levels of PGRN and PSAP protein positively correlated with amyloid beta (AÎ²), with PGRN levels correlating with phosphorylated tau (serine 205) levels in these samples. Although PGRN colocalized with lysosomal-associated membrane protein-1 in neurons, most PGRN associated with AÎ² plaques did not. AÎ² plaques with PGRN and PSAP deposits were identified in the low plaque non-demented cases suggesting this was an early event in plaque formation. We did not observe PGRN-positive neurofibrillary tangles. Co-immunoprecipitation studies of PGRN from brain samples identified only PSAP associated with PGRN, not sortilin or other known PGRN-binding proteins, under conditions used. Most PGRN associated with AÎ² plaques were immunoreactive for PSAP showing a high degree of colocalization of these proteins that did not change between disease groups. As PGRN supplementation has been considered as a therapeutic approach for AD, the possible involvement of PGRN and PSAP interactions in AD pathology needs to be further considered.

GRN, the gene coding for the progranulin (PGRN) protein, was recognized as a gene linked to frontotemporal lobar degeneration (FTLD). The first mutations identified were null mutations giving rise to haploinsufficiency. Missense mutations were subsequently detected, but only a small subset has been functionally investigated. We identified missense mutations (C105Y, A199V, and R298H) in FTLD cases with family history and/or with low plasma PGRN levels. The aim of this study was to determine their pathogenicity. We performed functional studies, analyzing PGRN expression, secretion, and cleavage by elastase. GRN C105Y affected both secretion and elastase cleavage, likely representing a pathogenic mutation. GRN A199V did not alter the physiological properties of PGRN and GRN R298H produced only moderate effects on PGRN secretion, indicating that their pathogenicity is uncertain. In the absence of strong segregation data and neuropathological examinations, genetic, biomarker, and functional studies can be applied to an algorithm to assess the likelihood of pathogenicity for a mutation. This information can improve our understanding of the complex mechanisms by which GRN mutations lead to FTLD.

Mutation in the GRN gene, encoding the progranulin (PGRN) protein, shows a dose-dependent disease correlation, wherein haploinsufficiency results in frontotemporal lobar degeneration (FTLD) and complete loss results in neuronal ceroid lipofuscinosis (NCL). Although the exact function of PGRN is unknown, it has been increasingly implicated in lysosomal physiology. Here we report that PGRN interacts with the lysosomal enzyme, glucocerebrosidase (GCase), and is essential for proper GCase activity. GCase activity is significantly reduced in tissue lysates from PGRN-deficient mice. This is further evidence that reduced lysosomal hydrolase activity may be a pathological mechanism in cases of GRN-related FTLD and NCL.

Progranulin (PGRN), encoded by the GRN gene in humans, is a secreted growth factor implicated in a multitude of processes ranging from regulation of inflammation to wound healing and tumorigenesis. The clinical importance of PGRN became especially evident in 2006, when heterozygous mutations in the GRN gene, resulting in haploinsufficiency, were found to be one of the main causes of frontotemporal lobar degeneration (FTLD). FTLD is a clinically heterogenous disease that results in the progressive atrophy of the frontal and temporal lobes of the brain. Despite significant research, the exact function of PGRN and its mechanistic relationship to FTLD remain unclear. However, growing evidence suggests a role for PGRN in the lysosome-most striking being that homozygous GRN mutation leads to neuronal ceroid lipofuscinosis, a lysosomal storage disease. Since this discovery, several links between PGRN and the lysosome have been established, including the existence of two independent lysosomal trafficking pathways, intralysosomal processing of PGRN into discrete functional peptides, and direct and indirect regulation of lysosomal hydrolases. Here, we summarize theÂ cellular functions of PGRN, itsÂ roles in the nervous system, and its link to multiple neurodegenerative diseases, with a particular focus dedicated to recent lysosome-related mechanistic developments.

The granulin protein (also known as, and hereafter referred to as, progranulin) is a secreted glycoprotein that contributes to overall brain health. Heterozygous loss-of-function mutations in the gene encoding the progranulin protein (Granulin Precursor, GRN) are a common cause of familial frontotemporal dementia (FTD). Gene therapy approaches that aim to increase progranulin expression from a single wild-type allele, an area of active investigation for the potential treatment of GRN-dependent FTD, will benefit from the availability of a mouse model that expresses a genomic copy of the human GRN gene. Here we report the development and characterization of a novel mouse model that expresses the entire human GRN gene in its native genomic context as a single copy inserted into a defined locus (Hprt) in the mouse genome. We show that human and mouse progranulin are expressed in a similar tissue-specific pattern, suggesting that the two genes are regulated by similar mechanisms. Human progranulin rescues a phenotype characteristic of progranulin-null mice, the exaggerated and early deposition of the aging pigment lipofuscin in the brain, indicating that the two proteins are functionally similar. Longitudinal behavioural and neuropathological analyses revealed no significant differences between wild-type and human progranulin-overexpressing mice up to 18Â months of age, providing evidence that long-term increase of progranulin levels is well tolerated in mice. Finally, we demonstrate that human progranulin expression can be increased in the brain using an antisense oligonucleotide that inhibits a known GRN-regulating micro-RNA, demonstrating that the transgene is responsive to potential gene therapy drugs. Human progranulin-expressing mice represent a novel and valuable tool to expedite the development of progranulin-modulating therapeutics.

Progranulin protein (PGRN) is a cysteine-rich growth factor encoded by the progranulin gene (GRN). PGRN mutations were identified in patients with frontotemporal lobar degeneration (FTLD) and recently its role as risk factor has been described in patients with probable Alzheimer's disease (AD). To date, more than 100 genetic variants in GRN gene have been described and the pathogenic nature is still unclear for almost 36% of them. Here, we describe three clinical cases carrying the PGRN variation Cys139Arg in order to increase the knowledge on the association of this variant to the clinical spectrum of FTLD. The genetic analysis was performed using high resolution melting analysis. The Human Progranulin ELISA Kit was used in order to determine PGRN expression levels in the plasma samples. The three patients carrying the genetic variation showed three final different clinical diagnosis, respectively behavioral frontotemporal dementia, semantic dementia, and corticobasal syndrome, thus underlining the clinical heterogeneity typically associated with GRN mutations. All cases shared similar plasma PGRN levels that resulted intermediate between those measured in controls and in GRN null mutation carriers, showing a partial reduction of the protein in plasma. Moreover, according to the bioinformatics software, the Cys139Arg variation causes a decreased stability of the structure of the protein. We describe three new patients affected by neurological syndromes included in the clinical spectrum of FTLD carrying the Cys139Arg genetic variant, thus suggesting a possible implication in the pathogenesis of FTLD.

Understanding of frontotemporal lobar degeneration, the underlying pathology most often linked to the clinical diagnosis of frontotemporal dementia, is rapidly increasing. Mutations in 7 known genes (MAPT, GRN, C9orf72, VCP, CHMP2B, and, rarely, TARDBP and FUS) are associated with frontotemporal dementia, and the pathologic classification of frontotemporal lobar degeneration has recently been modified to reflect these discoveries. Mutations in one of these genes (GRN), which encodes progranulin, have been implicated in up to a quarter of cases of frontotemporal lobar degeneration with TDP-43 (TAR DNA-binding protein 43)-positive inclusions; currently, there are more than 60 known pathogenic mutations of the gene. We present the clinical, pathologic, and genetic findings on 6 cases from 4 families, 5 of which were shown to have a novel GRN c.708+6_+9delTGAG mutation.

Homozygous or heterozygous mutations in the <i>GRN</i> gene, encoding progranulin (PGRN), cause neuronal ceroid lipofuscinosis (NCL) or frontotemporal dementia (FTD), respectively. NCL and FTD are characterized by lysosome dysfunction and neurodegeneration, indicating PGRN is important for lysosome homeostasis in the brain. PGRN is trafficked to the lysosome where its functional role is unknown. PGRN can be cleaved into seven 6-kDa proteins called granulins (GRNs); however, little is known about how GRNs are produced or if levels of GRNs are altered in FTD-<i>GRN</i> mutation carriers. Here, we report the identification and characterization of antibodies that reliably detect several human GRNs by immunoblot and immunocytochemistry. Using these tools, we find that endogenous GRNs are present within multiple cell lines and are constitutively produced. Further, extracellular PGRN is endocytosed and rapidly processed into stable GRNs within lysosomes. Processing of PGRN into GRNs is conserved between humans and mice and is modulated by sortilin expression and mediated by cysteine proteases (i.e. cathpesin L). Induced lysosome dysfunction caused by alkalizing agents or increased expression of transmembrane protein 106B (TMEM106B) inhibit processing of PGRN into GRNs. Finally, we find that multiple GRNs are haploinsufficient in primary fibroblasts and cortical brain tissue from FTD-<i>GRN</i> patients. Taken together, our findings raise the interesting possibility that GRNs carry out critical lysosomal functions and that loss of GRNs should be explored as an initiating factor in lysosomal dysfunction and neurodegeneration caused by <i>GRN</i> mutations.

Loss-of-function mutations in <i>GRN</i> cause frontotemporal dementia (FTD) with transactive response DNA-binding protein of 43 kD (TDP-43)-positive inclusions and neuronal ceroid lipofuscinosis (NCL). There are no disease-modifying therapies for either FTD or NCL, in part because of a poor understanding of how mutations in genes such as <i>GRN</i> contribute to disease pathogenesis and neurodegeneration. By studying mice lacking progranulin (PGRN), the protein encoded by <i>GRN</i>, we discovered multiple lines of evidence that PGRN deficiency results in impairment of autophagy, a key cellular degradation pathway. PGRN-deficient mice are sensitive to <i>Listeria monocytogenes</i> because of deficits in xenophagy, a specialized form of autophagy that mediates clearance of intracellular pathogens. Cells lacking PGRN display reduced autophagic flux, and pathological forms of TDP-43 typically cleared by autophagy accumulate more rapidly in PGRN-deficient neurons. Our findings implicate autophagy as a novel therapeutic target for <i>GRN</i>-associated NCL and FTD and highlight the emerging theme of defective autophagy in the broader FTD/amyotrophic lateral sclerosis spectrum of neurodegenerative disease.

Progranulin (PGRN) encoded by the GRN gene, is a secreted glycoprotein growth factor that has been implicated in many physiological and pathophysiological processes. PGRN haploinsufficiency caused by autosomal dominant mutations within the GRN gene leads to progressive neuronal atrophy in the form of frontotemporal lobar degeneration (FTLD). This form of the disease is associated with neuronal inclusions that bear the ubiquitinated TAR DNA Binding Protein-43 (TDP-43) molecular signature (FTLD-U). The neurotrophic properties of PGRN in vitro have recently been reported but the role of PGRN in neurons is not well understood. Here we document the neuronal expression and functions of PGRN in spinal cord motoneuron (MN) maturation and branching in vivo using zebrafish, a well established model of vertebrate embryonic development. Whole-mount in situ hybridization and immunohistochemical analyses of zebrafish embryos revealed that zfPGRN-A is expressed within the peripheral and central nervous systems including the caudal primary (CaP) MNs within the spinal cord. Knockdown of zfPGRN-A mRNA translation mediated by antisense morpholino oligonucleotides disrupted normal CaP MN development resulting in both truncated MNs and inappropriate early branching. Ectopic over-expression of zfPGRN-A mRNA resulted in increased MN branching and rescued the truncation defects brought about by knockdown of zfPGRN-A expression. The ability of PGRN to interact with established MN developmental pathways was tested. PGRN over-expression was found to reverse the truncation defect resulting from knockdown of Survival of motor neuron 1 (smn1). This is involved in small ribonucleoprotein biogenesis RNA processing, mutations of which cause Spinal Muscular Atrophy (SMA) in humans. It did not reverse the MN defects caused by interfering with the neuronal guidance pathway by knockdown of expression of NRP-1, a semaphorin co-receptor. Expression of PGRN within MNs and the observed phenotypes resulting from mRNA knockdown and over-expression are consistent with a role in the regulation of spinal cord MN development and branching. This study presents the first in vivo demonstration of the neurotrophic properties of PGRN and suggests possible future therapeutic applications in the treatment of neurodegenerative diseases.

Progranulin is a growth factor involved in the regulation of multiple processes including tumorigenesis, wound repair, development, and inflammation. The recent discovery that mutations in the gene encoding for progranulin (GRN) cause frontotemporal lobar degeneration (FTLD), and other neurodegenerative diseases leading to dementia, has brought renewed interest in progranulin and its functions in the central nervous system. GRN null mutations cause protein haploinsufficiency, leading to a significant decrease in progranulin levels that can be detected in plasma, serum and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) of mutation carriers. The dosage of circulating progranulin sped up the identification of GRN mutations thus favoring genotype-phenotype correlation studies. Researchers demonstrated that, in GRN null mutation carriers, the shortage of progranulin invariably precedes clinical symptoms and thus mutation carriers are "captured" regardless of their disease status. GRN is a particularly appealing gene for drug targeting, in the way that boosting its expression may be beneficial for mutation carriers, preventing or delaying the onset of GRN-related neurodegenerative diseases. Physiological regulation of progranulin expression level is only partially known. Progranulin expression reflects mutation status and, intriguingly, its levels can be modulated by some additional factor (i.e. genetic background; drugs). Thus, factors increasing the production and secretion of progranulin from the normal gene are promising potential therapeutic avenues. In conclusion, peripheral progranulin is a nonintrusive highly accurate biomarker for early identification of mutation carriers and for monitoring future treatments that might boost the level of this protein.

Progranulin, a secreted glycoprotein, is encoded in humans by the single GRN gene. Progranulin consists of seven and a half, tandemly repeated, non-identical copies of the 12 cysteine granulin motif. Many cellular processes and diseases are associated with this unique pleiotropic factor that include, but are not limited to, embryogenesis, tumorigenesis, inflammation, wound repair, neurodegeneration and lysosome function. Haploinsufficiency caused by autosomal dominant mutations within the GRN gene leads to frontotemporal lobar degeneration, a progressive neuronal atrophy that presents in patients as frontotemporal dementia. Frontotemporal dementia is an early onset form of dementia, distinct from Alzheimer's disease. The GRN-related form of frontotemporal lobar dementia is a proteinopathy characterized by the appearance of neuronal inclusions containing ubiquitinated and fragmented TDP-43 (encoded by TARDBP). The neurotrophic and neuro-immunomodulatory properties of progranulin have recently been reported but are still not well understood. Gene delivery of GRN in experimental models of Alzheimer's- and Parkinson's-like diseases inhibits phenotype progression. Here we review what is currently known concerning the molecular function and mechanism of action of progranulin in normal physiological and pathophysiological conditions in both in vitro and in vivo models. The potential therapeutic applications of progranulin in treating neurodegenerative diseases are highlighted.
