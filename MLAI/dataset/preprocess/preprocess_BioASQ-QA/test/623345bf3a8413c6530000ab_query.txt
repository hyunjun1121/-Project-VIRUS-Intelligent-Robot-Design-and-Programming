[PMID: 31239716]
<b>Background:</b> Extensive research has shown that long noncoding RNA (lncRNA) is involved in tumorigenesis, including hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). The lncRNA LINC00339 was reported to regulate the development of lung cancer or breast cancer. However, whether LINC00339 participates in HCC progression remains unclear. Here, our results showed that LINC00339 was upregulated in HCC. <b>Methods:</b> qRT-PCR and in situ hybridization (ISH) was used to analyze LINC00339 expression in tumor tissues and cell lines. CCK8 and colony formation assays were used to analyze cell proliferation. Transwell assay was used to analyze cell migration and invasion. Xenograft experiment was used to test tumor growth in vivo. <b>Results:</b> LINC00339 overexpression was correlated with an advanced stage, metastasis, and bad prognosis in HCC patients. Functional investigation showed that LINC00339 knockdown significantly suppressed HCC cell proliferation, migration, and invasion. Moreover, decreased LINC00339 expression inhibited HCC growth in vivo. Mechanistically, LINC00339 could interact with miR-1182 to promote SKA1 expression. We also demonstrated that SKA1 acted as an oncogene and SKA1 upregulation reversed the effect of LINC00339 silencing. <b>Conclusion:</b> Our results illustrated that the LINC00339/miR-1182/SKA1 axis plays an essential role in HCC progression.

<b>Objective:</b> To investigate the expression of long non-coding RNA LINC00339 in colorectal cancer patients and its effect and mechanism on proliferation and apoptosis of colorectal cancer cells. <b>Methods:</b> A retrospective analysis of 158 pathology-confirmed colorectal cancer patients, who were enrolled from August 2015 to January 2017, was performed. LINC00339 expression in colorectal cancer tissues and adjacent colorectal sampleswas detected by Real-time PCR. The correlation between LINC00339 expression and clinicopathological features as well as the relationship between LINC00339 and microRNA (miR)-218 expression was assayed. The interaction between LINC00339 and miR-218 was further confirmed by dual luciferase report system. Downregulation of LINC00339 was performed by siRNA interference technology in LoVo and HCT116 cells. Real-time PCR was used to detect miR-218 expression. 3-(4,5-dimethyl-2-thiazolyl)-2, 5-diphenyl-2-H-tetrazolium bromide (MTT) analysis was carried out to examine cell viability. Flow cytometry was used to determine cell apoptosis. Additionally, LINC00339 siRNA and miR-218 antagomirs (anti-miR-218) were co-transfected into LoVo and HCT116 cells, and then cell viability and apoptosis were detected. <b>Results:</b> LINC00339 expression was significantly increased in colorectal cancer tissues compared with adjacent colorectal tissues (4.69±1.52 vs 1.02±0.38, <i>P<</i>0.05). LINC00339 expression was not related to the age and gender of patients (<i>P></i>0.05), but was associated with TNM stage, lymphatic metastasis, tumor maximum diameters, and differentiation degree (all <i>P<</i>0.05). LINC00339 expression was negatively correlated with miR-218 expression in colorectal cancer tissues (<i>P<</i>0.05). miR-218 mimics remarkably suppressed the fluorescence intensity of wild-type LINC00339 plasmid (<i>P=</i>0.001), but did not affect the fluorescence intensity of the mutant ones(<i>P=</i>0.88). Knockdown of LINC00339 remarkably inhibited proliferation, but promoted apoptosis of LoVo and HCT116 cells (all <i>P<</i>0.05). Compared with cells transfected with LINC00339 siRNA only, downregulation of miR-218 elevated proliferation and decreased apoptosis of LoVoand HCT116 cells. <b>Conclusions:</b> LINC00339 expression is upregulated in colorectal cancer tissues and correlated with patients' clinicopathological features. LINC00339 promotes proliferation, and suppresses apoptosis of colorectal cancer cells via downregulating miR-218.

Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have identified markers within the WNT4 region on chromosome 1p36.12 showing consistent and strong association with increasing endometriosis risk. Fine mapping using sequence and imputed genotype data has revealed strong candidates for the causal SNPs within these critical regions; however, the molecular pathogenesis of these SNPs is currently unknown. We used gene expression data collected from whole blood from 862 individuals and endometrial tissue from 136 individuals from independent populations of European descent to examine the mechanism underlying endometriosis susceptibility. Association mapping results from 7,090 individuals (2,594 cases and 4,496 controls) supported rs3820282 as the SNP with the strongest association for endometriosis risk (P = 1.84 × 10−5, OR = 1.244 (1.126-1.375)). SNP rs3820282 is a significant eQTL in whole blood decreasing expression of LINC00339 (also known as HSPC157) and increasing expression of CDC42 (P = 2.0 ×10−54 and 4.5x10−4 respectively). The largest effects were for two LINC00339 probes (P = 2.0 ×10−54; 1.0 × 10−34). The eQTL for LINC00339 was also observed in endometrial tissue (P = 2.4 ×10−8) with the same direction of effect for both whole blood and endometrial tissue. There was no evidence for eQTL effects for WNT4. Chromatin conformation capture provides evidence for risk SNPs interacting with the promoters of both LINC00339 and CDC4 and luciferase reporter assays suggest the risk SNP rs12038474 is located in a transcriptional silencer for CDC42 and the risk allele increases expression of CDC42. However, no effect of rs3820282 was observed in the LINC00339 expression in Ishikawa cells. Taken together, our results suggest that SNPs increasing endometriosis risk in this region act through CDC42, but further functional studies are required to rule out inverse regulation of both LINC00339 and CDC42.

Liver hepatocellular carcinoma (LIHC) is a lethal cancer. This study aimed to identify the N<sup>6</sup> -methyladenosine (m<sup>6</sup> A)-targeted long non-coding RNA (lncRNA) related to LIHC prognosis and to develop an m<sup>6</sup> A-targeted lncRNA model for prognosis prediction in LIHC. The expression matrix of mRNA and lncRNA was obtained, and differentially expressed (DE) mRNAs and lncRNAs between tumor and normal samples were identified. Univariate Cox and pathway enrichment analyses were performed on the m<sup>6</sup> A-targeted lncRNAs and the LIHC prognosis-related m<sup>6</sup> A-targeted lncRNAs. Prognostic analysis, immune infiltration, and gene DE analyses were performed on LIHC subgroups, which were obtained from unsupervised clustering analysis. Additionally, a multi-factor Cox analysis was used to construct a prognostic risk model based on the lncRNAs from the LASSO Cox model. Univariate and multivariate Cox analyses were used to assess prognostic independence. A total of 5031 significant DEmRNAs and 292 significant DElncRNAs were screened, and 72 LIHC-specific m<sup>6</sup> A-targeted binding lncRNAs were screened. Moreover, a total of 29 LIHC prognosis-related m<sup>6</sup> A-targeted lncRNAs were obtained and enriched in cytoskeletal, spliceosome, and cell cycle pathways. An 11-m<sup>6</sup> A-lncRNA prognostic model was constructed and verified; the top 10 lncRNAs included LINC00152, RP6-65G23.3, RP11-620J15.3, RP11-290F5.1, RP11-147L13.13, RP11-923I11.6, AC092171.4, KB-1460A1.5, LINC00339, and RP11-119D9.1. Additionally, the two LIHC subgroups, Cluster 1 and Cluster 2, showed significant differences in the immune microenvironment, m<sup>6</sup> A enzyme genes, and prognosis of LIHC. The m<sup>6</sup> A-lncRNA prognostic model accurately and effectively predicted the prognostic survival of LIHC. Immune cells, immune checkpoints (ICs), and m<sup>6</sup> A enzyme genes could act as novel therapeutic targets for LIHC.

Up to date, the mechanism of gastric cancer (GC) development is poorly understood. This study was to demonstrate the effects of LINC00339 on GC progression. Here, we found that LINC00339 was overexpressed expressed in GC tissues and predicted poor outcome. By CCK8, colony formation and Transwell assays, we showed LINC00339 knockdown suppressed GC cell proliferation, migration, and invasion in vitro. Flow cytometry analysis (FACS) indicated that LINC00339 knockdown induced tumor cell apoptosis. Besides, we utilized the xenograft assay and found that LINC00339 depletion led to decreased tumor growth in vivo. Mechanistically, miR-377-3p was found to be inhibited by LINC00339. And LINC00339 suppressed miR-377-3p to upregulate DCP1A, which consequently promoted GC progression. In conclusion, LINC00339 promotes gastric cancer progression by elevating DCP1A expression via inhibiting miR-377-3p.

To investigate the role and mechanism of long non-coding (lnc) RNA LINC00339 in pancreatic cancer (PANC), and provided a potential target for its biological diagnosis and treatment. Quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) was used to detect the expression of LINC00339 in PANC tissue specimens and cell lines. The experimental cell lines differentially expressing LINC00339 were constructed by using small interfering RNA and lentivirus transfection. Cell proliferation was examined by cell counting kit-8 (CCK-8) and colony formation experiments and transwell experiments were used to assess cell invasion and migration abilities. The luciferase assay and RNA immunoprecipitation (RIP) were employed to study the target gene for LINC00339, and western blot analysis was utilized to measure protein expression of the downstream gene. The level of LINC00339 expression in PANC tissues or cells was significantly higher than that in their respective control groups. Interfering expression of LINC00339 could notably inhibit the proliferation, invasion and migration of SW1990 cells, while the over-expressing expression of LINC00339 obviously increased the growth and metastasis abilities of PANC-1 cells. LINC00339 could act as a miR-497-5p sponge, adsorbing miR-497-5p, thereby inhibiting its action by increasing the expression of its target gene IGF1R. The expression of miR-497-5p and its target gene IGF1R could be significantly altered by altering the expression of LINC00339. LINC00339 was markedly over-expressed in PANC tissues and cells and promoted cell proliferation, invasion, and migration via sponging miR-497-5p, thereby increasing IGF1R expression. Our study could provide a novel target for PANC diagnosis and biotherapy.

In recent years, triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) has emerged as the most aggressive subtype of breast cancer and is usually associated with increased mortality worldwide. The severity of TNBC is primarily observed in younger women, with cases ranging from approximately 12%-24% of all breast cancer cases. The existing hormonal therapies offer limited clinical solutions in completely circumventing the TNBC, with chemoresistance and tumor recurrences being the common hurdles in the path of TNBC treatment. Accumulating evidence has correlated the dysregulation of long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) with increased cell proliferation, invasion, migration, tumor growth, chemoresistance, and decreased apoptosis in TNBC. Various clinical studies have revealed that aberrant expression of lncRNAs in TNBC tissues is associated with poor prognosis, lower overall survival, and disease-free survival. Due to these specific characteristics, lncRNAs have emerged as novel diagnostic and prognostic biomarkers for TNBC treatment. However, the underlying mechanism through which lncRNAs perform their actions remains unclear, and extensive research is being carried out to reveal it. Therefore, understanding of mechanisms regulating the modulation of lncRNAs will be a substantial breakthrough in effective treatment therapies for TNBC. This review highlights the association of several lncRNAs in TNBC progression and treatment, along with their possible functions and mechanisms.

Recently, long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) have become the key gene regulators and prognostic biomarkers in various cancers. Through microarray data, Linc00339 was identified as a candidate oncogenic lncRNA. We compared the expression levels of Linc00339 in several breast cancer cell lines and normal mammary gland epithelial cell line. The effects of Linc00339 on tumor progression were examined both in vitro and in vivo. 3-(4,5-Dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide assays were applied to evaluate the functions of Linc00339, miR-377-3p, and HOXC6 on cell proliferation. Flow cytometry analysis was used to detect apoptosis and cell cycle distribution. Overall survival (OS) was analyzed using data from The Cancer Genome Atlas and molecular taxonomy of breast cancer international consortium (METABRIC). Dual luciferase assay and RNA immunoprecipitation were performed to confirm the interaction between Linc003339 and miR-377-3p. Linc00339 was increased in breast cancer cell lines compared with the normal epithelial cell. Through in vitro and in vivo experiments, Linc00339 overexpression promoted triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) proliferation, inhibited cell cycle arrest, and suppressed apoptosis. Silencing of Linc00339 obtained the opposite effects. Mechanistic investigations demonstrated that Linc00339 could sponge miR-377-3p and regulate its expression. Higher expression of miR-377-3p indicated longer OS in breast cancer patients, especially in TNBC patients. Overexpression of miR-377-3p retarded TNBC cell growth through regulating cell cycle distribution and apoptosis. And miR-377-3p was involved in Linc00339-mediated TNBC proliferation through regulating HOXC6 expression. Knockdown of HOXC6 inhibited TNBC progression. In conclusion, our results illuminated that the novel Linc00339/miR-377-3p/HOXC6 axis played a critical role in TNBC progression and might be a promising therapeutic target for TNBC treatment.

Long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) have emerged as potential prognostic markers in various human cancers as they participate in many malignant behaviors. However, the value of lncRNAs as prognostic markers among diverse human cancers is still under investigation, and a systematic signature based on these transcripts that related to pan-cancer prognosis has yet to be reported. In this study, we proposed a framework to incorporate statistical power, biological rationale, and machine learning models for pan-cancer prognosis analysis. The framework identified a 5-lncRNA signature (ENSG00000206567, PCAT29, ENSG00000257989, LOC388282, and LINC00339) from TCGA training studies (n = 1,878). The identified lncRNAs are significantly associated (all P ≤ 1.48E-11) with overall survival (OS) of the TCGA cohort (n = 4,231). The signature stratified the cohort into low- and high-risk groups with significantly distinct survival outcomes (median OS of 9.84 years versus 4.37 years, log-rank P = 1.48E-38) and achieved a time-dependent ROC/AUC of 0.66 at 5 years. After routine clinical factors involved, the signature demonstrated better performance for long-term prognostic estimation (AUC of 0.72). Moreover, the signature was further evaluated on two independent external cohorts (TARGET, n = 1,122; CPTAC, n = 391; National Cancer Institute) which yielded similar prognostic values (AUC of 0.60 and 0.75; log-rank P = 8.6E-09 and P = 2.7E-06). An indexing system was developed to map the 5-lncRNA signature to prognoses of pan-cancer patients. In silico functional analysis indicated that the lncRNAs are associated with common biological processes driving human cancers. The five lncRNAs, especially ENSG00000206567, ENSG00000257989 and LOC388282 that never reported before, may serve as viable molecular targets common among diverse cancers.

Emerging evidence have demonstrated that long noncoding RNAs are involved in the development and metastasis of various cancers including hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). However, the role of LINC00339 in HCC progression is still unknown. The LINC00339 expression in HCC cancer cells (HUH7, HepG2, HUH-6, and SK-Hep-1) and tissues was assessed by quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR). Functional experiments including cell counting Kit-8 wound-healing assay and transwell assay were used to explore the cell proliferation, migration, and invasion, respectively. The related molecular mechanisms were determined by Western blot. The RNA pull-down assay, luciferase reporters assay, qRT-PCR, and Western blot were performed to explore and confirm the interaction between LINC00339 and miR-152, between miR-152 and ROCK1. The role of LINC00339 in tumor formation and metastasis were explored through in vivo experiments. LINC00339 was highly expressed in HCC tissues and cell lines. LINC00339 promoted the cell proliferation, migration, and invasion of HCC cells, while knockout of LINC00339 showed the opposite trends. The proliferation and migration of HCC cells induced by LINC00339 overexpression were mostly reversed after transfected with miR-152 mimics. LINC00339 exerted oncogenesis effect on HCC progression by targeting miR-152/ROCK1, and the expression of LINC00339 was negatively correlated with miR-152 expression and positively correlated with ROCK1 expression in clinical HCC samples. Moreover, we also proved that LINC00339 overexpression exacerbated the tumor formation and metastases in nude mice and LINC00339 silence showed the opposite results. LINC00339 might act as a potential therapeutic target for HCC.

Glioma is recognized as a highly angiogenic malignant brain tumor. Vasculogenic mimicry (VM) greatly restricts the therapeutic effect of anti-angiogenic tumor therapy for glioma patients. However, the molecular mechanisms of VM formation in glioma remain unclear. Here, we demonstrated that LINC00339 was upregulated in glioma tissue as well as in glioma cell lines. The expression of LINC00339 in glioma tissues was positively correlated with glioma VM formation. Knockdown of LINC00339 inhibited glioma cell proliferation, migration, invasion, and tube formation, meanwhile downregulating the expression of VM-related molecular MMP-2 and MMP-14. Furthermore, knockdown of LINC00339 significantly increased the expression of miR-539-5p. Both bioinformatics and luciferase reporter assay revealed that LINC00339 regulated the above effects via binding to miR-539-5p. Besides, overexpression of miR-539-5p resulted in decreased expression of TWIST1, a transcription factor known to play an oncogenic role in glioma and identified as a direct target of miR-539-5p. TWIST1 upregulated the promoter activities of MMP-2 and MMP-14. The in vivo study showed that nude mice carrying tumors with knockdown of LINC00339 and overexpression of miR-539-5p exhibited the smallest tumor volume through inhibiting VM formation. In conclusion, LINC00339 may be used as a novel therapeutic target for VM formation in glioma.

Laryngeal squamous cell carcinoma (LSCC) is a very common neoplasm of the head and neck in the world. Long noncoding RNAs play key roles in cell infiltration, fate, apoptosis, and invasion. However, the functional role and expression of LINC00339 remains unclear in LSCC. In this study, we showed that the expression level of LINC00339 was upregulated in LSCC tissues and cell lines. LINC00339 silencing suppressed the proliferation, invasion, and epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) progression of LSCC cells. In addition, we showed that LINC00339 acted as a sponge of miR-145, and LINC00339 silencing promoted the expression of miR-145 in Hep2 cell. Furthermore, the expression of miR-145 was lower in LSCC tissues than in their paired normal samples and the miR-145 expression level was negatively correlated with LINC00339 expression in LSCC tissues. The knockdown of miR-145 promoted the proliferation, invasion, and EMT progression of LSCC cells. Finally, we indicated that LINC00339 silencing inhibited the proliferation, invasion, and EMT progression of LSCC cells by suppressing the miR-145 expression. These data suggested that LINC00339 acted as an oncogene in the development of LSCC, partly by regulating the miR-145 expression.

Non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) is one of leading causes of cancer-related death worldwide. Long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) has been identified to modulate the tumorigenesis of NSCLC. However, the precise molecular mechanism of lncRNAs in the course is still unclear. Results showed that LINC00339 was significantly up-regulated in NSCLC tissue and cells, which indicated the poor prognosis of NSCLC patients. Loss-of-function experiments showed that LINC00339 silencing inhibited the proliferation and invasion, accelerated the apoptosis, and suppressed the tumor growth of NSCLC cells in vitro and in vivo. Luciferase reporter assay and RNA immunoprecipitation (RIP) revealed that LINC00339 promoted the NSCLC progression via FOXM1 via targeting miR-145. In conclusion, our results identify the important role of the LINC00339/miR-145/FOXM1 axis in the NSCLC tumorigenesis, providing neoteric mechanism for the NSCLC tumorigenesis.

Differential expression of <i>LINC00339</i> is involved in the malignancy of multiple human cancer types. Nonetheless, the expression profile, functions, and potential mechanisms of action of <i>LINC00339</i> in gastric cancer are yet to be fully elucidated. This study aimed at measuring <i>LINC00339</i> expression in gastric cancer and examining the prognostic significance of <i>LINC00339</i> in patients with gastric cancer. The detailed functions of <i>LINC00339</i> with regard to the aggressive characteristics of gastric cancer cells and the underlying molecular mechanisms were investigated. Here, we found that <i>LINC00339</i> expression was aberrantly high in gastric cancer and significantly associated with lymph node metastasis, invasive depth, and TNM stage. Patients with gastric cancer in a <i>LINC00339</i> high-expression group showed shorter overall survival than patients in a <i>LINC00339</i> low-expression group. A knockdown of <i>LINC00339</i> suppressed gastric cancer cell proliferation, migration, and invasion and induced apoptosis in vitro and slowed tumor growth in vivo. In terms of the mechanism, <i>LINC00339</i> was found to act as a molecular sponge on microRNA-539 (miR-539). SRY-box 9 (<i>SOX9</i>) was confirmed as a direct target gene of miR-539 in gastric cancer cells. An miR-539 knockdown attenuated the effects of the <i>LINC00339</i> knockdown on the malignant characteristics of gastric cancer cells. Overall, <i>LINC00339</i> plays a critical role in the malignancy of gastric cancer by regulating <i>SOX9</i> via sponging of miR‑539. Our findings highlight the importance of the <i>LINC00339</i>-miR-539-SOX9 pathway in gastric cancer pathogenesis and may point to novel targets for the diagnosis, prognosis, and/or treatment of gastric cancer.

Accumulating evidence has indicated that long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) are pivotal regulators involved in the pathogenesis of cancer; however, the molecular mechanism of LINC00339 in colorectal cancer (CRC) remains unclear. The quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction for the expression of LINC00339 and miR-378a-3p and Western blots for <i>MED19</i> were performed. A dual-luciferase assay was used to investigate the interaction between LIN00339 and miR-378a-3p, as well as between miR-378a-3p and <i>MED19</i>. Cell proliferation was determined by 3-(4,5-dimethyl-2-thiazolyl)-2,5-diphenyl-2H-tetrazolium bromide (MTT) and 5-ethynyl-2'-deoxyuridine (EdU) assay. The cell cycle was analyzed by propidium iodide staining followed by flow cytometry analysis. The wound-healing and transwell invasion assays were used to evaluate cell migration and invasion. The expression of LINC00339 was significantly upregulated in CRC cells and tissues, and high LINC00339 expression indicated an advanced tumor stage. Further experiments demonstrated that <i>SP1</i> activated LINC00339 expression by binding to its promoter region. Luciferase activity and RNA pull-down assays demonstrated a direct interaction between LINC00339 and miR-378a-3p. miR-378a-3p expression was decreased in CRC samples and negatively correlated with LINC00339 expression in tumors. Gain- and loss-of-function assays indicated that LINC00339 contributed to cell proliferation, cell cycle progression, migration, and invasion, while miR-378a-3p reversed these effects. Furthermore, cotransfection of wild-type <i>MED19</i> 3'-UTR reporters and miR-378a-3p significantly reduced luciferase activity. <i>MED19</i> mRNA and protein expression was inhibited and enhanced by miR-378a-3p and LINC00339, respectively. <i>MED19</i> overexpression reversed the effect of miR-378a-3p on cellular processes. Moreover, LINC00339 promoted tumor growth in vivo and induced epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) and activated the Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway in cells. Our findings demonstrate the regulatory role of the SP1/LINC00339/miR-378a-3p/MED19 axis in CRC tumorigenesis and provide novel insight into the molecular mechanism underlying CRC.

Huaier, as known as <i>Trametes robiniophila</i> Murr, is a traditional Chinese medicine. Various studies have demonstrated that Huaier could inhibit cancer progression and improve the prognosis of patients. In the present study, we comprehensively screened the expression profiles of lncRNAs, miRNAs, and mRNAs in Huaier-treated breast cancer cells. Using bioinformatic analysis, hub genes were identified and functionally annotated. Weighted gene coexpression network analysis was applied to construct the molecular network influenced by Huaier. Linc00339 was then found to play a critical role in Huaier-mediated cancer suppression. To validate the effects of linc00339 and identify the downstream targets, we performed <i>in vitro</i> and <i>in vivo</i> experiments. Finally, we identified that Huaier could inhibit the proliferation of breast cancer cells through modulating linc00339/miR-4656/CSNK2B signaling pathway.
