Which antiepileptic drug is most strongly associated with spina bifida?

[PMID: 3939491]
A case control study on the association between maternal epilepsy, anticonvulsants use during pregnancy and birth defects was carried out in the Italian Multicentric Registry of Birth Defects (IPIMC). In the period 1980-1983, 7,607 malformed babies out of 439,717 total births (still + live) were registered. Fourty-one malformed babies with maternal epilepsy were identified (5.39 X 1,000). The overall relative risk of having a malformed baby among pregnant epileptic women was 1.87. Spina Bifida, Congenital Heart Defects, Clefts, Diaphragmatic Hernia and Trisomy 18 were more frequent than expected among babies with maternal epilepsy. The different therapeutic regimens were also tested to identify the possible independent teratogenic effect of anticonvulsants. A statistically significant association between Spina Bifida and Valproic Acid (odds ratio 22.7; Fisher p value = 0.0364) was observed: no other anticonvulsant tested showed any association with any type of malformation.

The teratogenicity of antiepilepsy drug valproic acid (VPA) mostly is found in genetic and somatic levels, causing teratogenesis involving neurotubular defects (NTDs), anencephaly, lumbosacral meningomyelocele, and leg dysfunction due to spina bifida aperta. A diversity of nutraceutics have been tried to alleviate the risk of VPA-teratogenicity. The effect was varying. In order to promote the preventive prescription, to find out its action mechanism can be rather crucial. We used chicken embryo model to try the effect of folic acid (FA), ascorbic acid (AA), and N-acetyl cysteine (NAC). VPA at 30mM showed the higher malformation rate (66.7%) with the least mortality (22.2%). Pathological findings indicated that the cervical muscle was more susceptible to VPA injury than the ankle muscle. VPA downregulated levels of superoxide dismutase (SOD), glutathione (GSH), histone deacetylase (HDAC) and folate, and upregulated H(2)O(2) and homocysteine. FA, AA, and NAC significantly upregulated SOD, but only AA alone activated GSH. AA and NAC downregulated H(2)O(2), while FA was totally ineffective. All three nutraceutics comparably rescued HDAC with simultaneously suppressed homocysteine accumulation and folate re-elevation, although less effectively by NAC. Based on these data, we conclude VPA possesses "Multiple Point Action Mechanism". In addition to affecting the cited transcription and translation levels, we hypothesize that VPA competitively antagonize the glutamic acid to couple with pteroic acid in biosynthesis of dihydrofolic acid (DHFA). H(2)O(2) directly destroyed the NADPH reducing system at dihydrofolate reductase (DHFR) and methylene tetrahydrofolate reductase (MTHFR) levels, while completely restored by AA, an implication in preservation of intact apoenzymes. In addition, the GSH-GSSG system is sandwiched between the reducing systems NADPH/NADP and DHA-AA, its net balance is highly dependent on in situ in vivo Redox state, hence folic acid transformation is varying. To rescue the VPA-induced teratogenicity, simultaneous multiple prescriptions are suggested.

Women with epilepsy giving birth during 1973 to 1991 were identified by record linkage of Swedish health registries. Among 3,625 identified infants, 9 had spina bifida. A nested case-control study was performed, comparing drugs used in early pregnancy in the 9 cases and in 18 controls, matched for year of delivery, maternal age, and parity. Six of the spina bifida mothers had used carbamazepine and two had used valproic acid. Among the controls, 5 women used carbamazepine and one valproic acid. There is an apparent excess risk for spina bifida after use of either of these two drugs, but it is not statistically significant when the analysis is restricted to drug-using women. The findings support earlier reports in the literature of an association between carbamazepine and spina bifida.

Fetal hydantoin syndrome is a rare disorder that is believed to be caused by exposure of a fetus to the anticonvulsant drug phenytoin. The classic features of fetal hydantoin syndrome include craniofacial anomalies, prenatal and postnatal growth deficiencies, underdeveloped nails of the fingers and toes, and mental retardation. Less frequently observed anomalies include cleft lip and palate, microcephaly, ocular defects, cardiovascular anomalies, hypospadias, umbilical and inguinal hernias, and significant developmental delays. Anaesthesia for incidental surgery in such a patient poses unique challenges for the anesthesiologist. We report the successful management of a 4-year-old male child with fetal hydantoin syndrome, cleft palate, spina bifida, atrial septal defect, and dextrocardia for tibialis anterior lengthening under subarachnoid block.

Fetal exposure to valproic acid or carbamazepine increases the risk of neural tube defect (NTD). The risk of a mother having a baby with spina bifida has been estimated at 1-2 p. 100, close to the rate of risk of recurrent cases. No study has evaluated the effect of folic acid in neonates of women treated with valproic acid or carbamazepine although the protective effect against NTD has been proven in other populations. Periconceptional folic acid supplementation, 0.4 to 1 mg/day, for at least one month prior to conception and until the date of the second missed menstrual period or later decreases the incidence of a first occurrence of neural tube defect. Periconceptional folic acid supplementation, 4 mg/day, decreases the recurrence of NTD in women who had previously had a child with NTD. It seems pertinent to recommend periconceptional folic acid supplementation in women treated with carbamazepine or valporic acid. There are very few data in women on which to base a decision to advise taking 4 mg/day (as used in recurrence prevention) or low doses of 0.4 mg/day (used in primary prevention).

Valproic acid, a drug commonly used to treat seizures and other psychiatric disorders, causes neural tube defects (NTDs) in exposed fetuses at a rate 20 times higher than in the general population. Failure of the neural tube to close during development results in exencephaly or anencephaly, as well as spina bifida. In mice, nonspecific activation of the maternal immune system can reduce fetal abnormalities caused by diverse etiologies, including diabetes-induced NTDs. We hypothesized that nonspecific activation of the maternal immune system with interferon-gamma (IFN-gamma) and granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF) could reduce valproic acid (VA)-induced defects as well. Female CD-1 mice were given immune stimulant prebreeding: either IFN-gamma or GM-CSF. Approximately half of the control and immune-stimulated pregnant females were then exposed to 500 mg/kg VA on the morning of gestational day 8. The incidence of developmental defects was determined on gestational day 17 from at least eight litters in each of the following treatment groups: control, VA only, IFN-gamma only, IFN-gamma+VA, GM-CSF only, and GM-CSF+VA. The incidence of NTDs was 18% in fetuses exposed to VA alone, compared to 3.7% and 2.9% in fetuses exposed to IFN-gamma+VA, or GM-CSF+VA respectively. Ocular defects were also significantly reduced from 28.0% in VA exposed groups to 9.8% in IFN-gamma+VA and 12.5% in GM-CSF+VA groups. The mechanisms by which maternal immune stimulation prevents birth defects remain unclear, but may involve maternal or fetal production of cytokines or growth factors which protect the fetus from the dysregulatory effects of teratogens.

To investigate pregnancy, delivery, and child outcome in an unselected population of women with both treated and untreated epilepsy. In the compulsory Medical Birth Registry of Norway, all 2,861 deliveries by women with epilepsy recorded from 1999-2005 were compared to all 369,267 nonepilepsy deliveries in the same period. The majority (66%, n = 1900) in the epilepsy group did not use antiepileptic drugs (AEDs) during pregnancy. A total of 961 epilepsy-pregnancies were exposed to AEDs. Compared to nonepilepsy controls, AED-exposed infants were more often preterm (p = 0.01), and more often had birth weight <2,500 g (p < 0.001), head circumference <2.5 percentile (p < 0.001), and low Apgar score (p = 0.03). Small-for-gestational-age (SGA) infants (<10 percentile) occurred more frequently in both AED-exposed (p = 0.05) and unexposed (p = 0.02) epilepsy-pregnancies. Frequency of major congenital malformations (MCMs) was 2.8% (n = 81) in the epilepsy group versus 2.5% in controls (p = 0.3). Increased risk for MCMs could be demonstrated only for exposure to valproate (5.6%, p = 0.005) and AED polytherapy (6.1%, p = 0.02). Neonatal spina bifida was not significantly increased, but was a major indication for elective pregnancy termination among women with epilepsy. Cesarean section was performed more often in maternal epilepsy, regardless of AED-exposure (p < 0.001). Adverse pregnancy and birth outcome in women with epilepsy is mainly confined to AED-exposed pregnancies, although some risks are associated also with untreated epilepsy. The risk for congenital malformations was lower than previously reported. This could be due to a shift in AED selection, folic acid supplement, or possibly reflect the true risks in an unselected epilepsy population.

The study goal was to assess teratogenic effects of antiepileptic drugs (AEDs) through the use of a surveillance system (MADRE) of infants with malformations. Information on all malformed infants (1990-1996) with maternal first-trimester drug exposure was collected by the International Clearinghouse for Birth Defects and Monitoring Systems (ICBDMS). Cases were defined as infants presenting with a specific malformation, and controls were defined as infants presenting with any other birth defect. Exposure was defined by the use of AEDs during the first trimester of pregnancy. The association of AEDs with malformations was then estimated by calculating the odds ratios with 95% confidence intervals and testing their homogeneity among registries. Among 8005 cases of malformations, 299 infants were exposed in utero to AEDs. Of those exposed to monotherapy, 65 were exposed to phenobarbital, 10 to methylphenobarbital, 80 to valproic acid, 46 to carbamazepine, 24 to phenytoin, and 16 to other AEDs. Associations were found for spina bifida with valproic acid. Infants exposed to phenobarbital and to methylphenobarbital showed an increased risk of oral clefts. Cardiac malformations were found to be associated with phenobarbital, methylphenobarbital, valproic acid, and carbamazepine. Hypospadias was associated with valproic acid. Porencephaly and other specified anomalies of brain, anomalies of face, coarctation of aorta, and limb reduction defects were found to be associated with valproic acid. Using the MADRE system, we confirmed known teratogenic effects of AEDs. We also found increased risks for malformations that had never been reported associated with AEDs or for which the association was suggested by case reports.

The distribution of anticonvulsant drug therapy was studied in 318 malformed infants with known histories of maternal epilepsy. Data on the infants was collected from six birth defect monitoring programs in Europe and South America. Use of specific types of anticonvulsants varies widely among reporting countries. Heterogeneity of drug-malformation distribution, was analyzed to determine whether use of specific drugs were linked to specific malformations. A significant association was seen between maternal use of valproic acid and spina bifida, and a weaker, non-significant one between carbamazepine and spina bifida. Facial clefts were associated with both diphenylhydantoin and phenobarbitone use and also with polytherapy. These differences indicate that the actual drug used is significant for the teratogenic process. The technique may be useful in analysis of other drug-related teratogenic questions.

Selected antiepileptic drugs (AEDs) increase the risk of birth defects. To assess the impact of influencing AED prescribing practices on spina bifida and cleft palate we searched the literature for estimates of the association between valproic acid or carbamazepine use during pregnancy and these defects and summarized the associations using meta-analyses. We estimated distributions of the prevalence of valproic acid and carbamazepine use among women of childbearing age based on analyses of four data sets. We estimated the attributable fractions and the number of children born with each defect that could be prevented annually in the United States if valproic acid and carbamazepine were not used during pregnancy. The summary odds ratio estimate for the association between valproic acid and spina bifida was 11.9 (95% uncertainty interval (UI): 4.0-21.2); for valproic acid and cleft palate 5.8 (95% UI: 3.3-9.5); for carbamazepine and spina bifida 3.6 (95% UI: 1.3-7.8); and for carbamazepine and cleft palate 2.4 (95% UI: 1.1-4.5) in the United States. Approximately 40 infants (95% UI: 10-100) with spina bifida and 35 infants (95% UI: 10-70) with cleft palate could be born without these defects each year if valproic acid were not used during pregnancy; 5 infants (95% UI: 0-15) with spina bifida and 5 infants (95% UI: 0-15) with cleft palate could be born without these defects each year if carbamazepine were not used during pregnancy. This modeling approach could be extended to other medications to estimate the impact of translating pharmacoepidemiologic data to evidence-based prenatal care practice.
