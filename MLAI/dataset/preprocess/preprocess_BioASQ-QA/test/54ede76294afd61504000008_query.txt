What is the risk of developing acute myelogenous leukemia in Fanconi anemia?

[PMID: 8068955]
We analyzed data from 388 subjects with Fanconi anemia reported to the International Fanconi Anemia Registry (IFAR). Of those, 332 developed hematologic abnormalities at a median age of 7 years (range, birth to 31 years). Actuarial risk of developing hematopoietic abnormalities was 98% (95% confidence interval, 93% to 99%) by 40 years of age. Common hematologic abnormalities were thrombocytopenia and pancytopenia. These were often associated with decreased bone marrow (BM) cellularity (75% of cases studied). Clonal cytogenetic abnormalities developed in 23 of 68 persons with BM failure who had adequate studies. Actuarial risk of clonal cytogenetic abnormalities during BM failure was 67% (47% to 87%) by 30 years of age. Fifty-nine subjects developed myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) or acute myelogenous leukemia (AML). Actuarial risk of MDS or AML was 52% (37% to 67%) by 40 years of age. Risk was higher in persons with than in those without a prior clonal cytogenetic abnormality (3% [0% to 9%] v 35% [0% to 79%]; P = .006). One hundred twenty persons died of hematologic causes including BM failure, MDS or AML and treatment related complications. Actuarial risk of death from hematologic causes was 81% (67% to 90%) by 40 years of age.

Fanconi anemia (FA) is a genetically and phenotypically heterogeneous disorder defined by cellular hypersensitivity to DNA cross-linking agents; mutations in the gene defective in FA complementation group C, FAC, are responsible for the syndrome in a subset of patients. We have performed an analysis of the clinical effects of specific mutations in the FAC gene. Using the amplification refractory mutation system assays that we developed to rapidly detect FAC mutations, at least one mutated copy of the FAC gene was identified in 59 FA patients from the International Fanconi Anemia Registry (IFAR). This represents 15% of the 397 FA patients tested. FA-C patients were divided into three subgroups based on results of a genotype-phenotype analysis using the Cox proportional hazards model: (1) patients with the IVS4 mutation (n = 26); (2) patients with at least one exon 14 mutation (R548X or L554P) (n = 16); and (3) patients with at least one exon 1 mutation (322delG or Q13X) and no known exon 14 mutation (n = 17). Kaplan-Meier analysis shows that IVS4 or exon 14 mutations define poor risk subgroups, as they are associated with significantly earlier onset of hematologic abnormalities and poorer survival compared to exon 1 patients and to the non-FA-C IFAR population. There was no direct correlation between the degree of cellular hypersensitivity to the clastogenic effect of diepoxybutane and severity of clinical phenotype. Sixteen of the 59 FA-C patients (27%) have developed acute myelogenous leukemia. Thirteen of these patients have died; AML was the cause of death in 46% of the expired FA-C patients. This study enables us to define this clinically heterogeneous disorder genotypically to better predict clinical outcome and aid decision-making regarding major therapeutic modalities for a subset of FA patients.

A review of all of the cases of Fanconi anemia (FA) reported to the International Fanconi Anemia Registry (IFAR) indicates that at least 15% manifest acute myelogenous leukemia (AML) or preleukemia. These patients usually have karyotypically abnormal bone marrow clones, but do not exhibit chromosomal translocations involving breakpoints associated with specific oncogenes; leukemia in FA is more likely to be a multi-step process than a single step transformation. The cellular defect in FA results in chromosomal instability, hypersensitivity to DNA damage, and hypermutability for allele-loss mutations. An update of current research to identify the molecular defect in FA is presented. Characterization of the FA genes should further our understanding of the etiology of leukemia.
