This overview is aimed at reevaluating fundamental approaches of current MS therapies with focus being placed on their targeted underlying immune, molecular and cellular mechanisms. Currently used therapies are discussed in regard to their mechanisms of action, clinical accomplishments and unwanted side effects and complications. Special emphasis is given to the current first generation Disease Modifying Therapies (DMT) and their actions at immune mechanisms of disease. Effects of DMT on CD4+Th1 cells and their associated cytokines and signaling pathways are discussed in more detail. Attention is paid to emerging role of a CD4 T cell chemotactic cytokine, IL-16 in regulation of relapsing MS and its model, experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE). Immune mechanisms mediated by IL-16 are critically evaluated in the context of mechanisms of DMT and its potential as prospective MS therapy. In relation to clinical assessment of therapy, existing and prospective molecular biomarkers are highlighted and discussed where applicable.

CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells, especially T-helper (Th) cells (Th1, Th2 and Th17) and regulatory T cells (Treg) play pivotal role in the pathogenesis of multiple sclerosis (MS), a demyelinating autoimmune disease occurring in central nervous system (CNS). Astragaloside IV (ASI, CAS: 84687-43-4) is one of the saponins isolated from Astragalus membranceus, a traditional Chinese medicine with immunomodulatory effect. So far, whether ASI has curative effect on experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE), an animal model of MS, and how it affects the subsets of CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells, as well as the underlying mechanism have not been clearly elucidated. In the present study, ASI was found to ameliorate the progression and hamper the recurrence of EAE effectively in the treatment regimens. It significantly reduced the demyelination and inflammatory infiltration of CNS in EAE mice by suppressing the percentage of Th1 and Th17 cells, which was closely associated with the inhibition of JAK/STAT and NF-κB signaling pathways. ASI also increased the percentage of Treg cells in spleen and CNS, which was accompanied by elevated Foxp3. However, in vitro experiments disclosed that ASI could regulate the differentiation of Th17 and Treg cells but not Th1 cells. In addition, it induced the apoptosis of MOG-stimulated CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells probably through modulating STAT3/Bcl-2/Bax signaling pathways. Together, our findings suggested that ASI can modulate the differentiation of autoreactive CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells and is a potential prodrug or drug for the treatment of MS and other similar autoimmune diseases.

Multiple sclerosis (MS) is believed to be initiated when myelin-specific T cells infiltrate the central nervous system (CNS), triggering subsequent recruitment of inflammatory leukocytes to the CNS. The contribution of neutrophils to CNS autoimmune disease has been underappreciated, but several studies in experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE), an animal model of MS, indicate that neutrophils have an important role in inflammation. Neutrophils are hypothesized to contribute to the pathogenesis of EAE by producing cytokines and promoting breakdown of the blood brain barrier. Neutrophils may also influence the manifestation of EAE by facilitating parenchymal brain inflammation. This review summarizes evidence supporting a functional role for neutrophils in EAE and MS, highlighting the differential regulation of neutrophil recruitment in the brain and spinal cord.

It has been shown that calcitriol and all-trans retinoic acid (ATRA) have modulatory effects on the immune system. The present study investigates the synergistic effects of combination treatment of calcitriol and ATRA in experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE), an animal model of multiple sclerosis (MS). The mice were allocated to four preventive groups, each consisting of eight animals, ATRA (250 μg/mouse), calcitriol (100 ng/mouse), combination of ATRA and calcitriol (125  μg/mouse and 50 ng/mouse) and vehicle groups. EAE was induced by MOG35-55 peptide in female C57BL/6 mice. Treatments were initiated at day 1 before immunization and continued every other day throughout the study until the day 21 post-immunization. Splenocytes were isolated from EAE-induced mice and the expression of retinoic acid receptor-related orphan receptor gamma t (ROR-γt), Interleukin-17 (IL-17), transforming growth factor beta (TGF-β), and forkhead box P3 (FOXP3) genes was measured using real-time polymerase chain reaction. The expression of FOXP3 and TGF-β genes in the splenocytes of combination-treated and calcitriol alone-treated mice was significantly increased compared to vehicle group (P < 0.05). The expression of ROR-γt and IL-17 genes in the splenocytes of ATRA, calcitriol and combination- treated mice was significantly reduced compared to those of vehicle- treated mice (P < 0.05). The relative expression level of ROR-γt was significantly (P < 0.05) lower in the combination group than in the mice treated by ATRA or calcitriol alone. This study demonstrated that treatment with combination of calcitriol and ATRA can be considered as a new strategy for MS prevention and treatment.
