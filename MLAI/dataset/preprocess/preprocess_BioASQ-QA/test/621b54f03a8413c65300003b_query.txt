Where are the PUX proteins found?

[PMID: 32601292]
The inner nuclear membrane (INM) selectively accumulates proteins that are essential for nuclear functions; however, overaccumulation of INM proteins results in a range of rare genetic disorders. So far, little is known about how defective, mislocalized, or abnormally accumulated membrane proteins are actively removed from the INM, especially in plants and animals. Here, via analysis of a proximity-labeling proteomic profile of INM-associated proteins in Arabidopsis, we identify critical components for an INM protein degradation pathway. We show that this pathway relies on the CDC48 complex for INM protein extraction and 26S proteasome for subsequent protein degradation. Moreover, we show that CDC48 at the INM may be regulated by a subgroup of PUX proteins, which determine the substrate specificity or affect the ATPase activity of CDC48. These PUX proteins specifically associate with the nucleoskeleton underneath the INM and physically interact with CDC48 proteins to negatively regulate INM protein degradation in plants.

In plants, AAA-adenosine triphosphatase (ATPase) Cell Division Control Protein 48 (CDC48) uses the force generated through ATP hydrolysis to pull, extract, and unfold ubiquitylated or sumoylated proteins from the membrane, chromatin, or protein complexes. The resulting changes in protein or RNA content are an important means for plants to control protein homeostasis and thereby adapt to shifting environmental conditions. The activity and targeting of CDC48 are controlled by adaptor proteins, of which the plant ubiquitin regulatory X (UBX) domain-containing (PUX) proteins constitute the largest family. Emerging knowledge on the structure and function of PUX proteins highlights that these proteins are versatile factors for plant homeostasis and adaptation that might inspire biotechnological applications.
