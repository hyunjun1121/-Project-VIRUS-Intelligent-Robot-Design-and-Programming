A dysfunctional glutamatergic system is thought to be central to the negative symptoms and cognitive deficits recognized as determinant to the poor quality of life of people with schizophrenia. Modulating glutamate uptake has, thus, been suggested as a novel target for antipsychotics. Alstonine is an indole alkaloid sharing with atypical antipsychotics the profile in animal models relevant to schizophrenia, though divergent in its mechanism of action. The aim of this study was to evaluate the effects of alstonine on glutamate uptake. Additionally, the effects on glutathione content and extracellular S100B levels were assessed. Acute hippocampal slices were incubated with haloperidol (10μM), clozapine (10 and 100μM) or alstonine (1-100μM), alone or in combination with apomorphine (100μM), and 5-HT(2) receptor antagonists (0.01μM altanserin and 0.1μM SB 242084). A reduction in glutamate uptake was observed with alstonine and clozapine, but not haloperidol. Apomorphine abolished the effect of clozapine, whereas 5-HT(2A) and 5-HT(2C) antagonists abolished the effects of alstonine. Increased levels of glutathione were observed only with alstonine, also the only compound that failed to decrease the release of S100B. This study shows that alstonine decreases glutamate uptake, which may be beneficial to the glutamatergic deficit observed in schizophrenia. Noteworthily, the decrease in glutamate uptake is compatible with the reversal of MK-801-induced social interaction and working memory deficits. An additional potential benefit of alstonine as an antipsychotic is its ability to increase glutathione, a key cellular antioxidant reported to be decreased in the brain of patients with schizophrenia. Adding to the characterization of the novel mechanism of action of alstonine, the lack of effect of apomorphine in alstonine-induced changes in glutamate uptake reinforces that D(2) receptors are not primarily implicated. Though clearly mediated by 5-HT(2A) and 5-HT(2C) serotonin receptors, the precise mechanisms that result in the effects of alstonine on glutamate uptake warrant elucidation.

The aim of the present study is to describe and validate a method for accurate quantification of 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT)(2A) receptors using [18F]altanserin-positron emission tomography (PET) and the bolus/infusion approach. A bolus/infusion ratio of 1.75 h aimed at attaining rapid steady state in blood and brain was predicted from previous bolus studies performed in our laboratory. The infusion schedule was tested in normal subjects (n = 10) using dynamic PET and frequent plasma sampling for 6 h. Steady state was attained in brain and plasma within 2 h, and time-activity curves remained constant for another 3 h. To represent free and nonspecifically bound [18F]altanserin and its radiolabeled metabolites only, cerebellum must show no displacement in 5-HT(2A) displacement studies. To validate this, saturating doses of cold ketanserin were administered and it was found that specific binding of [18F]altanserin decreased uniformly to the level of the cerebellum and no change in the cerebellar time-activity curve was found after ketanserin administration. A shorter experimental setup was tested in a second group (n = 20) including patients with neuropsychiatric disorders. Dynamic PET (five frames of 8 minutes each) and venous blood sampling at midscan time started 2 h after [18F]altanserin administration. The mean percentage rate of change per hour in the outcome parameter, DV(3)', was low (mean -0.3% h-1; range -7.3-7.2% h-1) and no correlation of DV(3)' versus time was demonstrated. It is concluded that 5-HT(2A) receptor studies can be conducted within 2 h of [18F]altanserin infusion, yielding reliable results.

To study the 5-HT(2A) receptors in the living human brain, using positron emission tomography (PET), two selective radiotracers are currently in use: [(18)F]altanserin and [(11)C]MDL 100907. It is, however, currently unknown to what extent data obtained with either tracer are directly comparable. The aim of this study was to compare binding characteristics of these two radiotracers in rat brain with respect to affinity (K(d)), receptor binding density (B(max)), binding potential (BP), and nonspecific binding. Further, binding kinetics, sensitivity towards competition with the endogenous transmitter serotonin, and the competitive/noncompetitive interaction between the two radioligands were evaluated. In addition, the selectivity of [(18)F]altanserin for the 5-HT(2A) receptor was assessed. The K(d) value of [(18)F]altanserin and [(3)H]MDL 100907 was in the order of 0.3 nM. B(max) in frontal cortex was 523 and 527 fmol/mg protein, respectively. The binding of [(18)F]altanserin was not influenced by blocking either the 5-HT(2B/2C) or the alpha(1)-adrenergic receptors. At 37 degrees C the association t(1/2) was 2.8 and 2.7 min and the dissociation t(1/2) was 11 and 13.5 min for [(18)F]altanserin and [(3)H]MDL 100907, respectively. Both radioligands were displaced by 5-HT, only at high concentrations; the K(i) value of 5-HT ranging between 650 and 3,300 nM. This indicates that binding of both radioligands in PET studies is not directly influenced by changes in endogenous 5-HT.Overall, the binding of [(18)F]altanserin and [(3)H]MDL 100907 to the 5-HT(2A) receptor was very comparable, showing selective high affinity binding in the subnanomolar range.

The serotonin 2A (5-HT2A) receptor has been implicated in neural-processing of emotionally salient information. To elucidate its role in processing of fear and anger, healthy individuals were studied with functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) after 5-HT2A receptor blockade, while judging the gender of neutral, fearful and angry faces. 5-HT2A receptors were blocked with ketanserin to a variable degree across subjects by adjusting the time between ketanserin-infusion and onset of the fMRI protocol. Neocortical 5-HT2A receptor binding in terms of the binding potential (BPp ) was assessed prior to fMRI with (18)F-altanserin positron emission tomography (PET) and subsequently integrated in the fMRI data analysis. Also functional connectivity analysis was employed to evaluate the effect of ketanserin blocking on connectivity. Compared to a control session, 5-HT2A receptor blockade reduced the neural response to fearful faces in the medial orbitofrontal cortex (OFC), independently of 5-HT2A receptor occupancy or neocortical 5-HT2A receptor BPp . The medial OFC also showed increased functional coupling with the left amygdala during processing of fearful faces depending on the amount of blocked 5-HT2A receptors. 5-HT2A receptor mediated signaling increases the sensitivity of the OFC to fearful facial expressions and regulates the strength of a negative feedback signal from the OFC to amygdala during processing of fearful faces.

The feasibility of in vivo serotonin 5HT(2) receptor binding measurement using [18F]altanserin as a radioligand has been well established. In this study, the postsynaptic receptor binding potential of this ligand was examined as a possible indicator of synaptic serotonin content after pharmacological challenge. Studies were performed in 11 subjects with a history of recurrent major depression. Six of them received serotonergic antidepressive treatment at the time of the experiment, the other five patients were untreated. Two PET measurements were carried out in each subject within 2 or 3 days. Before one of the measurements, 25 mg of the serotonin re-uptake inhibitor clomipramine were given intravenously, the other measurement was done without pharmacological challenge. The data were analyzed using non-linear least-square regression and Logan's graphical method. In the whole group of subjects, binding potential and distribution volume of altanserin decreased following clomipramine challenge. The decrease was between 14 (P=0.03) and 23% (P=0.004). This effect was mainly seen in subjects not on antidepressive medication. Clomipramine challenge probably increased the synaptic serotonin level, which competed with altanserin leading to the lowered binding potential. The paradigm might, thus, be useful to estimate serotonin release in vivo. Pretreatment with serotonergic antidepressants reduces the effect of clomipramine.

To determine the reproducibility of measurements of brain 5-HT2A receptors with an [18F]altanserin PET bolus/infusion approach. Further, to estimate the sample size needed to detect regional differences between two groups and, finally, to evaluate how partial volume correction affects reproducibility and the required sample size. For assessment of the variability, six subjects were investigated with [18F]altanserin PET twice, at an interval of less than 2 weeks. The sample size required to detect a 20% difference was estimated from [18F]altanserin PET studies in 84 healthy subjects. Regions of interest were automatically delineated on co-registered MR and PET images. In cortical brain regions with a high density of 5-HT2A receptors, the outcome parameter (binding potential, BP1) showed high reproducibility, with a median difference between the two group measurements of 6% (range 5-12%), whereas in regions with a low receptor density, BP1 reproducibility was lower, with a median difference of 17% (range 11-39%). Partial volume correction reduced the variability in the sample considerably. The sample size required to detect a 20% difference in brain regions with high receptor density is approximately 27, whereas for low receptor binding regions the required sample size is substantially higher. This study demonstrates that [18F]altanserin PET with a bolus/infusion design has very low variability, particularly in larger brain regions with high 5-HT2A receptor density. Moreover, partial volume correction considerably reduces the sample size required to detect regional changes between groups.

We previously demonstrated a 20-30% reduction in cortical 5-HT2A receptor binding in patients with mild cognitive impairment (MCI) as compared to healthy subjects. Here we present a two-year follow-up of 14 patients and 12 healthy age-matched subjects. Baseline and follow-up partial volume corrected levels of 5-HT2A in four neocortical lobes and the posterior cingulate gyrus were investigated using [18F]altanserin positron emission tomography with a bolus-infusion approach. In the two-year follow-up period, 8 of 14 patients with MCI had progressed to fulfill diagnostic criteria for probable Alzheimer's disease (AD). In both patients and healthy subjects, no significant change in 5-HT2A receptor binding was found as compared to baseline values. In MCI patients, the average BPP in neocortex ranged from 1.49 to 2.45 at baseline and 1.38 to 2.29 at two-year follow-up; and in healthy subjects BPP ranged from 1.85 to 3.10 at baseline and 1.81 to 2.98 at two-year follow-up. The BPP of the patients that converted to AD during the follow-up period did not differ significantly from the patients that had not (yet) converted, neither at baseline, nor at follow-up. We conclude that the reduced levels of 5-HT2A receptor binding in MCI patients decrease only slowly and non-significantly, even in patients who convert to AD. Our finding suggests that profoundly reduced cortical 5-HT2A receptor binding is an early feature in MCI whereas the clinical progression from MCI to AD is less associated with further decrease in binding.

Serotoninergic type 2 (5HT2) receptors have been implicated in the regulation of many brain functions in humans and may play a role in several neurological and psychiatric diseases. Fluorine-18 altanserin has been proposed as a new radiotracer for the study of 5HT2 receptors by PET because of its high affinity for 5HT2 receptors (Ki: 0.13 nM) and its good specificity in in vitro studies. Dynamic PET studies were carried out in 12 healthy volunteers after intravenous injection of 0.1 mCi/kg [18F]altanserin. Ninety minutes after injection, we observed mainly cortical binding. Basal ganglia and cerebellum showed very low uptake and the frontal cortex to cerebellum ratio was about 3. To evaluate the quantitative distribution of this ligand in the brain, we used two different methods of data analysis: a four-compartment model was used to achieve quantitative evaluation of rate constants (K1 and k2 through k6) by non-linear regression, and a multiple-time graphical analysis technique for reversible binding was employed for the measurement of k1/k2 and k3/k4 ratios. Using both methods, we found significant differences in binding capacity (estimated by k3/k4 = Bmax/Kd) between regions, the values increasing as follows: occipital, limbic, parietal, frontal and temporal cortex. After correction of values obtained by the graphical method for the existence of non-specific binding, results generated by the two methods were consistent.

The selective 5-hydroxytryptamine type 2a receptor (5-HT(2A)R) radiotracer [(18)F]altanserin is a promising ligand for in vivo brain imaging in rodents. However, [(18)F]altanserin is a substrate of P-glycoprotein (P-gp) in rats. Its applicability might therefore be constrained by both a differential expression of P-gp under pathological conditions, e.g. epilepsy, and its relatively low cerebral uptake. The aim of the present study was therefore twofold: (i) to investigate whether inhibition of multidrug transporters (MDT) is suitable to enhance the cerebral uptake of [(18)F]altanserin in vivo and (ii) to test different pharmacokinetic, particularly reference tissue-based models for exact quantification of 5-HT(2A)R densities in the rat brain. Eighteen Sprague-Dawley rats, either treated with the MDT inhibitor cyclosporine A (CsA, 50 mg/kg, n=8) or vehicle (n=10) underwent 180-min PET scans with arterial blood sampling. Kinetic analyses of tissue time-activity curves (TACs) were performed to validate invasive and non-invasive pharmacokinetic models. CsA application lead to a two- to threefold increase of [(18)F]altanserin uptake in different brain regions and showed a trend toward higher binding potentials (BP(ND)) of the radioligand. MDT inhibition led to an increased cerebral uptake of [(18)F]altanserin but did not improve the reliability of BP(ND) as a non-invasive estimate of 5-HT(2A)R. This finding is most probable caused by the heterogeneous distribution of P-gp in the rat brain and its incomplete blockade in the reference region (cerebellum). Differential MDT expressions in experimental animal models or pathological conditions are therefore likely to influence the applicability of imaging protocols and have to be carefully evaluated.

Although alterations of serotonin (5-HT) system functioning have been proposed for a variety of psychiatric disorders, a direct method quantitatively assessing 5-HT release capacity in the living human brain is still lacking. Therefore, we evaluated a novel method to assess 5-HT release capacity in vivo using dexfenfluramine challenge and [(18)F]altanserin positron emission tomography (PET). Thirteen healthy male subjects received placebo and single oral doses of 40 mg (n = 6) or 60 mg (n = 7) of the potent 5-HT releaser dexfenfluramine separated by an interval of 14 days. Three further subjects received placebo on both days. Two hours after placebo/drug administration, 250 MBq of the 5-HT(2A) receptor selective PET-radiotracer [(18)F]altanserin was administered intravenously as a 30s bolus. Dynamic PET data were subsequently acquired over 90 min. Moreover, arterial blood samples were drawn for measurement of total activity and metabolite correction of the input function. Dexfenfluramine as well as cortisol and prolactin plasma concentration-time profiles was quantitatively determined. Tracer distribution volumes for five volumes-of-interest (prefrontal and occipital cortex, insula, thalamus, caudatum) were calculated by the Logan plot and a 2-tissue compartment model. Dexfenfluramine dose-dependently decreased the total distribution volume of [(18)F]altanserin in cortical regions independent of the PET modeling approach. Cortisol and prolactin plasma concentrations were dose-dependently increased by dexfenfluramine. The decrease in cortical [(18)F]altanserin receptor binding under dexfenfluramine was correlated with the increase of plasma prolactin. These data suggest that the combination of a dexfenfluramine-induced 5-HT release and subsequent assessment of 5-HT(2A) receptor availability with [(18)F]altanserin PET is suitable to measure cortical 5-HT release capacity in the human brain.

We used [18F]altanserin and positron emission tomography (PET) to image serotonin 5-HT2A receptors in humans. The highest [18F]altanserin uptake is found in the cerebral cortex, with specific-to-nonspecific binding ratios varying from 0.53 to 1.91 in humans between 24 and 48 years of age. In all neocortical regions studied, [18F]altanserin uptake correlates negatively with age. No correlations were found between age and uptake in the cerebellum, the regional cerebral blood flow, or the time course of metabolization of [18F]altanserin. The reduction in cerebral 5-HT2A receptor binding thus directly reflects the loss of specific 5-HT2A receptors with age.

Blockade of 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT)(2A) receptors reportedly mediates or modulates the ability of isoflurane to produce immobility during noxious stimulation and would thereby influence MAC (the minimum alveolar concentration required to suppress movement in response to noxious stimulation in 50% of subjects). However, no data are yet available regarding the role of this receptor in the immobilizing action of sevoflurane. In this study, we examined how prior intraperitoneal administration of either the 5-HT(2A) receptor antagonist altanserin or the 5-HT(2C/2B) receptor antagonist SB 206553 might affect sevoflurane MAC in rats. Three groups of six male Wistar rats weighing 250-350 g each received one of the following drugs dissolved in dimethyl sulfoxide intraperitoneally 30 min before MAC testing: (1) altanserin 10 mg/kg; (2) SB 206553 10 mg/kg; (3) no drug (vehicle control). MAC was defined as the average of the concentrations that just prevented or just permitted movement in response to clamping the tail for 1 min. The rank order of MAC values obtained after intraperitoneal drug pretreatment and sevoflurane exposure was altanserin < SB 206553 < vehicle control. Considering the low levels of 5-HT(2B) receptors within the CNS, this result suggests that 5-HT(2A) and the 5-HT(2C) receptors are present within the neural circuitry influencing sevoflurane MAC. Blockade of 5-HT(2A) and/or 5-HT(2C) receptors may modulate the immobility produced by sevoflurane during noxious stimulation.

Behavioral and cellular studies indicate that serotonin interacting with the 5-HT2a receptor (5-HT2aR) is involved in cognitive processes supporting working memory (WM). However, 5-HT receptor neuroimaging studies directly relating WM-induced neuronal activations to concomitant changes in the availability of 5-HT receptors as a functional measure for serotonin release are lacking. This controlled cross-over PET study aimed to identify brain regions with WM-induced changes in the binding potential (BP(nd)) of the 5-HT2aR antagonist [(18)F]altanserin. Ten young males underwent a delayed match-to-sample task using photographs of faces and a control task. The BP(nd)s for both conditions were calculated by applying Ichise's noninvasive plot. Statistics were performed with the SPM toolbox statistical nonparametric mapping (SnPM3) particularly suited for analyzing whole-brain PET data in an exploratory way. A higher BP(nd) for [(18)F]altanserin during WM versus control was found in the orbitofrontal cortex (OFC) pointing towards an increased [(18)F]altanserin/5-HT2aR interaction in OFC while BP(nd) decreases during WM were not found. Furthermore, no BP(nd) changes in regions known from functional neuroimaging studies to be more specifically involved in WM were identified. These findings may suggest that the increased [(18)F]altanserin BP(nd) under WM challenge and hence the increased availability of 5-HT2aR reflects a decrease in local OFC serotonin. As the OFC plays a prominent role in decision-making and supports cognitive processes related to the central executive functions of WM it might be modulated by the serotoninergic system via the 5-HT2aR in order to support and optimize basic cognitive functions.

The serotonin 2A (5-HT(2A)) receptor is of interest in several psychiatric and neurological diseases. In the present study we investigated the longitudinal stability of 5-HT(2A) receptors and the stability of the quantification procedure in the elderly in order to be able to study elderly patients with neuropsychiatric diseases on a longitudinal basis. [(18)F]-Altanserin PET was used to quantify 5-HT(2A) receptors in 12 healthy elderly individuals at baseline and at 2 years in six volumes of interest. A bolus/infusion protocol was used to achieve the binding potential, BP(P). The reproducibility as assessed in terms of variability and the reliability as assessed in terms of intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC) were used to compare inter- and intraobserver stability and to evaluate the effects of increasing complexity of partial volume (PV) corrections. We also compared the stability of our measurements over 2 years with the stability of data from an earlier study with 2-week test-retest measurements. BP(P) was unaltered at follow-up without the use of PV correction and when applying two-tissue PV correction, test-retest reproducibility was 12-15% and reliability 0.45-0.67 in the large bilateral regions such as the parietal, temporal, occipital and frontal cortices, while orbitofrontal and anterior cingulate cortical regions were less stable. The use of PV correction decreased the variability but also decreased the between-subject variation, thereby worsening the reliability. In healthy elderly individuals, brain 5-HT(2A) receptor binding remains stable over 2 years, and acceptable reproducibility and reliability in larger regions and high intra- and interobserver stability allow the use of [(18)F]-altanserin in longitudinal studies of patients with neuropsychiatric disorders.

Many studies have found disturbances of serotonin (5-HT) activity in anorexia nervosa (AN). Because little is known about 5-HT receptor function in AN, positron emission tomography (PET) imaging with 5-HT receptor-specific radioligands was used to characterize 5-HT1A and 5-HT2A receptors. Fifteen women ill with AN (ILL AN) were compared with 29 healthy control women (CW); PET and [11C]WAY100635 were used to assess binding potential (BP) of the 5-HT1A receptor, and [18F]altanserin was used to assess postsynaptic 5-HT2A receptor BP. [15O] water and PET were used to assess cerebral blood flow. The ILL AN women had a highly significant (30%-70%) increase in [11C]WAY100635 BP in prefrontal and lateral orbital frontal regions, mesial and lateral temporal lobes, parietal cortex, and dorsal raphe nuclei compared with CW. The [18F]altanserin BP was normal in ILL AN but was positively and significantly related to harm avoidance in suprapragenual cingulate, frontal, and parietal regions. Cerebral blood flow was normal in ILL AN women. Increased activity of 5-HT1A receptor activity may help explain poor response to 5-HT medication in ILL AN. This study extends data suggesting that 5-HT function, and, specifically, the 5-HT2A receptor, is related to anxiety in AN.

This study was performed to identify and characterize the radiometabolites of the serotonin 5-HT2A receptor ligand [18F]altanserin in supporting quantification of the target receptors by positron emission tomography. In analogy to its analog ketanserin, we postulated 4-(4-fluorobenzoyl)piperidine (FBP) and altanserinol for the previously observed two polar radiometabolites, corresponding to dealkylation at the piperidine nitrogen and reduction at the ketone, respectively. To test this hypothesis and characterize the in vivo and in vitro behavior of the radiometabolites, we synthesized nonradioactive authentic compounds altanserinol, 1-(4-fluorophenyl)-1-(piperidin-4-yl)methanol (FBPOH), and isolated nonradioactive FBP metabolite from monkey plasma. [18F]Altanserinol was obtained by NaBH4 reduction of [18F]altanserin, followed by acid hydrolysis. Identification of radiometabolites was carried out by high performance liquid chromatography and thin layer chromatography comparison of the radioactive plasma after injection of tracers with five authentic compounds. Human studies revealed that at least four radiometabolites, one identified as [18F]altanserinol, resulted from reduction of the ketone functionality. The N-dealkylation product [18F]FBP was not detectable; however, a radiometabolite of FBP was present in plasma after administration of [18F]altanserin. Monkey studies showed nonradioactive FBP was converted rapidly to a less polar metabolite. In rat, altanserin and altanserinol were converted to each other in vivo, and all the radiometabolites likely penetrated the blood-brain barrier and entered the brain. Displacement binding of altanserin to cloned serotonin 5-HT2A, 5-HT2C, 5-HT6, and 5-HT7 receptors showed Ki values of 0.3, 6.0, 1,756, and 15 nM; the binding of FBP and altanserinol to these four 5-HT subtypes was negligible. We conclude from these studies that the radiometabolites of [18F]altanserin from N-dealkylation and ketone reduction should not interfere with specific receptor quantification in an equilibrium paradigm.

There is a large body of evidence that serotonin [5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT)] plays an important role in the transmission and regulation of pain. Here we used positron emission tomography (PET) to study the relationship between baseline 5-HT(2A) binding in the brain and responses to noxious heat stimulation in a group of young healthy volunteers. Twenty-one healthy subjects underwent PET scanning with the 5-HT(2A) antagonist, [(18)F]altanserin. In addition, participants underwent a battery of pain tests using noxious heat stimulation to assess pain threshold, pain tolerance and response to short-lasting phasic and long-lasting (7-minute) tonic painful stimulation. Significant positive correlations were found between tonic pain ratings and [(18)F]altanserin binding in orbitofrontal (r=0.66; p=0.005), medial inferior frontal (r=0.60; p=0.014), primary sensory-motor (r=0.61; p=0.012) and posterior cingulate (r=0.63; p=0.009) cortices. In contrast, measures of regional [(18)F]altanserin binding did not correlate with pain threshold, pain tolerance, or suprathreshold phasic pain responses. These data suggest that cortical 5-HT(2A) receptor availability co-varies with responses to tonic pain. The correlation between [(18)F]altanserin binding in prefrontal cortex and tonic pain suggests a possible role of this brain region in the modulation and/or cognitive-evaluative appreciation of pain.

Modeling short-term psychotic states with subanaesthetic doses of ketamine provides substantial experimental evidence in support of the glutamate hypothesis of schizophrenia. Ketamine exerts its pharmacological effects both directly via interactions with glutamate receptors and indirectly by stimulating presynaptic release of endogenous serotonin (5-HT). The aim of this feasibility study was to examine whether acute ketamine-induced 5-HT release interferes with the binding of the 5-HT(2A) receptor (5-HT(2A)R) radioligand [(18)F]altanserin and positron emission tomography (PET). Two subjects treated with ketamine and one subject treated with placebo underwent [(18)F]altanserin PET at distribution equilibrium conditions. Robust physiological, psychopathological and cognitive effects were present at ketamine plasma concentrations exceeding 100 microg/l during >70 min. Notwithstanding, we observed stable radioligand binding (changes +/-95% CI of -1.0 +/- 1.6% and +4.1 +/- 1.8% versus -1.2 +/- 2.6%) in large cortical regions presenting high basal uptake of both, [(18)F]altanserin and ketamine. Marginal decreases of 4% of radioligand binding were observed in the frontal lobe, and 8% in a posteriorily specified frontomesial subregion. This finding is not compatible with a specific radioligand displacement from 5-HT(2A)R which should occur proportionally throughout the whole brain. Instead, the spatial pattern of these minor reductions was congruent with ketamine-induced increases in cerebral blood flow observed in a previous study using [(15)O]butanol PET. This may caused by accelerated clearance of unspecifically bound [(18)F]altanserin from cerebral tissue with increased perfusion. In conclusion, this study suggests that [(18)F]altanserin PET is not sensitive to acute neurotransmitter fluctuations under ketamine. Advantageously, the stability of [(18)F]altanserin PET towards acute influences is a prerequisite for its future use to detect sub-acute and chronic effects of ketamine.

Numerous studies indicate that the serotonergic (5-HT) transmitter system is involved in the regulation of impulsive aggression and there is from post-mortem, in vivo imaging and genetic studies evidence that the 5-HT2A receptor may be involved. We investigated 94 healthy individuals (60 men, mean age 47.0±18.7, range 23-86) to determine if trait aggression and trait impulsivity were related to frontal cortex 5-HT2A receptor binding (5-HT2AR) as measured with [18F]-altanserin PET imaging. Trait aggression and trait impulsivity were assessed with the Buss-Perry Aggression Questionnaire (AQ) and the Barratt Impulsiveness Scale 11 (BIS-11). Statistical analyses were conducted using a multiple linear regression model and internal consistency reliability of the AQ and BIS-11 was evaluated by Cronbach's alpha. Contrary to our hypothesis, results revealed no significant associations between 5-HT2AR and the AQ or BIS-11 total scores. Also, there was no significant interaction between gender and frontal cortex 5-HT2AR in predicting trait aggression and trait impulsivity. This is the first study to examine how 5-HT2AR relates to trait aggression and trait impulsivity in a large sample of healthy individuals. Our findings are not supportive of a selective role for 5-HT2AR in mediating the 5-HT related effects on aggression and impulsivity in psychiatrically healthy individuals.

[(18)F]altanserin is the preferred radiotracer for in-vivo labeling of serotonin 2A receptors by positron emission tomography (PET). We report a modified synthesis procedure suited for reliable production of multi-GBq amounts of [(18)F]altanserin useful for application in humans. We introduced thermal heating for drying of [(18)F]fluoride as well as for the reaction instead of microwave heating. We furthermore describe solid phase extraction and HPLC procedures for quantitative determination of [(18)F]altanserin and metabolites in plasma. The time course of arterial plasma activity with and without metabolite correction was determined. 90 min after bolus injection, 38.4% of total plasma activity derived from unchanged [(18)F]altanserin. Statistical comparison of kinetic profiles of [(18)F]altanserin metabolism in plasma samples collected in the course of two ongoing studies employing placebo, the serotonin releaser dexfenfluramine and the hallucinogen psilocybin, revealed the same tracer metabolism. We conclude that metabolite analysis for correction of individual plasma input functions used in tracer modeling is not necessary for [(18)F]altanserin studies involving psilocybin or dexfenfluramine treatment.

PET brain imaging of the serotonin 2A (5-hydroxytryptamine 2A, or 5-HT(2A)) receptor has been widely used in clinical studies, and currently, several well-validated radiolabeled antagonist tracers are used for in vivo imaging of the cerebral 5-HT(2A) receptor. Access to 5-HT(2A) receptor agonist PET tracers would, however, enable imaging of the active, high-affinity state of receptors, which may provide a more meaningful assessment of membrane-bound receptors. In this study, we radiolabel the high-affinity 5-HT(2A) receptor agonist 2-(4-iodo-2,5-dimethoxyphenyl)-N-(2-[(11)C-OCH(3)]methoxybenzyl)ethanamine ((11)C-CIMBI-5) and investigate its potential as a PET tracer. The in vitro binding and activation at 5-HT(2A) receptors by CIMBI-5 was measured with binding and phosphoinositide hydrolysis assays. Ex vivo brain distribution of (11)C-CIMBI-5 was investigated in rats, and PET with (11)C-CIMBI-5 was conducted in pigs. In vitro assays showed that CIMBI-5 was a high-affinity agonist at the 5-HT(2A) receptor. After intravenous injections of (11)C-CIMBI-5, ex vivo rat studies showed a specific binding ratio of 0.77 ± 0.07 in the frontal cortex, which was reduced to cerebellar levels after ketanserin treatment, thus indicating that (11)C-CIMBI-5 binds selectively to the 5-HT(2A) receptor in the rat brain. The PET studies showed that the binding pattern of (11)C-CIMBI-5 in the pig brain was in accordance with the expected 5-HT(2A) receptor distribution. (11)C-CIMBI-5 gave rise to a cortical binding potential of 0.46 ± 0.12, and the target-to-background ratio was similar to that of the widely used 5-HT(2A) receptor antagonist PET tracer (18)F-altanserin. Ketanserin treatment reduced the cortical binding potentials to cerebellar levels, indicating that in vivo (11)C-CIMBI-5 binds selectively to the 5-HT(2A) receptor in the pig brain. (11)C-CIMBI-5 showed a cortex-to-cerebellum binding ratio equal to the widely used 5-HT(2A) antagonist PET tracer (18)F-altanserin, indicating that (11)C-CIMBI-5 has a sufficient target-to-background ratio for future clinical use and is displaceable by ketanserin in both rats and pigs. Thus, (11)C-CIMBI-5 is a promising tool for investigation of 5-HT(2A) agonist binding in the living human brain.

[18F]altanserin has been used to label serotonin 5-HT2A receptors, which are believed to be important in the pathophysiology of schizophrenia and depression. The purpose of this study was to test the feasibility of a constant infusion paradigm for equilibrium modeling of [18F]altanserin with PET. Kinetic modeling with [18F]altanserin may be hampered by the presence of lipophilic radiometabolites observed in plasma after intravenous administration. Eight healthy volunteers were injected with [18F]altanserin as a bolus (208+/-9 MBq [5.62+/-0.25 mCi]) plus constant infusion (65+/-3 MBq/h [1.76+/-0.08 mCi/h]) ranging from 555 to 626 min (615+/-24 min) after injection. PET acquisitions (10-20 min) and venous blood sampling were performed every 30-60 min throughout the infusion period. Linear regression analysis revealed that time-activity curves for both brain activity and plasma [18F]altanserin and metabolite concentrations stabilized after about 6 h. This permitted equilibrium modeling and estimation of V3' (ratio of specific uptake [cortical-cerebellar] to total plasma parent concentration after 6 h). Values of V3' ranged from 1.57+/-0.38 for anterior cingulate cortex to 1.02+/-0.39 for frontal cortex. The binding potential V3 (ratio of specific uptake to free plasma parent concentration after 6 h, using group mean f1) was also calculated and ranged from 169+/-41 for anterior cingulate cortex to 110+/-42 for frontal cortex. From 6 h onward, the rate of change for V3' and V3 was only 1.11+/-1.69 %/h. These results demonstrate the feasibility of equilibrium imaging with [18F]altanserin over more than 5 radioactive half-lives and suggest a method to overcome difficulties associated with lipophilic radiolabeled metabolites. The stability in V3 and V3' once equilibrium is achieved suggests that a single PET acquisition obtained at 6 h may provide a reasonable measure of 5-HT2A receptor density.

The vulnerability to mood disorders, impulsive-aggression, eating disorders, and suicidal behavior varies greatly with gender, and may reflect gender differences in central serotonergic function. We investigated the relationships of gender, mood, impulsivity, aggression and temperament to 5HT(2A) receptor binding in 21 healthy subjects using [18F]altanserin and PET neuroimaging. Binding potentials in pre-defined regions-of-interest (ROI) were calculated using the Logan graphical method, corrected for partial volume effects, and compared by gender with age co-varied. SPM analysis was used for voxel level comparisons. Altanserin binding (BP(P)) was greater in male than female subjects in the following nine ROIs: hippocampus (HIP) and Lt. HIP, lateral orbital frontal cortex (LOF) and Lt. LOF, left medial frontal cortex (Lt. MFC), left medial temporal cortex (Lt. MTC), left occipital cortex (Lt. OCC), thalamus (THL) and Lt. THL. Differences in Lt. HIP and Lt. MTL remained significant after Bonferroni correction. Gender differences were noted in the co-variation of psychological traits with BP(P) values in specific ROIs. Among males alone, aggression was negatively correlated with BP(P) values in Lt. LOF and Lt. MFC, and Suspiciousness positively correlated in LOF, Lt. LOF and Lt. MFC. Among female subjects alone, Negativism was positively correlated with BP(P) values in HIP, and Verbal Hostility in Lt. HIP. Altanserin binding in Lt. MTC was positively correlated with Persistence, with no significant gender effect. Gender differences in 5HT(2A) receptor function in specific ROIs may mediate expression of psychological characteristics such as aggression, suspiciousness and negativism. Future studies of 5HT(2A) receptor function and its relationship to behavior should control for gender.

The role of serotonin in CNS function and in many neuropsychiatric diseases (e.g., schizophrenia, affective disorders, degenerative dementias) support the development of a reliable measure of serotonin receptor binding in vivo in human subjects. To this end, the regional distribution and intrasubject test-retest variability of the binding of [18F]altanserin were measured as important steps in the further development of [18F]altanserin as a radiotracer for positron emission tomography (PET) studies of the serotonin 5-HT2A receptor. Two high specific activity [18F]altanserin PET studies were performed in normal control subjects (n = 8) on two separate days (2-16 days apart). Regional specific binding was assessed by distribution volume (DV), estimates that were derived using a conventional four compartment (4C) model, and the Logan graphical analysis method. For both analysis methods, levels of [18F]altanserin binding were highest in cortical areas, lower in the striatum and thalamus, and lowest in the cerebellum. Similar average differences of 13% or less were observed for the 4C model DV determined in regions with high receptor concentrations with greater variability in regions with low concentrations (16-20%). For all regions, the absolute value of the test-retest differences in the Logan DV values averaged 12% or less. The test-retest differences in the DV ratios (regional DV values normalized to the cerebellar DV) determined by both data analysis methods averaged less than 10%. The regional [18F]altanserin DV values using both of these methods were significantly correlated with literature-based values of the regional concentrations of 5-HT2A receptors determined by postmortem autoradiographic studies (r2 = 0.95, P < 0.001 for the 4C model and r2 = 0.96, P < 0.001 for the Logan method). Brain uptake studies in rats demonstrated that two different radiolabeled metabolites of [18F]altanserin (present at levels of 3-25% of the total radioactivity in human plasma 10-120 min postinjection) were able to penetrate the blood-brain barrier. However, neither of these radiolabeled metabolites bound specifically to the 5-HT2A receptor and did not interfere with the interpretation of regional [18F]altanserin-specific binding parameters obtained using either a conventional 4C model or the Logan graphical analysis method. In summary, these results demonstrate that the test-retest variability of [18F]altanserin-specific binding is comparable to that of other PET radiotracers and that the regional specific binding of [18F]altanserin in human brain was correlated with the known regional distribution of 5-HT2A receptors. These findings support the usefulness of [18F]altanserin as a radioligand for PET studies of 5-HT2A receptors.

The study presented here firstly compares the distribution of the binding potential of the serotonin-5HT2A receptor as measured in vivo with data of receptor density taken from literature. Secondly, the sensitivity of the method to detect gradual differences in receptor densities is evaluated. Positron emission tomography (PET) studies were carried out in 6 healthy volunteers using the selective serotonin-5HT2A ligand 18F-altanserin. The binding potential was quantified in 12 regions using Logan's graphical method and the equilibrium method. These data were compared to the distribution of receptor density as taken from literature. The binding data in vivo correlated to autoradiography data (post mortem) with r = 0.83 (Pearson regression coefficient; p < 0.0001). A difference in the receptor density between two regions could be detected with p < 0.05 when it amounted at least to 18%. This study demonstrates a good agreement between in vivo data obtained with 18F-altanserin and PET in healthy volunteers and the true autoradiographically determined distribution of 5HT2A receptors in human brains. The in vivo method seems to be sensitive enough to detect changes in receptor density of more than 18%.

The aim of the present study was to develop an experimental paradigm for the study of serotonergic neurotransmission in humans using positron emission tomography and the 5-HT2A selective radioligand [18F]altanserin. [18F]altanserin studies were conducted in seven subjects using the bolus/infusion approach designed for attaining steady state in blood and brain 2 hours after the initial [18F]altanserin administration. Three hours after commencement of radiotracer administration, 0.25 mg/kg of the selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor, citalopram (Lundbeck, Valby, Denmark), was administered to all subjects as a constant infusion for 20 minutes. To reduce 5-HT1A-mediated autoinhibition of cortical 5-HT release, four of the seven subjects were pretreated with the partial 5-HT1A agonist pindolol for 3 days at an increasing oral dose (25 mg on the day of scanning). In each subject, the baseline condition (120 to 180 minutes) was compared with the stimulated condition (195 to 300 minutes). Despite a pronounced increase in plasma prolactin and two subjects reporting hot flushes compatible with an 5-HT-induced adverse effect, cortical [18F]altanserin binding was insensitive to the citalopram challenge, even after pindolol pretreatment. The biochemical and cellular events possibly affecting the unsuccessful translation of the citalopram/pindolol challenge into a change in 5-HT2A receptor binding of [18F]altanserin are discussed.

Changes in serotonin-2 receptors have been demonstrated in brain autopsy material from patients with various neurodegenerative and affective disorders. It would be desirable to locate a ligand for the study of these receptors in vivo with positron emission tomography (PET). Altanserin is a 4-benzoylpiperidine derivative with a high affinity and selectivity for S2 receptors in vitro. Dynamic PET studies were carried out in nine normal volunteers with high-specific activity (376-1,680 mCi/mumol) [18F]altanserin. Arterial blood samples were obtained and the plasma time-activity curves were corrected for the presence of labeled metabolites. Thirty minutes after injection, selective retention of the radioligand was observed in cortical areas, while the cerebellum, caudate, and thalamus had low radioactivity levels. Specific binding reached a plateau between 30 and 65 min postinjection at 1.8% of the injected dose/L of brain and then decreased, indicating the reversibility of the binding. The total/nonspecific binding ratio reached 2.6 for times between 50 and 70 min postinjection. The graphical analysis proposed by Logan et al. allowed us to estimate the binding potential (Bmax/KD). Pretreatment with ketanserin was given to three volunteers and brain activity remained uniformly low. An additional study in one volunteer showed that [18F]altanserin can be displaced from the receptors by large doses of ketanserin. At the end of the study, unchanged altanserin was 57% of the total plasma activity. These results suggest that [18F]altanserin is selective for S2 receptors in vivo as it is in vitro. They indicate that [18F]altanserin is suitable for imaging and quantifying S2 receptors with PET in humans.

While the selective 5-hydroxytryptamine type 2a receptor (5-HT2AR) radiotracer [18F]altanserin is well established in humans, the present study evaluated its suitability for quantifying cerebral 5-HT2ARs with positron emission tomography (PET) in albino rats. Ten Sprague Dawley rats underwent 180 min PET scans with arterial blood sampling. Reference tissue methods were evaluated on the basis of invasive kinetic models with metabolite-corrected arterial input functions. In vivo 5-HT2AR quantification with PET was validated by in vitro autoradiographic saturation experiments in the same animals. Overall brain uptake of [18F]altanserin was reliably quantified by invasive and non-invasive models with the cerebellum as reference region shown by linear correlation of outcome parameters. Unlike in humans, no lipophilic metabolites occurred so that brain activity derived solely from parent compound. PET data correlated very well with in vitro autoradiographic data of the same animals. [18F]Altanserin PET is a reliable tool for in vivo quantification of 5-HT2AR availability in albino rats. Models based on both blood input and reference tissue describe radiotracer kinetics adequately. Low cerebral tracer uptake might, however, cause restrictions in experimental usage.

It has been suggested that impulsive behavior is caused by dysfunctional serotonergic 5-HT neurotransmission in the central nervous system (CNS). Brain neuroimaging studies have shown that behavioral inhibition is linked to the activation of cortex sites such as the ventral frontal cortex. Positron emission tomography (PET) imaging with [(18)F]altanserin to characterize 5-HT(2A) receptor binding revealed a reduction in 5-HT(2A) binding in the ventral frontal cortex in women who had recovered from impulsive diseases. These clinical, neuroimaging, and pharmacological studies appear to support the hypothesis that functional alteration of neurotransmission due to genetic polymorphisms of the 5-HT receptors may be involved in impulsive behavior modulation. Following evaluation by a self-reporting measure, it was proposed that a polymorphism in the promoter of the 5-HT(2A) receptor gene is the underlying cause of impulsive behavior; however, this hypothesis is not convincing. We examined whether the polymorphism in the 5-HT(2A) receptor gene promoter is involved in impulsive aggression by evaluating a behavioral task (Go/No-go task) in normal volunteers. The polymorphism of the 5-HT(2A) receptor gene promoter in lymphocytes from 71 volunteers was analyzed by using PCR. Impulsivity was defined as the number of commission errors (responding when one should not) recorded during a Go/No-go task; a larger number of commission errors indicate greater difficulty in inhibiting impulsive behavior. The subjects of the A-1438A allele group for the 5-HT(2A) receptor gene made more commission errors under the punishment-reward (PR)condition in a Go/No-go task than those in the G-1438G group. In the present review, we discuss and suggest the possible involvement of the A-1438A polymorphism of the 5HT2A receptor gene promoter in impulsive behavior. This hypothesis was evaluated by using a behavioral task measure that could directly reveal impulsive behavioral traits in humans.

Neurobiological evidence implicates the amygdala as well as serotonergic (serotonin, 5-HT) signaling via postsynaptic 5-HT(2A) receptors as essential substrates of anxiety behaviors. Assuming a functional interdependence of these substrates, we hypothesized that a low-fear behavioral phenotype due to bilateral lesion of the amygdala would be associated with significant 5-HT(2A) receptor changes. Thus, we used [(18)F]altanserin positron emission tomography (PET) referenced to radioligand plasma levels and corrected for partial volume effects to quantify the spatial distribution of 5-HT(2A) receptor binding potential (BP(P)) in a rare patient with Urbach-Wiethe disease and selective bilateral amygdala calcification damage relative to 10 healthy control subjects. Consistent with our a priori hypothesis, we observed a 70% global decrease in 5-HT(2A) receptor BP(P) in the Urbach-Wiethe patient relative to controls. Thus, brain abnormalities in this patient are not restricted to the amygdala, but extend to overall 5-HT neurotransmission via 5-HT(2A) receptors. Our findings provide important insights into the molecular architecture of human anxiety behaviors and suggest the 5-HT(2A) receptor as a promising pharmacological target to control pathological anxiety.

A dysfunction of multiple neurotransmitter systems is assumed as a neurochemical basis of the akinetic-rigid syndrome of progressive supranuclear palsy (PSP). In vitro studies have produced conflicting results on the serotoninergic system in PSP. We, therefore, studied the binding potential of the serotonin 2A (5-HT(2A)) receptor ligand [18F]altanserin in 8 patients with clinically probable PSP and 13 healthy controls using positron emission tomography. We found an up-regulation of 5-HT(2A) receptors in the substantia nigra and, to a lower degree, in the striatum, while neocortical 5- HT(2A) receptor densities showed no changes upon partial-volume correction. Nigral and striatal receptor changes were significantly correlated with patients' scores of motor dysfunction (UPDRS III, PSP-rating scale) pointing to a functional relevance of the described findings.

To determine whether there are abnormalities in the in vivo status of the serotonin type 2A (5-HT2A) receptor in late-life depression and Alzheimer's disease, the authors used positron emission tomography (PET) to assess patients with these two conditions and healthy subjects. PET was performed by using [18F]altanserin to evaluate 5-HT2A receptor binding in 11 elderly patients with depression (four men, seven women; mean age = 65.0 years, SD = 5.5); nine Alzheimer's disease patients, including three with concurrent depression (two men, seven women; mean age = 69.7 years, SD = 5.0); and 10 age-matched healthy subjects (four men, six women; mean age = 69.8 years, SD = 5.0). Partial-volume correction of regional specific binding estimates was performed by using a method based on magnetic resonance imaging. No significant abnormalities in [18F]altanserin binding (binding potential) were observed in the patients with late-life depression, and no effect of depression on binding potential was present within the Alzheimer's disease group. However, the patients with Alzheimer's disease had significantly lower binding than the normal subjects in several brain regions, including the anterior cingulate, prefrontal cortex, and sensorimotor cortex. These results suggest that the 5-HT2A receptor is differentially affected in late-life depression and Alzheimer's disease, a finding that has implications for the etiological basis of mood and cognitive features of neuropsychiatric disorders of late life.

Imaging the cerebral serotonin 2A (5-HT2A ) receptors with positron emission tomography (PET) has been carried out in humans with [(11) C]MDL 100907 and [(18) F]altanserin. Recently, the MDL 100907 analogue [(18) F]MH.MZ was developed combining the selectivity profile of MDL 100907 and the favourable radiophysical properties of fluorine-18. Here, we present a direct comparison of [(18) F]altanserin and [(18) F]MH.MZ. 5-HT2A receptor binding in pig cortex and cerebellum was investigated by autoradiography with [(3) H]MDL 100907, [(18) F]MH.MZ, and [(18) F]altanserin. [(18) F]MH.MZ and [(18) F]altanserin were investigated in Danish Landrace pigs by brain PET scanning at baseline and after i.v. administration of blocking doses of ketanserin. Full arterial input function and high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) analysis allowed for tissue-compartment kinetic modeling of PET data. In vitro autoradiography showed high binding in cortical regions with both [(18) F]MH.MZ and [(18) F]altanserin. Significant 5-HT2A receptor binding was also found in the pig cerebellum, thus making this region unsuitable as a reference region for in vivo data analysis in this species. The cortical binding of [(18) F]MH.MZ and [(18) F]altanserin was blocked by ketanserin supporting that both radioligands bind to 5-HT2A receptors in the pig brain. In the HPLC analysis of pig plasma, [(18) F]MH.MZ displayed a fast and reproducible metabolism resulting in hydrophilic radiometabolites only whereas the metabolic profile of [(18) F]altanserin as expected showed lipophilic radiometabolites. Due to the slow kinetics of [(18) F]MH.MZ in high-binding regions in vivo, we suggest that [(18) F]MH.MZ will be an appropriate tracer for low binding regions where kinetics will be faster, whereas [(18) F]altanserin is a suitable tracer for high-binding regions.

Poor behavioral inhibition is a common feature of neurological and psychiatric disorders. Successful inhibition of a prepotent response in 'NoGo' paradigms requires the integrity of both the inferior frontal gyrus (IFG) and the serotonergic system. We investigated individual differences in serotonergic regulation of response inhibition. In 24 healthy adults, we used (18)F-altanserin positron emission tomography to assess cerebral 5-HT2A receptors, which have been related to impulsivity. We then investigated the impact of two acute manipulations of brain serotonin levels on behavioral and neural correlates of inhibition using intravenous citalopram and acute tryptophan depletion during functional magnetic resonance imaging. We adapted the NoGo paradigm to isolate effects on inhibition per se as opposed to other aspects of the NoGo paradigm. Successful NoGo inhibition was associated with greater activation of the right IFG compared to control trials with alternative responses, indicating that the IFG is activated with inhibition in NoGo trials rather than other aspects of invoked cognitive control. Activation of the left IFG during NoGo trials was greater with citalopram than acute tryptophan depletion. Moreover, with the NoGo-type of response inhibition, the right IFG displayed an interaction between the type of serotonergic challenge and neocortical 5-HT2A receptor binding. Specifically, acute tryptophan depletion (ATD) produced a relatively larger NoGo response in the right IFG in subjects with low 5-HT2A BPP but reduced the NoGo response in those with high 5-HT2A BPP. These links between serotonergic function and response inhibition in healthy subjects may help to interpret serotonergic abnormalities underlying impulsivity in neuropsychiatric disorders.

The 5-hydroxytryptamine type 2a (5-HT(2A)) selective radiotracer [(18)F]altanserin has been subjected to a quantitative micro-positron emission tomography study in Lister Hooded rats. Metabolite-corrected plasma input modeling was compared with reference tissue modeling using the cerebellum as reference tissue. [(18)F]altanserin showed sufficient brain uptake in a distribution pattern consistent with the known distribution of 5-HT(2A) receptors. Full binding saturation and displacement was documented, and no significant uptake of radioactive metabolites was detected in the brain. Blood input as well as reference tissue models were equally appropriate to describe the radiotracer kinetics. [(18)F]altanserin is suitable for quantification of 5-HT(2A) receptor availability in rats.

To further validate its use in positron emission tomography (PET), we studied the binding of [18F]altanserin, a specific 5HT2 radioligand, in the rat brain using in vivo autoradiography. Distribution of [18F]altanserin binding was comparable to the in vitro mapping of 5HT2 receptors reported in the literature. Selective displacers were used to test the reversibility and the selectivity of this radioligand. Specific binding of [18F]altanserin in the rat frontal cortex was quantified by direct counting with an electronic imaging system and by quantification on digitalized autoradiograms. Close results of about 30 pmol/g were obtained with both methods. Our data confirmed that [18F]altanserin is a valid tracer for 5HT2 receptors binding studies.

The status of the radiochemical development and biological evaluation of radioligands and tracers for PET studies of the serotonergic system is reviewed, indicating those agents with present value and those with future potential. Practical recommendations are given for the preparation of two useful radioligands for PET studies of central 5-HT2 receptors, namely [18F]setoperone and [18F]altanserin. Though, it has not proved possible to recommend tracers or radioligands for the study of other aspects of serotonergic system, prospects for future radiochemical development are indicated, especially for developing radioligands for the 5-HT re-uptake site, and for the 5-HT1 and 5-HT3 receptors.

The serotonin (5-HT) neurotransmitter system, which has a widespread distribution in the central nervous system, has been implicated in regulating mood and many human behaviors. There is evidence from postmortem human studies and limited information from prior in vivo studies to support a decline in 5-HT2A receptor density with aging. We examined nine elderly (ages 61-76) and nine young (ages 18-29) healthy individuals with positron emission tomography (PET) and [18F]altanserin, a ligand with high affinity for the 5-HT2A binding site. The PET data were corrected for differences in brain tissue volume between the young and elderly subjects using a magnetic resonance (MR) imaging-based partial volume correction method. Highly significant and widespread cortical reductions in 5-HT2A specific binding were demonstrated in the elderly group relative to young controls. Regional losses averaged 61% before and 57% following correction for effects of cerebral atrophy. This finding, which is consistent with prior postmortem and in vivo studies, has both etiological and potential therapeutic implications for behavioral changes commonly observed in the elderly, including geriatric depression.
