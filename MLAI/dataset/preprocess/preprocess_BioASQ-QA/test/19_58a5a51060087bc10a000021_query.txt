Which NADPH oxidase family member requires interaction with NOXO1 for function?

[PMID: 18929641]
NADPH oxidase 1 (Nox1) is a multicomponent enzyme consisting of p22(phox), Nox organizer 1 (NOXO1), Nox1 activator 1, and Rac1. Interleukin-1beta, flagellin, interferon-gamma, and tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-alpha) similarly induced Nox1 in a colon cancer cell line (T84), whereas only TNF-alpha fully induced NOXO1 and upregulated superoxide-producing activity by ninefold. This upregulation was canceled by knockdown of NOXO1 with small interfering RNAs. TNF-alpha rapidly phosphorylated p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase and c-Jun N-terminal kinase 1/2, followed by phosphorylation of c-Jun and c-Fos and appearance of an AP-1 binding activity within 30 min. We cloned the 5' flank of the human NOXO1 gene (-3888 to +263 bp), and found that the region between -585 and -452 bp, which contains consensus elements of YY-1, AP-1, and Ets, and the GC-rich region encoding three putative binding sites for SP-1, was crucial for TNF-alpha-dependent promoter activity. Serial mutation analysis of the elements identified an AP-1 binding site (from -561 to -551 bp, agtAAGtcatg) as a crucial element for TNF-alpha-stimulated transcription of the human NOXO1 gene, which was also confirmed by the AP-1 decoy experiments. Thus, TNF-alpha acts as a potent activator of Nox1-based oxidase in colon epithelial cells, suggesting a potential role of this oxidase in inflammation of the colon.

The members of the NOX family of enzymes are expressed in a variety of tissues and serve a number of functions. There is a high level of conservation of primary protein sequence, as well as functional features, although specialized responses are beginning to emerge. In this context, our data demonstrate that the NOX1 cytoplasmic domains interact efficiently with the cytoplasmic subunits of the phagocyte NADPH oxidase and identify the second cytoplasmic loop of NOX electron transporters as a crucial domain for enzyme function. Studies of cytosolic co-factors showed that the C-terminal cytoplasmic domain of NOX1 was absolutely required for activation with NOXO1 and NOXA1 and that this activity required interaction of the putative NADPH-binding region of this domain with NOXA1. Finally, we have provided the first example of how alternative splicing of a NOX co-factor may be involved in the regulation of NADPH oxidase function.

The phagocyte NADPH oxidase is dormant in resting cells but becomes activated during phagocytosis to produce superoxide, a precursor of microbicidal oxidants, thereby playing a crucial role in host defence. The catalytic core of this enzyme comprises the two membranous subunits gp91phox/Nox2 and p22phox. The oxidase activation requires the small GTPase Rac and the SH3 domain-containing proteins p47phox and p67phox; they normally exist in the cytoplasm and translocate upon cell stimulation to the membrane. The translocation depends on a stimulus-induced conformational change of p47phox, which leads to the SH3 domain-mediated interaction with p22phox, a binding required for the gp91phox/Nox2-dependent superoxide production. Activation of Nox1, an oxidase that is likely involved in host defence at the colon, requires novel proteins homologous to p47phox and p67phox, designated Noxo1 and Noxa1, respectively. Noxo1 and Noxa1, both expressed abundantly in the colon, are capable of constitutively activating Nox1. The constitutive activation may be due to the property of Noxo1: in contrast with p47phox, Noxo1 seems to normally associate with p22phox, which is required for the Nox1 activation. We will also describe the mechanism underlying regulation of the third oxidase Nox3, which exits in fetal kidney and inner ears.

Nox3, a member of the superoxide-producing NADPH oxidase (Nox) family, participates in otoconia formation in mouse inner ears, which is required for perception of balance and gravity. The activity of other Nox enzymes such as gp91(phox)/Nox2 and Nox1 is known to absolutely require both an organizer protein (p47(phox) or Noxo1) andanactivatorprotein (p67(phox) or Noxa1); for the p47(phox)-dependent activation of these oxidases, treatment of cells with stimulants such as phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate is also indispensable. Here we show that ectopic expression of Nox3 in various types of cells leads to phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate-independent constitutive production of a substantial amount of superoxide under the conditions where gp91(phox) and Nox1 fail to generate superoxide, i.e. in the absence of the oxidase organizers and activators. Nox3 likely forms a functional complex with p22(phox); Nox3 physically interacts with and stabilizes p22(phox), and the Nox3-dependent superoxide production is totally dependent on p22(phox). The organizers p47(phox) and Noxo1 are capable of enhancing the superoxide production by Nox3 in the absence of the activators, and the enhancement requires the interaction of the organizers with p22(phox), further indicating a link between Nox3 and p22(phox). The p47(phox)-enhanced Nox3 activity is further facilitated by p67(phox) or Noxa1, whereas the activators cancel the Noxo1-induced enhancement. On the other hand, the small GTPase Rac, essential for the gp91(phox) activity, is likely dispensable to the Nox3 system. Thus Nox3 functions together with p22(phox) as an enzyme constitutively producing superoxide, which can be distinctly regulated by combinatorial use of the organizers and activators.

Despite numerous reports implicating NADPH oxidases (Nox) in the pathogenesis of many diseases, precise regulation of this family of professional reactive oxygen species (ROS) producers remains unclear. A unique member of this family, Nox1 oxidase, functions as either a canonical or hybrid system using Nox organizing subunit 1 (NoxO1) or p47(phox), respectively, the latter of which is functional in vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMC). In this manuscript, we identify critical requirement of ezrin-radixin-moesin-binding phosphoprotein 50 (EBP50; aka NHERF1) for Nox1 activation and downstream responses. Superoxide (O2 (•-)) production induced by angiotensin II (AngII) was absent in mouse EBP50 KO VSMC vs. WT. Moreover, ex vivo incubation of aortas with AngII showed a significant increase in O2 (•-) in WT but not EBP50 or Nox1 nulls. Similarly, lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced oxidative stress was attenuated in femoral arteries from EBP50 KO vs. WT. In silico analyses confirmed by confocal microscopy, immunoprecipitation, proximity ligation assay, FRET, and gain-/loss-of-function mutagenesis revealed binding of EBP50, via its PDZ domains, to a specific motif in p47(phox) Functional studies revealed AngII-induced hypertrophy was absent in EBP50 KOs, and in VSMC overexpressing EBP50, Nox1 gene silencing abolished VSMC hypertrophy. Finally, ex vivo measurement of lumen diameter in mouse resistance arteries exhibited attenuated AngII-induced vasoconstriction in EBP50 KO vs. WT. Taken together, our data identify EBP50 as a previously unidentified regulator of Nox1 and support that it promotes Nox1 activity by binding p47(phox) This interaction is pivotal for agonist-induced smooth muscle ROS, hypertrophy, and vasoconstriction and has implications for ROS-mediated physiological and pathophysiological processes.

Superoxide production by Nox1, a member of the Nox family NAPDH oxidases, requires expression of its regulatory soluble proteins Noxo1 (Nox organizer 1) and Noxa1 (Nox activator 1) and is markedly enhanced upon cell stimulation with phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA), a potent activator of protein kinase C (PKC). The mechanism underlying PMA-induced enhancement of Nox1 activity, however, remains to be elucidated. Here we show that, in response to PMA, Noxo1 undergoes phosphorylation at multiple sites, which is inhibited by the PKC inhibitor GF109203X. Among them, Thr341 in Noxo1 is directly phosphorylated by PKC in vitro, and alanine substitution for this residue reduces not only PMA-induced Noxo1 phosphorylation but also PMA-dependent enhancement of Nox1-catalyzed superoxide production. Phosphorylation of Thr341 allows Noxo1 to sufficiently interact with Noxa1, an interaction that participates in Nox1 activation. Thus phosphorylation of Noxo1 at Thr341 appears to play a crucial role in PMA-elicited activation of Nox1, providing a molecular link between PKC-mediated signal transduction and Nox1-catalyzed superoxide production. Furthermore, Ser154 in Noxo1 is phosphorylated in both resting and PMA-stimulated cells, and the phosphorylation probably participates in a PMA-independent constitutive activity of Nox1. Ser154 may also be involved in protein kinase A (PKA) mediated regulation of Nox1; this serine is the major residue that is phosphorylated by PKA in vitro. Thus phosphorylation of Noxo1 at Thr341 and at Ser154 appears to regulate Nox1 activity in different manners. Noxo1 binds to p22phox by pull down (1, 2, 3) Noxo1 binds to Noxo1 by pull down (View interaction) Noxa1 binds to Noxo1 by pull down (1, 2, 3, 4, 5).

We have previously shown that NADPH oxidase (NOX) lies upstream of uncoupled endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS), which is known to occur in diabetic endothelium. However, it remains unclear which specific NOX isoform(s) is responsible for eNOS uncoupling and endothelial dysfunction in diabetic mouse models. The aim of the present study was to test the hypothesis that one or more NOX isoform(s) mediate(s) diabetic uncoupling of eNOS, which has been shown to occur in patients with diabetes to contribute to endothelial dysfunction. Diabetes was induced by streptozotocin administration. The N (ω)-nitro-L-arginine methyl ester (L-NAME)-sensitive superoxide production of aortic segments, reflective of eNOS uncoupling activity, was determined by electron spin resonance. The L-NAME-sensitive superoxide production was more than doubled in wild-type diabetic mice, implicating uncoupling of eNOS. This was abolished in diabetic p47 ( phox-/-) (also known as Ncf1 (-/-)) mice, but preserved in Nox2 (-/y) (also known as Cybb (-/-)) mice made diabetic. The eNOS uncoupling activity was markedly attenuated in diabetic mice transfected with Nox1 or Nox1 organiser 1 (Noxo1) short interfering RNA (siRNA), and abolished in Nox1 (-/y) diabetic mice. Diabetes-induced impairment in endothelium-dependent vasorelaxation was also significantly attenuated in the Nox1 (-/y) mice made diabetic. By contrast, Nox4 siRNA, or inhibition of mitochondrial complex I or III with rotenone or siRNA, respectively, had no effect on diabetic uncoupling of eNOS. Overexpression of Dhfr, or oral administration of folic acid to improve dihydrofolate reductase (DHFR) function, recoupled eNOS in diabetes to improve endothelial function. Our data demonstrate for the first time that the p47(phox) and NOXO1-dependent activation of NOX1, but not that of NOX2, NOX4 or mitochondrion, mediates diabetic uncoupling of eNOS. NOX1-null mice are protected from diabetic endothelial dysfunction. Novel approaches to inhibit NOX1 and/or improve DHFR function, may prove to have therapeutic potential for diabetic endothelial dysfunction.

The reactive oxygen-generating NADPH oxidases (Noxes) function in a variety of biological roles, and can be broadly classified into those that are regulated by subunit interactions and those that are regulated by calcium. The prototypical subunit-regulated Nox, Nox2, is the membrane-associated catalytic subunit of the phagocyte NADPH-oxidase. Nox2 forms a heterodimer with the integral membrane protein, p22phox, and this heterodimer binds to the regulatory subunits p47phox, p67phox, p40phox and the small GTPase Rac, triggering superoxide generation. Nox-organizer protein 1 (NOXO1) and Nox-activator 1 (NOXA1), respective homologs of p47phox and p67phox, together with p22phox and Rac, activate Nox1, a non-phagocytic homolog of Nox2. NOXO1 and p22phox also regulate Nox3, whereas Nox4 requires only p22phox. In this study, we have assembled and analyzed amino acid sequences of Nox regulatory subunit orthologs from vertebrates, a urochordate, an echinoderm, a mollusc, a cnidarian, a choanoflagellate, fungi and a slime mold amoeba to investigate the evolutionary history of these subunits. Ancestral p47phox, p67phox, and p22phox genes are broadly seen in the metazoa, except for the ecdysozoans. The choanoflagellate Monosiga brevicollis, the unicellular organism that is the closest relatives of multicellular animals, encodes early prototypes of p22phox, p47phox as well as the earliest known Nox2-like ancestor of the Nox1-3 subfamily. p67phox- and p47phox-like genes are seen in the sea urchin Strongylocentrotus purpuratus and the limpet Lottia gigantea that also possess Nox2-like co-orthologs of vertebrate Nox1-3. Duplication of primordial p47phox and p67phox genes occurred in vertebrates, with the duplicated branches evolving into NOXO1 and NOXA1. Analysis of characteristic domains of regulatory subunits suggests a novel view of the evolution of Nox: in fish, p40phox participated in regulating both Nox1 and Nox2, but after the appearance of mammals, Nox1 (but not Nox2) became independent of p40phox. In the fish Oryzias latipes, a NOXO1 ortholog retains an autoinhibitory region that is characteristic of mammalian p47phox, and this was subsequently lost from NOXO1 in later vertebrates. Detailed amino acid sequence comparisons identified both putative key residues conserved in characteristic domains and previously unidentified conserved regions. Also, candidate organizer/activator proteins in fungi and amoeba are identified and hypothetical activation models are suggested. This is the first report to provide the comprehensive view of the molecular evolution of regulatory subunits for Nox enzymes. This approach provides clues for understanding the evolution of biochemical and physiological functions for regulatory-subunit-dependent Nox enzymes.

It is well established that growth-factor-induced reactive oxygen species (ROS) act as second messengers in cell signaling. We have previously reported that betaPix, a guanine nucleotide exchange factor for Rac, interacts with NADPH oxidase 1 (Nox1) leading to EGF-induced ROS generation. Here, we report the identification of the domains of Nox1 and betaPix responsible for the interaction between the two proteins. GST pull-down assays show that the PH domain of betaPix binds to the FAD-binding region of Nox1. We also show that overexpression of the PH domain of betaPix results in inhibition of superoxide anion generation in response to EGF. Additionally, NADPH oxidase Organizer 1 (NoxO1) is shown to interact with the NADPH-binding region of Nox1. These results suggest that the formation of the complex consisting of Nox1, betaPix, and NoxO1 is likely to be a critical step in EGF-induced ROS generation.

The superoxide-producing phagocyte NADPH oxidase gp91(phox)/Nox2 and the non-phagocytic oxidases Nox1 and Nox3 each form a complex in the membrane with p22(phox), which provides both stabilization and a docking site for organizer proteins. The p22(phox)-complexed Nox2 and Nox1 are dormant on their own, and their activation requires soluble supportive proteins such as a Nox organizer (p47(phox) or Noxo1) and a Nox activator (p67(phox) or Noxa1). The small GTPase Rac directly binds to the activators, and thus plays an essential role in the Nox2-based oxidase containing p47(phox) and p67(phox) or a positive role in Nox1 activity supported by Noxo1 and Noxa1. Although Nox3 complexed with p22(phox) constitutively produce superoxide, the production can be enhanced by supportive proteins. Here we compare the roles of Rac in these p22(phox)-dependent oxidases using the organizer and activator in different combinations. Expression of constitutively active Rac1(Q61L) is essential for activation of the Nox2- or Nox1-based oxidase containing the organizer p47(phox) and either p67(phox) or Noxa1. When these oxidases use Noxo1 as an organizer instead of p47(phox), they produce a small but significant amount of superoxide without expression of Rac1(Q61L), although the production is enhanced by Rac1(Q61L). Thus p47(phox) is likely related to strict dependence on Rac. The Nox3-based oxidase has a similar tendency in the change of the dependence: Rac plays a positive role in Nox3 activation in the presence of p47(phox) and either p67(phox) or Noxa1, whereas Rac fails to upregulate Nox3 activity when p47(phox) is replaced with Noxo1. We also demonstrate that, in the Nox3-based oxidase containing solely p67(phox) as supportive protein, expression of Rac1(Q61L) enhances not only superoxide production but also membrane translocation of p67(phox). Since the enhancements are not observed with a mutant p67(phox) defective in binding to Rac, this GTPase appear to directly recruit p67(phox) to the membrane.

Several Nox family NADPH oxidases function as multicomponent enzyme systems. We explored determinants of assembly of the multicomponent oxidases Nox1 and Nox3 and examined the involvement of Rac1 in their regulation. Both enzymes are supported by p47phox and p67phox or homologous regulators called Noxo1 and Noxa1, although Nox3 is less dependent on these cofactors for activity. Plasma membrane targeting of Noxa1 depends on Noxo1, through tail-to-tail interactions between these proteins. Noxa1 can support Nox1 without Noxo1, when targeted to the plasma membrane by fusing membrane-binding sequences from Rac1 (amino acids 183 to 192) to the C terminus of Noxa1. However, membrane targeting of Noxa1 is not sufficient for activation of Nox1. Both the Noxo1-independent and -dependent Nox1 systems involve Rac1, since they are affected by Rac1 mutants or Noxa1 mutants defective in Rac binding or short interfering RNA-mediated Rac1 silencing. Nox1 or Nox3 expression promotes p22phox transport to the plasma membrane, and both oxidases are inhibited by mutations in the p22phox binding sites (SH3 domains) of the Nox organizers (p47phox or Noxo1). Regulation of Nox3 by Rac1 was also evident from the effects of mutant Rac1 or mutant Nox3 activators (p67phox or Noxa1) or Rac1 silencing. In the absence of Nox organizers, the Nox activators (p67phox or Noxa1) colocalize with Rac1 within ruffling membranes, independently of their ability to bind Rac1. Thus, Rac1 regulates both oxidases through the Nox activators, although it does not appear to direct the subcellular localization of these activators.

Reactive oxygen species (ROS) have been known for a long time to play important roles in host defense against microbial infections. In addition, it has become apparent that they also perform regulatory roles in signal transduction and cell proliferation. The source of these chemicals are members of the NOX family of NADPH oxidases that are found in a variety of tissues. NOX1, an NADPH oxidase homologue that is most abundantly expressed in colon epithelial cells, requires the regulatory subunits NOXO1 (NOX organizing protein 1) and NOXA1 (NOX activating protein 1), as well as the flavocytochrome component p22(phox) for maximal activity. Unlike NOX2, the phagocytic NADPH oxidase whose activity is tightly repressed in the resting state, NOX1 produces superoxide constitutively at low levels. These levels can be further increased in a stimulus-dependent manner, yet the molecular details regulating this activity are not fully understood. Here we present the first quantitative characterization of the interactions made between the cytosolic regulators NOXO1 and NOXA1 and membrane-bound p22(phox). Using isothermal titration calorimetry we show that the isolated tandem SH3 domains of NOXO1 bind to p22(phox) with high affinity, most likely adopting a superSH3 domain conformation. In contrast, complex formation is severely inhibited in the presence of the C-terminal tail of NOXO1, suggesting that this region competes for binding to p22(phox) and thereby contributes to the regulation of superoxide production. Furthermore, we provide data indicating that the molecular details of the interaction between NOXO1 and NOXA1 is significantly different from that between the homologous proteins of the phagocytic oxidase, suggesting that there are important functional differences between the two systems. Taken together, this study provides clear evidence that the assembly of the NOX1 oxidase complex can be regulated through reversible protein-protein interactions.

NADPH oxidase (Nox) family enzymes are one of the main sources of cellular reactive oxygen species (ROS), which have been implicated in several physiological and pathophysiological processes. To date seven members of this family have been reported, including Nox1-5 and Duox1 and 2. With the exception of Nox2, the regulation of the Nox enzymes is still poorly understood. Nox1 is highly expressed in the colon, and requires two cytosolic regulators, the organizer subunit NoxO1 and the activator subunit NoxA1, as well as the binding of Rac1 GTPase, for its activity. Recently, we identified the c-Src substrate proteins Tks4 and Tks5 as functional members of a p47(phox)-related organizer superfamily. As a functional consequence of this interaction, Nox1 localizes to invadopodia, actin-rich membrane protrusions of cancer cells which facilitate pericellular proteolysis and invasive behavior. Here, we report that Tks4 and Tks5 directly bind to NoxA1. Moreover, the integrity of the N-terminal PRR of NoxA1 is essential for this direct interaction with the Tks proteins. When the PRR in NoxA1 is disrupted, Tks proteins cannot bind NoxA1 and lose their ability to support Nox1-dependent ROS generation. Consistent with this, Tks4 and Tks5 are unable to act as organizers for Nox2 because of their inability to interact with p67(phox), which lacks the N-terminal PRR, thus conferring a unique specificity to Tks4 and 5. Taken together, these results clarify the molecular basis for the interaction between NoxA1 and the Tks proteins and may provide new insights into the pharmacological design of a more effective anti-metastatic strategy.

Reactive oxygen species (ROS) production by NADPH oxidase 1 (NOX1), which is mainly expressed in colon epithelial cells, requires the membrane-bound component p22(PHOX) and the cytosolic partners NOX organizer 1 (NOXO1), NOX activator 1 (NOXA1), and Rac1. Contrary to that of its phagocyte counterpart NOX2, the molecular basis of NOX1 regulation is not clear. Because NOXO1 lacks the phosphorylated region found in its homolog p47(PHOX), the current view is that NOX1 activation occurs without NOXO1 phosphorylation. Here, however, we demonstrate that phorbol myristate acetate (PMA) stimulates NOXO1 phosphorylation in a transfected human embryonic kidney (HEK) 293 epithelial cell model via protein kinase C and identify Ser-154 as the major phosphorylated site. Endogenous NOXO1 from T84 colon epithelial cells was also phosphorylated, suggesting that NOXO1 phosphorylation is physiologically relevant. In transfected HEK-293 cells, PMA-induced phosphorylation on Ser-154 enhanced NOXO1 binding to NOXA1 (+97%) and to the p22(PHOX) C-terminal region (+384%), increased NOXO1 colocalization with p22(PHOX), and allowed optimal ROS production by NOX1 as demonstrated by the use of S154A and S154D mutants compared with that by wild-type NOXO1 (P<0.05). Pulldown experiments revealed that phos-phorylation on Ser-154 was sufficient to markedly enhance NOXO1 binding to NOXA1, which in turn acts as a molecular switch, allowing optimal interaction of NOXO1 with p22(PHOX). This study unexpectedly revealed that full assembly and activation of NOX1 is a tightly regulated process in which NOXO1 phosphorylation on Ser-154 is the initial trigger.

Nox activator 1 (NoxA1) is a homologue of p67(phox) that acts in conjunction with Nox organizer 1 (NoxO1) to regulate reactive oxygen species (ROS) production by the NADPH oxidase Nox1. The phosphorylation of cytosolic regulatory components by multiple kinases plays important roles in assembly and activity of the phagocyte NADPH oxidase (Nox2) system, but little is known about regulation by phosphorylation in the Nox1 system. Here we identify Ser(172) and Ser(461) of NoxA1 as phosphorylation sites for protein kinase A (PKA). A consequence of this phosphorylation was the enhancement of NoxA1 complex formation with 14-3-3 proteins. Using both a transfected human embryonic kidney 293 cell Nox1 model system and endogenous Nox1 in colon cell lines, we showed that the elevation of cAMP inhibits, whereas the inhibition of PKA enhances, Nox1-dependent ROS production through effects on NoxA1. Inhibition of Nox1 activity was intensified by the availability of 14-3-3zeta protein, and this regulatory interaction was dependent on PKA-phosphorylatable sites at Ser(172) and Ser(461) in NoxA1. We showed that phosphorylation and 14-3-3 binding induce the dissociation of NoxA1 from the Nox1 complex at the plasma membrane, suggesting a mechanism for the inhibitory effect on Nox1 activity. Our data establish that PKA-phosphorylated NoxA1 is a new binding partner of 14-3-3 protein(s) and that this forms the basis of a novel mechanism regulating the formation of ROS by Nox1 and, potentially, other NoxA1-regulated Nox family members.

[PMID: 16762923]
Activation of the non-phagocytic superoxide-producing NADPH oxidase Nox1, complexed with p22(phox) at the membrane, requires its regulatory soluble proteins Noxo1 and Noxa1. However, the role of the small GTPase Rac remained to be clarified. Here we show that Rac directly participates in Nox1 activation via interacting with Noxa1. Electropermeabilized HeLa cells, ectopically expressing Nox1, Noxo1, and Noxa1, produce superoxide in a GTP-dependent manner, which is abrogated by expression of a mutant Noxa1(R103E), defective in Rac binding. Superoxide production in Nox1-expressing HeLa and Caco-2 cells is decreased by depletion or sequestration of Rac; on the other hand, it is enhanced by expression of the constitutively active Rac1(Q61L), but not by that of a mutant Rac1 with the A27K substitution, deficient in binding to Noxa1. We also demonstrate that Nox1 activation requires membrane recruitment of Noxa1, which is normally mediated via Noxa1 binding to Noxo1, a protein tethered to the Nox1 partner p22(phox): the Noxa1-Noxo1 and Noxo1-p22(phox) interactions are both essential for Nox1 activity. Rac likely facilitates the membrane localization of Noxa1: although Noxa1(W436R), defective in Noxo1 binding, neither associates with the membrane nor activates Nox1, the effects of the W436R substitution are restored by expression of Rac1(Q61L). The Rac-Noxa1 interaction also serves at a step different from the Noxa1 localization, because the binding-defective Noxa1(R103E), albeit targeted to the membrane, does not support superoxide production by Nox1. Furthermore, a mutant Noxa1 carrying the substitution of Ala for Val-205 in the activation domain, which is expected to undergo a conformational change upon Rac binding, fully localizes to the membrane but fails to activate Nox1.

[PMID: 16911517]
Activation of the superoxide-producing NADPH oxidase Nox1 requires both the organizer protein Noxo1 and the activator protein Noxa1. Here we describe an alternative splicing form of Noxo1, Noxo1gamma, which is expressed in the testis and fetal brain. The Noxo1gamma protein contains an additional five amino acids in the N-terminal PX domain, a phosphoinositide-binding module; the domain plays an essential role in supporting superoxide production by NADPH oxidase (Nox) family oxidases including Nox1, gp91(phox)/Nox2, and Nox3, as shown in this study. The PX domain isolated from Noxo1gamma shows a lower affinity for phosphoinositides than that from the classical splicing form Noxo1beta. Consistent with this, in resting cells, Noxo1gamma is poorly localized to the membrane, and thus less effective in activating Nox1 than Noxo1beta, which is constitutively present at the membrane. On the other hand, cell stimulation with phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA), an activator of Nox1-3, facilitates membrane translocation of Noxo1gamma; as a result, Noxo1gamma is equivalent to Noxo1beta in Nox1 activation in PMA-stimulated cells. The effect of the five-amino-acid insertion in the Noxo1 PX domain appears to depend on the type of Nox; in activation of gp91(phox)/Nox2, Noxo1gamma is less active than Noxo1beta even in the presence of PMA, whereas Noxo1gamma and Noxo1beta support the superoxide-producing activity of Nox3 to the same extent in a manner independent of cell stimulation.

The generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) is required for proper cell signaling, but must be tightly regulated to minimize deleterious oxidizing effects. Activation of the NADPH oxidases (Nox) triggers ROS production and, thus, regulatory mechanisms exist to properly control Nox activity. In this study, we report a novel mechanism in which Nox1 activity is regulated through the proteasomal degradation of Nox organizer 1 (NoxO1). We found that through the interaction between NoxO1 and growth receptor-bound protein 2 (Grb2), the Casitas B-lineage lymphoma (Cbl) E3 ligase was recruited, leading to decreased NoxO1 stability and a subsequent reduction in ROS generation upon epidermal growth factor (EGF) stimulation. Additionally, we show that EGF-mediated phosphorylation of NoxO1 induced its release from Grb2 and facilitated its association with Nox activator 1 (NoxA1) to stimulate ROS production. Consistently, overexpression of Grb2 resulted in decreased Nox1 activity, whereas knockdown of Grb2 led to increased Nox1 activity in response to EGF. CRISPR/Cas9-mediated NoxO1 knockout in human colon cancer cells abrogated anchorage-independent growth on soft agar and tumor-forming ability in athymic nude mice. Moreover, the expression and stability of NoxO1 were significantly increased in human colon cancer tissues compared with normal colon. Taken together, these results support a model whereby Nox1 activity and ROS generation are regulated by Grb2/Cbl-mediated proteolysis of NoxO1 in response to EGF, providing new insight into the processes by which excessive ROS production may promote oncogenic signaling to drive colorectal tumorigenesis.

NADPH oxidase (Nox) family enzymes are one of the main sources of cellular reactive oxygen species (ROS), which have been shown to function as second messenger molecules. To date, seven members of this family have been reported, including Nox1-5 and Duox1 and -2. With the exception of Nox2, the regulation of the Nox enzymes is still poorly understood. Nox1 is highly expressed in the colon, and it requires two cytosolic regulators, NoxO1 and NoxA1, as well as the binding of Rac1 GTPase, for its activity. In this study, we investigate the role of the tyrosine kinase c-Src in the regulation of ROS formation by Nox1. We show that c-Src induces Nox1-mediated ROS generation in the HT29 human colon carcinoma cell line through a Rac-dependent mechanism. Treatment of HT29 cells with the Src inhibitor PP2, expression of a kinase-inactive form of c-Src, and c-Src depletion by small interfering RNA (siRNA) reduce both ROS generation and the levels of active Rac1. This is associated with decreased Src-mediated phosphorylation and activation of the Rac1-guanine nucleotide exchange factor Vav2. Consistent with this, Vav2 siRNA that specifically reduces endogenous Vav2 protein is able to dramatically decrease Nox1-dependent ROS generation and abolish c-Src-induced Nox1 activity. Together, these results establish c-Src as an important regulator of Nox1 activity, and they may provide insight into the mechanisms of tumor formation in colon cancers.
