Stimulation of the T-cell antigen receptor (TCR) leads to the activation of signaling pathways that are essential for T-cell development and the response of mature T cells to antigens. The TCR has no intrinsic catalytic activity, but TCR engagement results in tyrosine phosphorylation of downstream targets by non-receptor tyrosine kinases. Three families of tyrosine kinases have long been recognized to play critical roles in TCR-dependent signaling. They are the Src, zeta-associated protein of 70 kDa, and Tec families of kinases. More recently, the Abelson (Abl) tyrosine kinases have been shown to be activated by TCR engagement and to be required for maximal TCR signaling. Using T-cell conditional knockout mice deficient for Abl family kinases, Abl (Abl1) and Abl-related gene (Arg) (Abl2), it was recently shown that loss of Abl kinases results in defective T-cell development and a partial block in the transition to the CD4(+)CD8(+) stage. Abl/Arg double null T cells exhibit impaired TCR-induced signaling, proliferation, and cytokine production. Moreover, conditional knockout mice lacking Abl and Arg in T cells exhibit impaired CD8(+) T-cell expansion in vivo upon Listeria monocytogenes infection. Thus, Abl kinase signaling is required for both T-cell development and mature T-cell function.

ABL-family proteins comprise one of the best conserved branches of the tyrosine kinases. Each ABL protein contains an SH3-SH2-TK (Src homology 3-Src homology 2-tyrosine kinase) domain cassette, which confers autoregulated kinase activity and is common among nonreceptor tyrosine kinases. This cassette is coupled to an actin-binding and -bundling domain, which makes ABL proteins capable of connecting phosphoregulation with actin-filament reorganization. Two vertebrate paralogs, ABL1 and ABL2, have evolved to perform specialized functions. ABL1 includes nuclear localization signals and a DNA binding domain through which it mediates DNA damage-repair functions, whereas ABL2 has additional binding capacity for actin and for microtubules to enhance its cytoskeletal remodeling functions. Several types of posttranslational modifications control ABL catalytic activity, subcellular localization, and stability, with consequences for both cytoplasmic and nuclear ABL functions. Binding partners provide additional regulation of ABL catalytic activity, substrate specificity, and downstream signaling. Information on ABL regulatory mechanisms is being mined to provide new therapeutic strategies against hematopoietic malignancies caused by BCR-ABL1 and related leukemogenic proteins.

The Abelson (ABL) family of nonreceptor tyrosine kinases, ABL1 and ABL2, transduces diverse extracellular signals to protein networks that control proliferation, survival, migration and invasion. ABL1 was first identified as an oncogene required for the development of leukaemias initiated by retroviruses or chromosome translocations. The demonstration that small-molecule ABL kinase inhibitors could effectively treat chronic myeloid leukaemia opened the door to the era of targeted cancer therapies. Recent reports have uncovered roles for ABL kinases in solid tumours. Enhanced ABL expression and activation in some solid tumours, together with altered cell polarity, invasion or growth induced by activated ABL kinases, suggest that drugs targeting these kinases may be useful for treating selected solid tumours.

Protein tyrosine kinases form a large family of signaling proteins implicated in both normal and malignant cell signaling. The aim of this study was to identify protein tyro-sine kinases that can transform hematopoietic cells to growth factor independent proliferation when constitutively activated by homodimerization. We used a modified retroviral insertion mutagenesis screen with a retroviral vector containing the homodimerization domain of ETV6 followed by an artificial splice donor site. Integration of this retroviral vector within a gene of the host genome would generate a fusion transcript containing the dimerization domain and part of the disrupted gene. Using this strategy with the IL3 dependent Ba/F3 cell line, we identified 8 different protein tyrosine kinases (Abl1, Fgfr1, Hck, Jak2, Lck, Mertk, Mst1r, Tnk1) that transformed the cells. These results characterize HCK, MERTK, MST1R and TNK1 as potential oncogenes and describe a method to identify gain-of-function fusion genes using a retroviral insertion screen.

Constitutively activated mutants of the non-receptor tyrosine kinases (TK) ABL1 (Abelson murine leukemia viral (v-abl) homolog (1) protein) and JAK2 (JAnus Kinase 2 or Just Another Kinase 2) play a central role in the pathogenesis of clinically and morphologically distinct chronic myeloproliferative disorders but are also found in some cases of de novo acute leukemia and lymphoma. Ligand-independent activation occurs as a consequence of point mutations or insertions/deletions within functionally relevant regulatory domains (JAK2) or the creation of TK fusion proteins by balanced reciprocal translocations, insertions or episomal amplification (ABL1 and JAK2). Specific abnormalities are correlated with clinical phenotype, although some are broad and encompass several World Health Organization-defined entities. TKs are excellent drug targets as exemplified by the activity of imatinib in BCR-ABL1-positive disease, particularly chronic myeloid leukemia. Resistance to imatinib is seen in a minority of cases and is often associated with the appearance of secondary point mutations within the TK domain of BCR-ABL1. These mutations are highly variable in their sensitivity to increased doses of imatinib or alternative TK inhibitors such as nilotinib or dasatinib. Selective and non-selective inhibitors of JAK2 are currently being developed, and encouraging data from pre-clinical experiments and initial phase-I studies regarding efficacy and potential toxicity of these compounds have already been reported.

Agrin signals through the muscle-specific receptor tyrosine kinase (MuSK) to cluster acetylcholine receptors (AChRs) on the postsynaptic membrane of the neuromuscular junction (NMJ). This stands as the prevailing model of synapse induction by a presynaptic factor, yet the agrin-dependent MuSK signaling cascade is largely undefined. Abl1 (previously known as Abl) and the Abl1-related gene product Abl2 (previously known as Arg) define a family of tyrosine kinases that regulate actin structure and presynaptic axon guidance. Here we show that the Abl kinases are critical mediators of postsynaptic assembly downstream of agrin and MuSK. In mouse muscle, Abl kinases were localized to the postsynaptic membrane of the developing NMJ. In cultured myotubes, Abl kinase activity was required for agrin-induced AChR clustering and enhancement of MuSK tyrosine phosphorylation. Moreover, MuSK and Abl kinases effected reciprocal tyrosine phosphorylation and formed a complex after agrin engagement. Our findings suggest that Abl kinases provide the developing synapse with the kinase activity required for signal amplification and the intrinsic cytoskeletal regulatory capacity required for assembly and remodeling.

The ABL1 proto-oncogene encodes a cytoplasmic and nuclear protein tyrosine kinase (c-Abl) that has been implicated in processes of cell differentiation, cell division, cell adhesion and stress response. Alterations of ABL1 by chromosomal rearrangement or viral transduction can lead to malignant transformation. Activity of the c-Abl protein is negatively regulated by its SH3 domain through an unknown mechanism, and deletion of the SH3 domain turns ABL1 into an oncogene. We present evidence for an intramolecular inhibitory interaction of the SH3 domain with the catalytic domain and with the linker between the SH2 and catalytic domain (SH2-CD linker). Site-directed mutations in each of these three elements activate c-Abl. Mutations in the linker cause a conformational change of the molecule and increase binding of the SH3 domain to peptide ligands. Individual mutation of two charged residues in the SH3 and catalytic domain activates c-Abl, while inhibition is restored in the double reciprocal mutant. We propose that regulators of c-Abl will have opposite effects on its activity depending on their ability to favour or disrupt these intramolecular interactions.

Chromosomal rearrangements involving the ABL1 gene, leading to a BCR-ABL1 fusion gene, have been mainly associated with chronic myeloid leukemia and B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL). At present, six other genes have been shown to fuse to ABL1. The kinase domain of ABL1 is retained in all chimeric proteins that are also composed of the N-terminal part of the partner protein that often includes a coiled-coil or a helix-loop-helix domain. These latter domains allow oligomerization of the protein that is required for tyrosine kinase activation, cytoskeletal localization, and neoplastic transformation. Fusion genes that have a break in intron 1 or 2 (BCR-ABL1, ETV6-ABL1, ZMIZ1-ABL1, EML1-ABL1, and NUP214-ABL1) have transforming activity, although NUP214-ABL1 requires amplification to be efficient. The NUP214-ABL1 gene is the second most prevalent fusion gene involving ABL1 in malignant hemopathies, with a frequency of 5% in T-cell ALL. Both fusion genes (SFPQ-ABL1 and RCSD1-ABL1) characterized by a break in intron 4 of ABL1 are associated with B-cell ALL, as the chimeric proteins lacked the SH2 domain of ABL1. Screening for ABL1 chimeric genes could be performed in patients with ALL, more particularly in those with T-cell ALL because ABL1 modulates T-cell development and plays a role in cytoskeletal remodeling processes in T cells.

ABL family tyrosine kinases are tightly regulated by autoinhibition and phosphorylation mechanisms. These kinases maintain an inactive conformation through intramolecular interactions involving SH3 and SH2 domains. RIN1, a downstream effector of RAS, binds to the ABL SH3 and SH2 domains and stimulates ABL tyrosine kinase activity. RIN1 binding to the ABL2 kinase resulted in a large decrease in Km and a small increase in Vmax toward an ABL consensus substrate peptide. The enzyme efficiency (k(cat)/Km) was increased more than 5-fold by RIN1. In addition, RIN1 strongly enhanced ABL-mediated phosphorylation of CRK, PSTPIP1, and DOK1, all established ABL substrates but with unique protein structures and distinct target sequences. Importantly RIN1-mediated stimulation of ABL kinase activity was independent of activation by SRC-mediated phosphorylation. RIN1 increased the kinase activity of both ABL1 and ABL2, and this occurred in the presence or absence of ABL regulatory domains outside the SH3-SH2-tyrosine kinase domain core. We further demonstrate that a catalytic site mutation associated with broad drug resistance, ABL1T315I, remains responsive to stimulation by RIN1. These findings are consistent with an allosteric kinase activation mechanism by which RIN1 binding promotes a more accessible ABL catalytic site through relief of autoinhibition. Direct disruption of RIN1 binding may therefore be a useful strategy to suppress the activity of normal and oncogenic ABL, including inhibitor-resistant mutants that confound current therapeutic strategies. Stimulation through derepression may be applicable to many other tyrosine kinases autoinhibited by coupled SH3 and SH2 domains.

The oncogenic BCR/ABL tyrosine kinase induces constitutive enhanced "spontaneous" DNA damage and unfaithful repair in Philadelphia chromosome positive leukemia cells. Here, we investigated the changes of protein profile in H2O2-induced DNA damage/repair in BaF3-MIGR1 and BaF3-BCR/ABL cells through a proteomic strategy consisting of two-dimensional gel electrophoresis (2-DE) coupled with MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry. In total, 41 spots were differentially expressed and 13 proteins were identified with further MS analysis. Two essential proteins, Proto-oncogene tyrosine-protein kinase ABL1 (c-ABL) and Heat shock 70kDa protein 4 (Apg-2), were confirmed by Western blot and showed consistent changes with proteomic results. Moreover, functional analysis demonstrated that inhibition of Apg-2 not only decreased cell proliferation, but also induced cell apoptosis in BCR/ABL positive cells (BaF3-BCR/ABL, BaF3-BCR/ABL(T315I)). We also proved that Apg-2 inhibition aggravated H2O2 induced damage in BCR/ABL positive cells, and enhanced the sensitivity of BaF3-BCR/ABL(T315I) to STI571. Taken together, the findings in this work provide us with some clues to a better understanding of the molecular mechanisms underlying BCR/ABL in the DNA damage/repair processes and demonstrated that Apg-2 would be a valid target for anti-leukemia drug development.
