On encountering a susceptible target, natural killer (NK) cells mediate cytotoxicity through highly regulated steps of directed degranulation. Cytotoxic granules converge at the microtubule organizing center and are polarized toward the immunological synapse (IS), followed by granule exocytosis. NK cell retargeting by chimeric antigen receptors (CARs) or mAbs represents a promising strategy for overcoming tumor cell resistance. However, little is known about the lytic granule dynamics of such retargeted NK cells toward NK-cell-resistant tumors. Here, we used spinning disk confocal microscopy for live-cell imaging to analyze granule-mediated NK cell cytotoxicity in ErbB2-targeted CAR-expressing NK-92 cells (NK-92/5.28.z) and high-affinity FcR transgenic NK-92 cells plus Herceptin toward ErbB2-positive breast cancer cells (MDA-MB-453), which are resistant to parental NK-92. Unmodified NK-92 cells cocultured with resistant cancer cells showed stable conjugate formation and granule clustering, but failed to polarize granules to the IS. In contrast, retargeting by CAR or FcR+Herceptin toward the MDA-MB-453 cells enabled granule polarization to the IS, resulting in highly effective cytotoxicity. We found that in NK-92 the phosphoinositide 3-kinase pathway was activated after contact with resistant MDA-MB-453, while phospholipase C-γ (PLCγ) and mitogen-activated protein kinase (MEK)/extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) were not activated. In contrast, retargeting by CAR or antibody-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity (ADCC) provided the missing PLCγ and MEK/ERK signals. These observations suggest that NK cells can create conjugates with resistant cancer cells and respond by granule clustering, but the activation signals are insufficient to induce granule polarization and consequent release of lytic enzymes. Retargeting by CAR and/or the FcR/mAb (ADCC) axis provide the necessary signals, leading to granule polarization and thereby overcoming tumor cell resistance.

ERBB2 is a proto-oncogene of multiple cancers including breast and gastric cancers with HER2 protein overexpression or gene amplification and has been proven clinically as a valid target for these cancers. HER2-targeting agents such as Herceptin®, Kadcyla® and ENHERTU® have been approved by the FDA for the treatment of breast cancer, but these drugs still face the challenge of acquired resistance and/or severe adverse reactions in clinical use. Therefore, there is significant unmet medical need for developing new agents that are more effective and safer for patients with advanced HER2-positive solid tumors including breast and gastric cancers. We report here the making of MRG002, a novel HER2-targeted antibody drug conjugate (ADC), and preclinical characterization including pharmacology, pharmacodynamics and toxicology and discuss its potential as a novel agent for treating patients with HER2-positive solid tumors. MRG002 exhibited similar antigen binding affinity but much reduced antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC) activity compared to trastuzumab. In addition to potent <i>in vitro</i> cytotoxicity, MRG002 showed tumor regression in both high- and medium-to-low HER2 expressing <i>in vivo</i> xenograft models. Furthermore, MRG002 showed enhanced antitumor activity when used in combination with an anti-PD-1 antibody. Main findings from toxicology studies are related to the payload and are consistent with literature report of other ADCs with monomethyl auristatinE. MRG002 has demonstrated a favorable toxicity profile and potent antitumor activities in the breast and gastric PDX models with varying levels of HER2 expression, and/or resistance to trastuzumab or T-DM1. A phase I clinical study of MRG002 in patients with HER2-positive solid tumors is ongoing (CTR20181778).
