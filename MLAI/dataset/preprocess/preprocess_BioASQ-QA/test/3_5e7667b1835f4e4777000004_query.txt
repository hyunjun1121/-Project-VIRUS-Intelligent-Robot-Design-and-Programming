What was the predominant rotavirus genotype in the pre-vaccine era, in Australia?

Introduction of rotavirus vaccines into national immunization programs (NIPs) could result in strain selection due to vaccine-induced selective pressure. This study describes the distribution and diversity of rotavirus genotypes before and after rotavirus vaccine introduction into the Australian NIP. State-based vaccine selection facilitated a unique comparison of diversity in RotaTeq and Rotarix vaccine states. From 1995 to 2015, the Australian Rotavirus Surveillance Program conducted genotypic analysis on 13051 rotavirus-positive samples from children <5 years of age, hospitalized with acute gastroenteritis. Rotavirus G and P genotypes were determined using serological and heminested multiplex reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction assays. G1P[8] was the dominant genotype nationally in the prevaccine era (1995-2006). Following vaccine introduction (2007-2015), greater genotype diversity was observed with fluctuating genotype dominance. Genotype distribution varied based on the vaccine implemented, with G12P[8] dominant in states using RotaTeq, and equine-like G3P[8] and G2P[4] dominant in states and territories using Rotarix. The increased diversity and differences in genotype dominance observed in states using RotaTeq (G12P[8]), and in states and territories using Rotarix (equine-like G3P[8] and G2P[4]), suggest that these vaccines exert different immunological pressures that influence the diversity of rotavirus strains circulating in Australia.

IntroductionRotavirus vaccination with the live-attenuated monovalent (a G1P[8] human rotavirus strain) two-dose Rotarix vaccine was introduced in England in July 2013. Since then, there have been significant reductions in rotavirus gastroenteritis incidence.AimWe assessed the vaccine's impact on rotavirus genotype distribution and diversity 3 years post-vaccine introduction.MethodsEpidemiological and microbiological data on genotyped rotavirus-positive samples between September 2006 and August 2016 were supplied by EuroRotaNet and Public Health England. Multinomial multivariable logistic regression adjusting for year, season and age was used to quantify changes in genotype prevalence in the vaccine period. Genotype diversity was measured using the Shannon's index (H') and Simpson's index of diversity (D).ResultsWe analysed genotypes from 8,044 faecal samples. In the pre-vaccine era, G1P[8] was most prevalent, ranging from 39% (411/1,057) to 74% (527/709) per year. In the vaccine era, G1P[8] prevalence declined each season (35%, 231/654; 12%, 154/1,257; 5%, 34/726) and genotype diversity increased significantly in 6-59 months old children (H' p < 0.001: D p < 0.001). In multinomial analysis, G2P[4] (adjusted multinomial odds ratio (aMOR): 9.51; 95% confidence interval (CI): 7.02-12.90), G3P[8] (aMOR: 2.83; 95% CI: 2.17-3.81), G12P[8] (aMOR: 2.46; 95% CI: 1.62-3.73) and G4P[8] (aMOR: 1.42; 95% CI: 1.02-1.96) significantly increased relative to G1P[8].ConclusionsIn the context of reduced rotavirus disease incidence, genotype diversity has increased, with a relative change in the dominant genotype from G1P[8] to G2P[4] after vaccine introduction. These changes will need continued surveillance as the number and age of vaccinated birth cohorts increase in the future.

Since 2006, the New Vaccine Surveillance Network has conducted active, population-based surveillance for acute gastroenteritis (AGE) hospitalizations and emergency department (ED) visits in 3 United States counties. Trends in the epidemiology and disease burden of rotavirus hospitalizations and ED visits were examined from 2006 to 2016. Children < 3 years of age hospitalized or visiting the ED with AGE were enrolled from January 2006 through June 2016. Bulk stool specimens were collected and tested for rotavirus. Rotavirus-associated hospitalization and ED visit rates were calculated annually with 2006-2007 defined as the prevaccine period and 2008-2016 as the postvaccine period. Rotavirus genotype trends were compared over time. Over 11 seasons, 6954 children with AGE were enrolled and submitted a stool specimen (2187 hospitalized and 4767 in the ED). Comparing pre- and postvaccine periods, the proportion of children with rotavirus dramatically declined for hospitalization (49% vs 10%) and ED visits (49% vs 8%). In the postvaccine era, a biennial pattern of rotavirus rates was observed, with a trend toward an older median age. G1P[8] (63%) was the predominant genotype in the prevaccine period with a significantly lower proportion (7%) in the postvaccine period (P < .001). G2P[4] remained stable (8% to 14%) in both periods, whereas G3P[8] and G12P[8] increased in proportion from pre- to postvaccine periods (1% to 25% and 17% to 40%), respectively. The epidemiology and disease burden of rotavirus has been altered by rotavirus vaccination with a biennial disease pattern, sustained low rates of rotavirus in children < 3 years of age, and a shift in the residual genotypes from G1P[8] to other genotypes.
