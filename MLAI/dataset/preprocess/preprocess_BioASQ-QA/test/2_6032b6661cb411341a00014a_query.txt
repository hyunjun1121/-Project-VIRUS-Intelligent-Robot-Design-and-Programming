Which human tissue synthesize CRP?

In conditions of acute and chronic inflammation hepatic detoxification capacity is severely impaired due to coordinated downregulation of drug metabolizing enzymes and transporters. Using global transcriptome analysis of liver tissue from donors with pathologically elevated C-reactive protein (CRP), we observed comparable extent of positive and negative acute phase response, where the top upregulated gene sets included immune response and defense pathways while downregulation occurred mostly in metabolic and catabolic pathways including many important drug metabolizing enzymes and transporters. We hypothesized that microRNAs (miRNA), which usually act as negative regulators of gene expression, contribute to this process. Microarray and quantitative real-time PCR analyses identified differentially expressed miRNAs in liver tissues from donors with elevated CRP, cholestasis, steatosis, or non-alcoholic steatohepatitis. Using luciferase reporter constructs harboring native and mutated 3'-untranslated gene regions, several predicted miRNA binding sites on RXRÎ± (miR-130b-3p), CYP2C8 (miR-452-5p), CYP2C9 (miR-155-5p), CYP2C19 (miR-155-5p, miR-6807-5p), and CYP3A4 (miR-224-5p) were validated. HepaRG cells transfected with miRNA mimics showed coordinate reductions in mRNA levels and several cytochrome P450 enzyme activities particularly for miR-155-5p, miR-452-5p, and miR-6807-5p, the only miRNA that was deregulated in all four pathological conditions. Furthermore we observed strong negative correlations between liver tissue miRNA levels and hepatic CYP phenotypes. Since miR-155 is well known for its multifunctional roles in immunity, inflammation, and cancer, our data suggest that this and other miRNAs contribute to coordinated downregulation of drug metabolizing enzymes and transporters in inflammatory conditions.

C-reactive Protein (CRP) is an acute phase reactant, belonging to the pentraxin family of proteins. Its level rises up to 1000-fold in response to acute inflammation. High sensitivity CRP level is utilized as an independent biomarker of inflammation and cardiovascular disease. The accumulating data suggests that CRP has two distinct forms. It is predominantly produced in the liver in a native pentameric form (nCRP). At sites of local inflammation and tissue injury it may bind to phosphocholine-rich membranes of activated and apoptotic cells and their microparticles, undergoing irreversible dissociation to five monomeric subunits, termed monomeric CRP (mCRP). Through dissociation, CRP deposits into tissues and acquires distinct proinflammatory properties. It activates both classic and alternative complement pathways, binding complement component C1q and factor H. mCRP actively participates in the development of endothelial dysfunction. It activates leukocytes, inducing cytokine release and monocyte recruitment. It may also play a role in the polarization of monocytes and T cells into proinflammatory phenotypes. It may be involved in low-density lipoproteins (LDL) opsonization and uptake by macrophages. mCRP deposits were detected in samples of atherosclerotic lesions from human aorta, carotid, coronary and femoral arteries. mCRP may also induce platelet aggregation and thrombus formation, thus contributing in multiple ways in the development of atherosclerosis and atherothrombosis. In this mini-review, we will provide an insight into the process of conformational rearrangement of nCRP, leading to dissociation, and describe known effects of mCRP. We will provide a rationalization for mCRP involvement in the development of atherosclerosis and atherothrombosis.
