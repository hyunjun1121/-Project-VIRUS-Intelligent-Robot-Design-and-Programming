What is the target of galcanezumab?

[PMID: 30341990]
To characterize adult patients with episodic migraine who achieved 100% response to galcanezumab treatment. Galcanezumab is a humanized monoclonal antibody that selectively binds to the calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP) and has demonstrated efficacy in reducing migraine headache days (MHD) in patients with episodic and chronic migraine. A post hoc analysis of the proportion of patients with 100% response (100% reduction from baseline in monthly MHD) was calculated for each month from pooled data of 2 double-blind, 6-month galcanezumab studies in patients with episodic migraine (4 to 14 MHD and ≥2 migraine attacks per month at baseline). The patients were randomized (1:1:2) to monthly subcutaneous galcanezumab, 120 mg (after 240 mg initial loading dose) or 240 mg, or placebo. A generalized linear mixed model with effects for baseline MHD, treatment, month, and treatment-by-month interaction was used to estimate the mean monthly response rate. The analysis included 1739 patients treated with galcanezumab, 120 mg (n = 436) or 240 mg (n = 428), or placebo (n = 875). The mean monthly 100% response rate on an average month in the 6-month double-blind phase was greater for galcanezumab 120 mg (13.5%) and 240 mg (14.3%) groups vs placebo (5.9%) with odds ratios of 2.5 (95% confidence interval [CI] 1.9, 3.2) and 2.6 (95% CI 2.0, 3.4), respectively (P < .001). The rate of 100% monthly response increased at each month over the 6-month double-blind phase with higher rates for galcanezumab dose groups (9 to 21%) than placebo (2 to 10%) (P < .02). Evaluation of 100% response by the number of months showed a greater proportion of galcanezumab-treated patients in either dose group, compared to placebo, were able to achieve a 100% response (P < .001 up to 3 months); however, though greater than placebo, few galcanezumab patients had ≥4 months of 100% response (P < .02). The proportions of patients with 100% response were greatest in the last 3 months of the treatment. Considering the average number days between nonconsecutive MHD across the 6-month period (not just during the times of 100% response), the duration of migraine headache-free periods in the galcanezumab groups was 29 days for those with at least 1 month of 100% response and 55 days for those with at least 3 months of 100% response. This gap was approximately 6 to 11 times greater than the mean gap of 5 days observed at baseline. More than a third of the patients with episodic migraine treated with galcanezumab 120 mg or 240 mg achieved 100% response for at least 1 month. More patients had 100% monthly response in the last 3 months of the 6-month double-blind period. For those with 100% response for at least 1 month, the average time between nonconsecutive MHD for the entire treatment period was nearly 1 month and approached 2 months for patients with 3 or more months of 100% response.

Growth in knowledge about calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP) in the pathophysiology of migraine brought CGRP antagonism to headache medicine. Failures in development of small molecule CGRP receptor antagonists and increasing knowledge and use of monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) in medicine led to the breakthrough development of large molecule anti-CGRP mAbs: eptinezumab, erenumab, fremanezumab, and galcanezumab. This specifics about CGRP immunology aims to outline: (1) knowledge needed for CGRP antagonism and (2) developmental issues of specific CGRP antagonists for provider use. This clinically oriented review documents IgG structure and function; state of the art of monoclonal IgG production and ligand-antigen-antibodies in migraine therapeutics contributing to immunogenic risks and off-target toxicities. Specifics to CGRP ligand, receptor, antagonism, and molecules, small and large, complete this review. Completion will facilitate assessment of the similarities, differences, and application of the forthcoming anti-CGRP receptor and ligand antagonists for patients.

To evaluate onset of effect of galcanezumab in patients with episodic migraine. Galcanezumab is a monoclonal antibody that binds to calcitonin gene-related peptide and is indicated for preventive treatment of migraine. Data on the primary outcome measure were analyzed from 2 previously published double-blind, Phase 3 studies (EVOLVE-1 [N = 858] and EVOLVE-2 [N = 915]) wherein adult patients with episodic migraine were randomized to receive monthly subcutaneous injections of galcanezumab 120 mg (with 240-mg loading dose) or 240 mg or placebo for up to 6 months. Monthly onset of effect was defined as the earliest month at which galcanezumab achieved and subsequently maintained statistical superiority to placebo on the mean change from baseline in the number of monthly migraine headache days (MHDs). If onset occurred in Month 1, weekly onset was evaluated and defined as the earliest week at which galcanezumab statistically separated from placebo and maintained statistical separation for remaining weeks in that month. Day of onset of effect was also analyzed, as were monthly and weekly onset, for occurrence of ≥50% reduction from baseline in number of MHDs. For both studies, change from baseline in monthly MHDs showed a statistically significant separation of galcanezumab from placebo at Month 1 and each subsequent month (each P < .001). Analysis of the first month for both studies indicated onset of effect in the first week, with galcanezumab-treated patients having significantly higher odds of having fewer MHDs in the first week (odds ratio [95% confidence interval] for EVOLVE-1, 2.71 [2.00, 3.66], and for EVOLVE-2, 2.88 [2.16, 3.86]; both P < .001) and each subsequent week compared with placebo-treated patients (P ≤ .004). Daily analysis showed onset of effect at Day 1 (first day after injection day). Galcanezumab also demonstrated superiority to placebo on occurrence of ≥50% reduction in MHDs starting at Week 1 (percentage of patients with 50% response in galcanezumab group vs placebo group for EVOLVE-1, 54.3% vs 32.4% [P < .001], and for EVOLVE-2, 59.4% vs 38.0% [P < .001]). Rapid onset of preventive effect on the first day after injection of galcanezumab was confirmed in both studies of episodic migraine.

To review pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic characteristics of antibodies that bind to soluble ligands within the framework of calcitonin gene-related peptide antibodies. Calcitonin gene-related peptide has been implicated in the pathophysiology of migraine. Galcanezumab is an antibody that binds to the ligand calcitonin gene-related peptide. Other antibodies that target calcitonin gene-related peptide include eptinezumab and fremanezumab. To understand how antibodies can affect the extent and duration of free ligand concentrations, it is important to consider the dose and pharmacokinetics of an antibody, and the kinetics of the ligand and antibody-ligand complex. Insights regarding the pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic properties of galcanezumab as a probe antibody drug and calcitonin gene-related peptide as its binding ligand regarding its clinical outcomes are provided. Antibodies are administered parenterally because oral absorption is limited by gastrointestinal degradation and inefficient diffusion through the epithelium. The systemic absorption of antibodies following intramuscular or subcutaneous administration most likely occurs via convective transport through lymphatic vessels into blood. The majority of antibody elimination occurs via intracellular catabolism into peptides and amino acids following endocytosis. Binding of ligand to an antibody reduces the free ligand that is available to interact with the receptor and efficacy is driven by the magnitude and duration of the reduction in free ligand concentration. A galcanezumab pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic model shows that galcanezumab decreases free calcitonin gene-related peptide concentrations in a dose- and time-dependent manner and continues to suppress free calcitonin gene-related peptide with repeated dosing. The model provides evidence for a mechanistic linkage to galcanezumab therapeutic effects for the preventive treatment of migraine.

Background Safety findings from a Phase 2b study of galcanezumab, a humanized monoclonal antibody against calcitonin gene-related peptide, for prevention of migraine (NCT02163993) are reported here. Methods Patients aged 18-65 years with episodic migraine were evaluated in this multicenter, double-blind, randomized study. After randomization, 410 patients were administered 5, 50, 120 or 300 mg of galcanezumab or placebo subcutaneously once every 4 weeks for 12 weeks, followed by a post-treatment off-drug period lasting 12 weeks. Results Treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAEs) were primarily rated as mild to moderate. Serious adverse events reported in galcanezumab dose groups were appendicitis, Crohn's disease, suicidal ideation, and congenital ankyloglossia in an infant of a paternal pregnancy; each of these were reported by one patient. Adverse events leading to discontinuation with galcanezumab treatment were abdominal pain, visual impairment, and upper limb fracture, each reported by one patient. Treatment-emergent injection-site reactions were reported significantly more frequently ( p = 0.013) with galcanezumab (13.9%) than with placebo (5.8%). Injection-site pain was the most common injection-site reaction (galcanezumab 11.4%; placebo 2.9%, p = 0.004). Upper respiratory tract infection (galcanezumab 10.0%; placebo 8.8%) and nasopharyngitis (galcanezumab 7.0%; placebo 2.2%) also occurred more frequently with galcanezumab treatment. Potential hypersensitivity events were reported at similar frequencies in galcanezumab (3.3%) and placebo (5.1%) groups. Incidence of treatment-emergent anti-drug antibodies in galcanezumab dose groups (4.6% of patients during treatment period) did not appear to have any meaningful effects on safety, the pharmacokinetics of galcanezumab, or its ability to bind to the target ligand. Conclusion The results from this 3-month Phase 2b study support the initiation of larger Phase 3 trials of longer duration.

Monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) targeting the calcitonin-gene-related peptide (CGRP) pathway have been developed for episodic and chronic migraine prevention, either through binding the CGRP ligand (eptinezumab, fremanezumab, galcanezumab) or the CGRP receptor (erenumab). We provide an update on published Phase 2 and Phase 3 trials, safety/tolerability data, pharmacokinetics and mechanism of action of these biologicals. The efficacy data from Phase 2 trials are corroborated by those from published Phase 3 trials, with a multitude of publications expected in 2018. Review of safety data concluded there was no difference in total adverse events or main adverse events (including upper respiratory tract infection, nasopharyngitis, nausea, injection-site pain and back pain) between the mAbs and placebo injections except apparently for dizziness. The site of action of these mAbs is not fully elucidated but current insight is that their effect resides in the periphery; a contribution of central effect(s) can however not be excluded at present. Although efficacy of all four drugs is modest over placebo in episodic and chronic migraine prevention and overall comparable with available oral preventive treatments, current tolerability and (short-term) safety data of this new treatment approach certainly promise a major step forward for migraine patients.

Galcanezumab-gnlm (Emgality™; Eli Lilly and Company), hereafter galcanezumab, is a humanized monoclonal antibody against the calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP) ligand. A potent vasodilator, CGRP is implicated in nociceptive transmission and migraine pathogenesis. In September 2018, the US FDA approved galcanezumab as a once-monthly subcutaneous injection for the preventive treatment of migraine in adults. In the same month, the EMA issued a positive opinion for galcanezumab for the prophylaxis of migraine in adults who have at least 4 migraine days per month. Galcanezumab is also undergoing phase III evaluation for the preventive treatment of cluster headache in North America and Europe. This article summarizes the milestones in the development of galcanezumab leading to its first approval for the preventive treatment of migraine in adults.

Treatment of migraine is on the cusp of a new era with the development of drugs that target the trigeminal sensory neuropeptide calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP) or its receptor. Several of these drugs are expected to receive approval for use in migraine headache in 2018 and 2019. CGRP-related therapies offer considerable improvements over existing drugs as they are the first to be designed specifically to act on the trigeminal pain system, they are more specific and they seem to have few or no adverse effects. CGRP receptor antagonists such as ubrogepant are effective for acute relief of migraine headache, whereas monoclonal antibodies against CGRP (eptinezumab, fremanezumab and galcanezumab) or the CGRP receptor (erenumab) effectively prevent migraine attacks. As these drugs come into clinical use, we provide an overview of knowledge that has led to successful development of these drugs. We describe the biology of CGRP signalling, summarize key clinical evidence for the role of CGRP in migraine headache, including the efficacy of CGRP-targeted treatment, and synthesize what is known about the role of CGRP in the trigeminovascular system. Finally, we consider how the latest findings provide new insight into the central role of the trigeminal ganglion in the pathophysiology of migraine.

In the last 15 years relevant efforts have been made to demonstrate that calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP) antagonism is a valuable and druggable mechanism for treatment or prevention of migraine. Galcanezumab is one of the antibodies developed and studied to prevent migraine by targeting CGRP. The scope of this review is to report data currently available on galcanezumab. According to available data, galcanezumab is safe and efficacious in preventing migraine in episodic migraine patients, also reducing disability and functional impairment due to the disorder. In September 2018, galcanezumab was approved in the USA for the prevention of migraine in adults. The placement of galcanezumab into the current therapeutic scenario will be a revolution for migraine patients, and probably in a less near future also for patients affected by other primary headaches.

<b>Background:</b> Calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP) is pivotal in the pathophysiology of migraine headaches and represents a promising target for migraine treatment. The humanized monoclonal antibody galcanezumab (LY2951742) binds to CGRP and may be effective in migraine prophylaxis. <b>Objectives:</b> The primary objective was to evaluate the safety and tolerability of single and multiple doses of galcanezumab in humans. Secondary objectives included assessing the pharmacokinetics and evaluating target engagement. <b>Methods:</b> A double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled study (NCT 01337596) with single escalating and multiple subcutaneous (SC) doses of galcanezumab was performed in healthy male volunteers. Single doses of 1, 5, 25, 75, 200, and 600 mg of galcanezumab (<i>n</i> = 7/dose) or placebo (<i>n</i> = 2/dose) were injected SC in six consecutive cohorts of nine subjects each. One cohort of nine subjects received multiple (4) 150 mg doses of galcanezumab or placebo every other week. Target engagement was evaluated by measuring inhibition of capsaicin-induced increase in dermal blood flow (DBF). <b>Findings:</b> Sixty-three subjects were randomized and included in the safety analyses. Galcanezumab was well tolerated in single doses (1-600 mg SC) and consecutive doses (150 mg SC). There was no dose-dependent difference in type or frequency of treatment-emergent adverse events, and no clinically meaningful difference when compared with placebo. Pharmacokinetics were linear. Galcanezumab induced a robust, dose-dependent, and durable inhibition of capsaicin-induced increase in DBF, supporting the continued clinical development of galcanezumab for prophylaxis in migraine patients.

Galcanezumab (LY2951742), a monoclonal antibody against calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP), is one of a novel class of new medicines for migraine prevention. To assess whether at least 1 dose of galcanezumab was superior to placebo for episodic migraine prevention. A randomized clinical trial was conducted in the United States (July 7, 2014, to August 19, 2015) in clinics of 37 licensed physicians with a specialty including, but not limited to, psychiatry, neurology, internal medicine, and primary care. Subcutaneous injections of galcanezumab, 5, 50, 120, or 300 mg, or placebo were given monthly during the 3-month treatment period. A total of 936 patients were assessed; 526 did not meet study entry or baseline criteria and 410 patients were randomly assigned to receive placebo or galcanezumab. Analyses were conducted on an intent-to-treat population, which included all patients who were randomized and received at least 1 dose of study drug. Short-term migraine treatments were allowed as needed except for opioids or barbiturates. To determine if at least 1 of the 4 doses of galcanezumab tested was superior to placebo for migraine prevention measured by the mean change from baseline in the number of migraine headache days 9 weeks to 12 weeks after randomization. Of the 936 patients assessed, 410 met entry criteria (aged 18-65 years with 4-14 migraine headache days per month and migraine onset prior to age 50 years) and were randomized to receive placebo or galcanezumab. For the primary end point, galcanezumab, 120 mg, significantly reduced migraine headache days compared with placebo (99.6% posterior probability -4.8 days; 90% BCI, -5.4 to -4.2 days vs 95% superiority threshold [Bayesian analysis] -3.7 days; 90% BCI, -4.1 to -3.2 days). Adverse events reported by 5% or more of patients in at least 1 galcanezumab dose group and more frequently than placebo included injection-site pain, upper respiratory tract infection, nasopharyngitis, dysmenorrhea, and nausea. Monthly subcutaneous injections of galcanezumab, both 120 mg and 300 mg, demonstrated efficacy (repeated-measures analysis) for the preventive treatment of migraine and support further development in larger phase 3 studies. All dosages were safe and well tolerated for the preventive treatment of episodic migraine. clinicaltrials.gov Identifier: NCT02163993.

Patients with high-frequency episodic migraine (HFEM) have a greater disease burden than those with low-frequency episodic migraine (LFEM). Acute treatment overuse increases the risk of migraine chronification in patients with HFEM. Galcanezumab, a humanized monoclonal antibody binding calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP), is effective for migraine prevention with a favorable safety profile. Here, we investigate whether there are differences in galcanezumab efficacy in patients with LFEM or with HFEM. Data were pooled from two double-blind, placebo-controlled phase 3 trials; EVOLVE-1 and EVOLVE-2. Patients were 18-65 years old, experienced 4-14 monthly migraine headache days (MHDs) for ≥1 year prior, with onset at < 50 years of age. Migraine headaches were tracked via electronic patient-reported outcome system and randomization was stratified by low (LFEM; 4-7 monthly MHDs) or high (HFEM; 8-14 monthly MHDs) frequency. Subgroup analysis compared the HFEM and LFEM subgroups with a linear or generalized linear mixed model repeated measures approach. The intent-to-treat patients (N = 1773) had a mean age of 41.3 years, were mostly white (75%), female (85%), and 66% of patients had HFEM. In both the LFEM and HFEM subgroups, the overall (Months 1-6) and monthly changes from baseline in monthly MHDs and monthly MHDs with acute medication use compared with placebo were statistically significantly reduced for galcanezumab 120-mg and 240-mg. Galcanezumab (120-mg and 240-mg) significantly decreased the overall and monthly MHDs with nausea and/or vomiting, and with photophobia and phonophobia versus placebo in patients with LFEM or HFEM. In both subgroups, the mean overall (Months 1-6) and monthly percentages of patients with ≥50%, ≥75%, and 100% reduction in monthly MHDs from baseline were statistically significantly greater in patients receiving either dose of galcanezumab versus placebo. Galcanezumab (120-mg and 240-mg) significantly improved the Migraine-Specific Quality of Life Questionnaire role function-restrictive domain score as well as the Migraine Disability Assessment total score versus placebo for patients with LFEM or HFEM. There were no significant subgroup-by-treatment interactions. Galcanezumab was as effective in patients with HFEM as in those with LFEM. Associated symptoms, quality of life, and disability were similarly improved in patients with HFEM or LFEM. NCT02614183 , NCT02614196 .

The neuropeptide calcitonin gene-related peptide is well established as a key player in the pathogenesis of migraine. Clinical studies show calcitonin gene-related peptide levels correlate with migraine attacks, and decreases in this neuropeptide can indicate antimigraine therapy effectiveness. Research has revealed a wide distribution of expression sites for calcitonin gene-related peptide in the central and peripheral nervous system. Of these, the calcitonin gene-related peptide receptor, which binds calcitonin gene-related peptide with high affinity, has attracted growing interest as a viable target for antimigraine therapies. An incentive to pursue such research is the continuing unmet medical need of patients. Triptans have offered some clinical benefit, but many patients do not respond and these drugs have important safety considerations. Initial calcitonin gene-related peptide-focused research led to development of the "gepant" small-molecule calcitonin gene-related peptide receptor blockers. Positive efficacy reports concerning the gepants have been tempered by safety findings which led to the discontinuation of some of these agents. Currently, there is considerable excitement regarding monoclonal antibodies against calcitonin gene-related peptide (eptinezumab, galcanezumab, fremanezumab) and the calcitonin gene-related peptide receptor (erenumab). To date, these monoclonal antibodies have shown promising efficacy in clinical trials, with no major safety concerns. If ongoing long-term studies show that their efficacy can be maintained, this may herald a new era for effective antimigraine therapies.

Introduction Galcanezumab is a humanized monoclonal antibody binding calcitonin gene-related peptide, used for migraine prevention. Methods A global, double-blind, 6-month study of patients with episodic migraine was undertaken with 915 intent-to-treat patients randomized to monthly galcanezumab 120 mg (n = 231) or 240 mg (n = 223) or placebo (n = 461) subcutaneous injections. Primary endpoint was overall mean change from baseline in monthly migraine headache days. Key secondary endpoints were ≥50%,  ≥ 75%, and 100% response rates; monthly migraine headache days with acute migraine medication use; Patient Global Impression of Severity rating; the Role Function-Restrictive score of the Migraine-Specific Quality of Life Questionnaire. Results Mean monthly migraine headache days were reduced by 4.3 and 4.2 days by galcanezumab 120 and 240 mg, respectively, and 2.3 days by placebo. The group differences (95% CIs) versus placebo were 2.0 (-2.6, -1.5) and 1.9 (-2.4, -1.4), respectively. Both doses were superior to placebo for all key secondary endpoints. Injection site pain was the most common treatment-emergent adverse event, reported at similar rates in all treatment groups. Both galcanezumab doses had significantly more injection site reactions and injection site pruritus, and the 240 mg group had significantly more injection site erythema versus placebo. Conclusions Galcanezumab 120 or 240 mg given once monthly was efficacious, safe, and well tolerated. Study identification EVOLVE-2; NCT02614196; https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT02614196 .

Galcanezumab is a humanized immunoglobulin G (IgG) monoclonal antibody (mAb) indicated for the prevention of migraine that binds to calcitonin gene-related peptide. A population pharmacokinetic (PK) analysis was performed to characterize galcanezumab PK using data pooled from 7 clinical studies. Clinical studies included healthy individuals and patients with episodic or chronic migraine who were administered between 5 and 300 mg galcanezumab. The PK data were analyzed using nonlinear mixed-effects modeling. Galcanezumab concentration-time data were described with a 1-compartment model with first-order absorption following subcutaneous administration and linear elimination. At the median body weight of 74 kg, the estimated population apparent clearance (CL/F) was 0.00785 L/h (34% IIV), the apparent volume of distribution was 7.33 L (34% IIV), and half-life was 27 days. Patient body weight was found to have a modest effect of CL/F, with median galcanezumab concentrations being lower in the heaviest patients compared to the lightest patients, but this outcome was determined not to be clinically relevant in the context of model-estimated random variability. Dosing adjusted for body weight is not warranted in adults. Age, sex, race/ethnicity, immunogenicity, renal/hepatic markers, and injection-site location did not affect galcanezumab PK. In conclusion, galcanezumab exhibits PK parameters typical for an IgG mAb administered subcutaneously. The population PK model developed in this study demonstrates that galcanezumab exhibits linear PK that was not influenced in a clinically relevant manner by the patient factors evaluated.

Episodic cluster headache is a disabling neurologic disorder that is characterized by daily headache attacks that occur over periods of weeks or months. Galcanezumab, a humanized monoclonal antibody to calcitonin gene-related peptide, may be a preventive treatment for cluster headache. We enrolled patients who had at least one attack every other day, at least four total attacks, and no more than eight attacks per day during a baseline assessment, as well as a history of cluster headache periods lasting at least 6 weeks, and randomly assigned them to receive galcanezumab (at a dose of 300 mg) or placebo, administered subcutaneously at baseline and at 1 month. The primary end point was the mean change from baseline in the weekly frequency of cluster headache attacks across weeks 1 through 3 after receipt of the first dose. The key secondary end point was the percentage of patients who had a reduction from baseline of at least 50% in the weekly frequency of cluster headache attacks at week 3. Safety was also assessed. Recruitment was halted before the trial reached the planned sample size of 162 because too few volunteers met the eligibility criteria. Of 106 enrolled patients, 49 were randomly assigned to receive galcanezumab and 57 to receive placebo. The mean (±SD) number of cluster headache attacks per week in the baseline period was 17.8±10.1 in the galcanezumab group and 17.3±10.1 in the placebo group. The mean reduction in the weekly frequency of cluster headache attacks across weeks 1 through 3 was 8.7 attacks in the galcanezumab group, as compared with 5.2 in the placebo group (difference, 3.5 attacks per week; 95% confidence interval, 0.2 to 6.7; P = 0.04). The percentage of patients who had a reduction of at least 50% in headache frequency at week 3 was 71% in the galcanezumab group and 53% in the placebo group. There were no substantial between-group differences in the incidence of adverse events, except that 8% of the patients in the galcanezumab group had injection-site pain. Galcanezumab administered subcutaneously at a dose of 300 mg once monthly reduced the weekly frequency of attacks of episodic cluster headache across weeks 1 through 3 after the initial injection, as compared with placebo.
