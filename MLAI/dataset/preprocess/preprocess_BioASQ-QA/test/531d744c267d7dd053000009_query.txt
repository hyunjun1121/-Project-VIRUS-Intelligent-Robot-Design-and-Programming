Spermiogenesis is a postmeiotic process that drives development of round spermatids into fully elongated spermatozoa. Spermatid elongation is largely controlled post-transcriptionally after global silencing of mRNA synthesis from the haploid genome. Here, rats that differentially express EGFP from a lentiviral transgene during early and late steps of spermiogenesis were used to flow sort fractions of round and elongating spermatids. Mass-spectral analysis of 2D gel protein spots enriched >3-fold in each fraction revealed a heterogeneous RNA binding proteome (hnRNPA2/b1, hnRNPA3, hnRPDL, hnRNPK, hnRNPL, hnRNPM, PABPC1, PABPC4, PCBP1, PCBP3, PTBP2, PSIP1, RGSL1, RUVBL2, SARNP2, TDRD6, TDRD7) abundantly expressed in round spermatids prior to their elongation. Notably, each protein within this ontology cluster regulates alternative splicing, sub-cellular transport, degradation and/or translational repression of mRNAs. In contrast, elongating spermatid fractions were enriched with glycolytic enzymes, redox enzymes and protein synthesis factors. Retrogene-encoded proteins were over-represented among the most abundant elongating spermatid factors identified. Consistent with these biochemical activities, plus corresponding histological profiles, the identified RNA processing factors are predicted to collectively drive post-transcriptional expression of an alternative exome that fuels finishing steps of sperm maturation and fitness.

Cytoplasmic poly(A) binding protein 4 (PABPC4) is an RNA-processing protein that plays an important role in the regulation of gene expression. The aim of this study was to investigate the expression pattern and identify the potential clinical significance of PABPC4 in colorectal cancer. Immunohistochemical analysis revealed that 26.7% (27/101 patients) of primary colorectal tumors and 60.5% (23/38 patients) of corresponding adjacent, normal tissues showed high cytoplasmic expression of PABPC4, whereas expression was absent in 98% (43/44 patients) of distant, normal tissues. Using Kaplan-Meier analysis, we observed that the expression of PABPC4 was significantly correlated with disease-free survival and overall survival in patients with stage II and stage III colorectal cancer (P=0.022 and P=0.020, respectively). PABPC4 expression was positively associated with survival outcome, and may have predictive value in the prognosis of patients with colorectal cancer. Taken together, our findings indicate that PABPC4 may play a role in the pathogenesis of colorectal cancer.

C-reactive protein (CRP) is a heritable marker of chronic inflammation that is strongly associated with cardiovascular disease. We sought to identify genetic variants that are associated with CRP levels. We performed a genome-wide association analysis of CRP in 66 185 participants from 15 population-based studies. We sought replication for the genome-wide significant and suggestive loci in a replication panel comprising 16 540 individuals from 10 independent studies. We found 18 genome-wide significant loci, and we provided evidence of replication for 8 of them. Our results confirm 7 previously known loci and introduce 11 novel loci that are implicated in pathways related to the metabolic syndrome (APOC1, HNF1A, LEPR, GCKR, HNF4A, and PTPN2) or the immune system (CRP, IL6R, NLRP3, IL1F10, and IRF1) or that reside in regions previously not known to play a role in chronic inflammation (PPP1R3B, SALL1, PABPC4, ASCL1, RORA, and BCL7B). We found a significant interaction of body mass index with LEPR (P<2.9×10(-6)). A weighted genetic risk score that was developed to summarize the effect of risk alleles was strongly associated with CRP levels and explained ≈5% of the trait variance; however, there was no evidence for these genetic variants explaining the association of CRP with coronary heart disease. We identified 18 loci that were associated with CRP levels. Our study highlights immune response and metabolic regulatory pathways involved in the regulation of chronic inflammation.

In vertebrates, poly(A) binding protein (PABP) is known to exist in five different isoforms. PABPs are primarily cytosolic with the exception of the nuclear PABP (PABPN1), which is located in the nucleus. Within the nucleus, PABPN1 is believed to bind to the poly(A) tail of nascent mRNA and along with cleavage and polyadenylation specificity factor (CPSF) define the length of the newly synthesized poly(A) tail. The cellular role of PABP1 has been extensively studied over the years; however, the function of other PABPs remains poorly defined. In order to understand the role of PABPN1 in cellular mRNA metabolism and it's interrelation with other PABPs, we depleted PABPN1 using RNAi in HeLa and HEK293 cells. Our results show that PABPN1 depletion did not have any effect on the poly(A) tail length, nuclear export of mRNA, mRNA translation, and transcription. Rather, PABPN1 depletion resulted in a compensatory response as observed by increased level of PABP5 and nuclear accumulation of PABP4. In addition, PABP4 was associated with the poly(A) tract of pre-mRNA and CPSF in PABPN1 depleted cells. Nevertheless, PABPN1 depletion significantly affected cell survival as evidenced by an increase in apoptosis markers: phosphorylated p53 and PUMA and as judged by the expression of ER stress marker GRP78. Our results suggest that although function of PABPN1 may be compensated by nuclear translocation of PABP4 and perhaps by increase in the cytoplasmic abundance of PABP5, these were not sufficient to prevent apoptosis of cells. Thus PABPN1 may have a novel anti apoptotic role in mammalian cells.

Poly(A)-binding protein 1 (PABP1) has a fundamental role in the regulation of mRNA translation and stability, both of which are crucial for a wide variety of cellular processes. Although generally a diffuse cytoplasmic protein, it can be found in discrete foci such as stress and neuronal granules. Mammals encode several additional cytoplasmic PABPs that remain poorly characterised, and with the exception of PABP4, appear to be restricted in their expression to a small number of cell types. We have found that PABP4, similarly to PABP1, is a diffusely cytoplasmic protein that can be localised to stress granules. However, UV exposure unexpectedly relocalised both proteins to the nucleus. Nuclear relocalisation of PABPs was accompanied by a reduction in protein synthesis but was not linked to apoptosis. In examining the mechanism of PABP relocalisation, we found that it was related to a change in the distribution of poly(A) RNA within cells. Further investigation revealed that this change in RNA distribution was not affected by PABP knockdown but that perturbations that block mRNA export recapitulate PABP relocalisation. Our results support a model in which nuclear export of PABPs is dependent on ongoing mRNA export, and that a block in this process following UV exposure leads to accumulation of cytoplasmic PABPs in the nucleus. These data also provide mechanistic insight into reports that transcriptional inhibitors and expression of certain viral proteins cause relocation of PABP to the nucleus.

The high-risk human papillomavirus (HPV) E6 and E7 oncoproteins are critical to the immortalization of keratinocytes. HPV type 16 (HPV16) E6 interacts with endogenous proteins to activate hTERT, the catalytic subunit of telomerase, thus avoiding cellular senescence signals. NFX1-123, the longer splice variant of NFX1, interacts with HPV16 E6, as well as cytoplasmic poly(A) binding proteins 1 and 4 (PABPC1 and PABPC4). HPV16 E6 affects hTERT expression posttranscriptionally through NFX1-123, as NFX1-123 interacts with hTERT mRNA and stabilizes it, leading to greater telomerase activity. The PAM2 motif of NFX1-123, with which it binds PABPCs, is required for the posttranscriptional regulation of hTERT by HPV16 E6 and NFX1-123. There is increasing evidence that RNA and DNA viruses utilize RNA-processing proteins, and specifically PABPCs, in the normal virus life cycle, and there is also evidence that RNA-processing proteins are perturbed in cancers. Here, we show that PABPCs are critical in hTERT regulation by HPV16 E6. Although the amount and cellular localization of PABPCs were largely unchanged in cervical cancer cell lines with or without HPV16 and in human foreskin keratinocytes (HFKs) with or without HPV16 E6, knockdown of PABPCs decreased hTERT mRNA and telomerase activity and overexpression of PABPC4 increased these in HPV16 E6-expressing HFKs. In contrast, knockdown of PABPCs in C33A cells had no effect on hTERT mRNA or telomerase activity. Additionally, overexpression of PABPC4 and hTERT led to greater growth of cultured HPV16 E6-expressing HFKs. This is the first evidence that PABPCs have a targeted role in hTERT regulation leading to a growth advantage in cells expressing HPV16 E6.

In testis mRNA stability and translation initiation are extensively under the control of poly(A)-binding proteins (PABP). Here we have cloned a new human testis-specific PABP (PABP3) of 631 amino acids (70.1 kDa) with 92.5% identical residues to the ubiquitous PABP1. A northern blot of multiple human tissues hybridised with PABP3- and PABP1-specific oligonucleotide probes revealed two PABP3 mRNAs (2.1 and 2.5 kb) detected only in testis, whereas PABP1 mRNA (3.2 kb) was present in all tested tissues. In human adult testis, PABP3 mRNA expression was restricted to round spermatids, whereas PABP1 was expressed in these cells as well as in pachytene spermatocytes. PABP3-specific antibodies identified a protein of 70 kDa in human testis extracts. This protein binds poly(A) with a slightly lower affinity as compared to PABP1. The human PABP3 gene is intronless with a transcription start site 61 nt upstream from the initiation codon. A sequence of 256 bp upstream from the transcription start site drives the promoter activity of PABP3 and its tissue-specific expression. The expression of PABP3 might be a way to bypass PABP1 translational repression and to produce the amount of PABP needed for active mRNA translation in spermatids.

A recent meta-analysis of genome-wide association (GWA) studies identified 95 loci that influence lipid traits in the adult population and found that collectively these explained about 25-30% of heritability for each trait. Little is known about how these loci affect lipid levels in early life, but there is evidence that genetic effects on HDL- and LDL-cholesterol (HDL-C, LDL-C) and triglycerides vary with age. We studied Australian adults (N = 10,151) and adolescents (N = 2,363) who participated in twin and family studies and for whom we have lipid phenotypes and genotype information for 91 of the 95 genetic variants. Heterogeneity tests between effect sizes in adult and adolescent cohorts showed an excess of heterogeneity for HDL-C (p(Het)<0.05 at 5 out of 37 loci), but no more than expected by chance for LDL-C (1 out of 14 loci), or trigycerides (0 out 24). There were 2 (out of 5) with opposite direction of effect in adolescents compared to adults for HDL-C, but none for LDL-C. The biggest difference in effect size was for LDL-C at rs6511720 near LDLR, adolescents (0.021 ± 0.033 mmol/L) and adults (0.157 ± 0.023 mmol/L), p(Het) = 0.013; followed by ZNF664 (p(Het) = 0.018) and PABPC4 (p(Het) = 0.034) for HDL-C. Our findings suggest that some of the previously identified variants associate differently with lipid traits in adolescents compared to adults, either because of developmental changes or because of greater interactions with environmental differences in adults.

Cytoplasmic poly(A)-binding proteins (PABPs) regulate mRNA stability and translation. Although predominantly localized in the cytoplasm, PABP proteins also cycle through the nucleus. Recent work has established that their steady-state localization can be altered by cellular stresses such as ultraviolet (UV) radiation, and infection by several viruses, resulting in nuclear accumulation of PABPs. Here, we present further evidence that their interaction with and release from mRNA and translation complexes are important in determining their sub-cellular distribution and propose an integrated model for regulated nucleo-cytoplasmic transport of PABPs.

On the past decade a plethora of investigations were directed on identification of molecules involved in breast tumorogenesis, which could represent a powerful tool for monitoring, diagnostics and treatment of this disease. In current study we analyzed six previously identified medullary breast carcinoma autoantigens including LGALS3BP, RAD50, FAM50A, RBPJ, PABPC4, LRRFIP1 with cancer restricted serological profile in different histological types of breast cancer. Semi-quantitative immunohistochemical analysis of 20 tissue samples including medullary breast carcinoma, invasive ductal carcinoma, invasive lobular carcinoma and non-cancerous tissues obtained from patients with fibrocystic disease (each of five) was performed using specifically generated polyclonal antibodies. Differences in expression patterns were evaluated considering percent of positively stained cells, insensitivity of staining and subcellular localization in cells of all tissue samples. All 6 antigens predominantly expressed in the most cells of all histological types of breast tumors and non-cancerous tissues with slight differences in intensity of staining and subcellular localization. The most significant differences in expression pattern were revealed for RAD50 and LGALS3BP in different histological types of breast cancer and for PABPC4 and FAM50A antigens in immune cells infiltrating breast tumors. This pilot study made possible to select 4 antigens LGALS3BP, RAD50, PABPC4, and FAM50A as promising candidates for more comprehensive research as potential molecular markers for breast cancer diagnostics and therapy.
