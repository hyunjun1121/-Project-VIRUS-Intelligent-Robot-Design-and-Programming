IDEAL_ANSWER:
- The B cell adaptor protein with ankyrin repeats (BANK1) and the B lymphoid tyrosine kinase (BLK) have been genetically associated with autoimmunity. The proteins of these genes interact physically and work in concert during B-cell signaling.
- Genetic and physical interaction of the B-cell systemic lupus erythematosus-associated genes BANK1 and BLK.
- BLK interacts with at least two of the three kinases in the B-cell/proteasome pathway, namely the transcription factor BANK1 and the chromatin-associated transcription factor 1 (CACGT1).
- Primary interacting protein of BLK (also known as BANK1)
- Primary interacting protein of BLK is Cdk1-binding protein 1 (Bik1/Nbk1).
- The genes BANK1 and BLK were recently described as associated with SLE a genetic interaction between BANK1 and BLK, and demonstrates that these molecules interact physically.
- BLK activity is regulated by two interacting proteins, BANK1 and BANK2.
- a genetic interaction between BANK1 and BLK, and demonstrates that these molecules interact physically.
- Genetic and physical interaction of the B-cell systemic lupus erythematosus-associated genes BANK1 and BLK. a genetic interaction between BANK1 and BLK, and demonstrates that these molecules interact physically.
- A The genes BANK1 and BLK were recently described as associated with SLE
- Autophagy-related gene 5 (ATG5), ATG7, B-lymphoid tyrosine kinase (BLK) and B-cell scaffold protein with ankyrin repeats 1 (BANK1) are involved in B-cell signaling;
- bank1

EXACT_ANSWER:
- BANK1
