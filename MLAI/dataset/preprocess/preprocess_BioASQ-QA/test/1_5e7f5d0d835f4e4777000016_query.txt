When was Fluzone Intradermal replaced with Fluzone Intradermal Quadrivalent?

[PMID: 27457797]
An intradermal version of Fluzone® split-virion inactivated trivalent influenza vaccine, containing 9 µg hemagglutinin per strain of A/H1N1, A/H3N2, and one B lineage virus (Fluzone Intradermal, Sanofi Pasteur), became available in the US during the 2011-2012 influenza season for adults 18-64 years of age. In advance of the 2015-2016 season, Fluzone Intradermal was replaced with Fluzone Intradermal Quadrivalent vaccine, which contains 9 µg hemagglutinin per strain of the two A-strain viruses and both B-strain lineage viruses (Victoria and Yamagata). This literature review summarizes the history and mechanism of intradermal vaccination, discusses the clinical trial results supporting the immunogenicity and safety of Fluzone Intradermal Quadrivalent vaccine, and describes the unique microinjection system used to deliver Fluzone Intradermal Quadrivalent. Expert commentary: Fluzone Intradermal Quadrivalent may boost confidence in influenza vaccination with the addition of a second B-lineage strain. By using an innovative microinjection system, the vaccine is also designed to address some of the logistic challenges faced by healthcare providers administering immunizations.
