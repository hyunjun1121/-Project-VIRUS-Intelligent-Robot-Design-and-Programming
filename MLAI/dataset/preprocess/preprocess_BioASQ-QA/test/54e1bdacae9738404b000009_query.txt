What is generic name of drug Adempas?

Riociguat (Adempas(®)), an oral first-in-class soluble guanylate cyclase (sGC) stimulator, is under global development by Bayer Healthcare Pharmaceuticals Inc. for the treatment of adult patients with inoperable or chronic/persistent chronic thromboembolic pulmonary hypertension (CTEPH) and for the treatment of adult patients with pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH). The drug directly stimulates sGC in a nitric oxide independent manner, thereby increasing the sensitivity of sGC to nitric oxide, leading to increased cyclic guanosine monophosphate generation (a key signalling molecule involved in regulating vascular tone, proliferation, fibrosis and inflammation). Riociguat is the world's first approved pharmacotherapy for CTEPH, with its first global approval in this indication occurring in Canada. It has subsequently been approved in the USA for the treatment of patients with CTEPH and also received its first global approval in patients with PAH in the USA. It is undergoing regulatory review for these indications in Europe and for use in patients with CTEPH in Japan. This article summarizes the milestones in the development of riociguat, leading to its first global approvals in patients with CTEPH and PAH.

Riociguat (Adempas): a novel agent for the treatment of pulmonary arterial hypertension and chronic thromboembolic pulmonary hypertension.

[PMID: 24524094]
Pulmonary hypertension (PH) is a progressive disease that is accompanied by a poor prognosis. Pulmonary vasoconstriction is facilitated through multiple pathways and results in increased pulmonary vascular pressure leading to cell proliferation, vascular remodeling, right ventricular hypertrophy/failure, and ultimately death. Until recently, just six medications were approved -all for one subclass of PH. On October 8, 2013, riociguat (Adempas®) became the first medication approved for multiple etiologies of PH. Preclinical studies have demonstrated safety and efficacy with significant clinical trials supporting its advancement into phase IV trials. Although long-term safety and efficacy and place in therapy remain to be established, riociguat presents as an exciting new option for the treatment of PH and potentially has additional indications in the near future.

Riociguat (Adempas(®)), a soluble guanylate cyclase stimulator, is a new, first-in-class drug approved for the treatment of patients with chronic thromboembolic pulmonary hypertension (CTEPH) [inoperable or persistent/recurrent following surgery] or pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH). It has been designated an orphan medicine by the European Medicines Agency and the US FDA. This article reviews the available pharmacological properties of oral riociguat and its clinical efficacy and tolerability in adults with CTEPH or PAH. Riociguat is effective and well tolerated in patients with inoperable CTEPH or persistent/recurrent CTEPH following pulmonary endarterectomy, and in patients with PAH. It has a positive result on exercise capacity and pulmonary haemodynamics, and improves WHO functional class. Most adverse events can be attributed to the vasodilatory mechanism of riociguat; however, there is a potential for serious bleeding and fetal harm, and riociguat use is contraindicated in pregnant patients. Pulmonary endarterectomy remains the first treatment of choice for CTEPH, as it is potentially curative. Head-to-head trials comparing riociguat with the approved phosphodiesterase type 5 inhibitors in patients with PAH would be of value for the placement of riociguat in the management of this disease. Riociguat is a promising addition to the treatment options for patients with CTEPH or PAH.
