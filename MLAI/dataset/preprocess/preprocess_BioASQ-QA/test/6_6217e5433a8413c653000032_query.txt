The neurotransmitter serotonin (5-HT) affects valvular degeneration and dogs with myxomatous mitral valve disease (MMVD) exhibit alterations in 5-HT signaling. In Maltese dogs, 3 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in the 5-HT transporter (SERT) gene are suggested to associate with MMVD. Determine the association of SERT polymorphisms on MMVD severity and serum 5-HT concentration in Cavalier King Charles Spaniels (CKCS). Additionally, investigate the association between selected clinical and hematologic variables and serum 5-HT and assess the correlation between HPLC and ELISA measurements of serum 5-HT. Seventy-one CKCS (42 females and 29 males; 7.8 [4.7;9.9] years (median [Q1;Q3])) in different MMVD stages. This prospective study used TaqMan genotyping assays to assess SERT gene polymorphisms. Neurotransmitter concentrations were assessed by HPLC and ELISA. TaqMan analyses identified none of the selected SERT polymorphisms in any of the CKCS examined. Serum 5-HT was associated with platelet count (P < .001) but not MMVD severity, age or medical therapy and did not correlate with serum concentration of the 5-HT metabolite, 5-hydroxyindoleacetic acid. The ELISA serum 5-HT correlated with HPLC measurements (ρ = .87; P < .0001) but was lower (mean difference = -22 ng/mL; P = .02) independent of serum 5-HT concentration (P = .2). Selected SERT SNPs associated with MMVD in Maltese dogs were not found in CKCS and only platelet count influenced serum 5-HT concentration. These SNPs are unlikely to be associated with MMVD pathophysiology or serum 5-HT concentration in CKCS. HPLC and ELISA serum 5-HT demonstrated good correlation but ELISA systematically underestimated 5-HT.

MDMA or Ecstasy has made a resurgence in popularity and the majority of users consist of teenagers and adolescents. Therefore, it is important to determine whether MDMA causes long-term damage and what this damage entails. There is an ongoing debate about possible neurocognitive changes in 3,4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA) users related to MDMA's neurotoxic potential. Multiple neuroimaging studies have shown that Ecstasy use leads to lower serotonin transporter (SERT) availability in multiple brain regions. This may express itself in a loss of cognitive functions like memory, attention and executive function. However, there is increasing evidence reporting that MDMA's induced serotonergic adaptations are reversible over time. The question we thus address is whether the recovery of SERT function predicts a recovery of cognitive function. This review aims to investigate MDMA's long-term effects on SERT availability and cognitive functioning. A literature search was performed in PubMed. Studies that investigated the effects of MDMA on both SERT availability and cognitive performance were eligible for inclusion. SERT availability positively correlated with time of abstinence, whereas memory performance did not show this correlation, but remained impaired in MDMA users. No significant correlation between SERT availability and memory function was found (r = 0.232, p = 0.581; r = 0.176, p = 0.677). The main findings of this review are that MDMA-use leads to an acute decrease in SERT availability and causes an impairment in cognitive functions, mostly memory. However, SERT availability recovers with sustained abstinence while memory function does not. This suggests that SERT availability is not a biomarker for MDMA-induced cognitive impairment and likely also not for MDMA-induced neurotoxicity.

Dynorphin (DYN) is an endogenous neurosecretory peptide which exerts its activity by binding to the family of G protein-coupled receptors, namely the kappa opioid receptor (KOR). Opioids are associated with pain, analgesia, and drug abuse, which play a central role in mood disorders with monoamine neurotransmitter interactions. Growing evidence demonstrates the cellular signaling cascades linked to KOR-mediated monoamine transporters regulation in cell models and native brain tissues. This chapter will review DYN/KOR role in mood and addiction in relevance to dopaminergic and serotonergic neurotransmissions. Also, we discuss the recent findings on KOR-mediated differential regulation of serotonin and dopamine transporters (SERT and DAT). These findings led to a better understanding of the role of DYN/KOR system in aminergic neurotransmission via its modulatory effect on both amine release and clearance. Detailed knowledge of these processes at the molecular level enables designing novel pharmacological reagents to target transporter motifs to treat mood and addiction and reduce unwanted side effects such as aversion, dysphoria, sedation, and psychomimesis.

The monoamine hypothesis of depression attributes the symptoms of major depressive disorders to imbalances of serotonin, noradrenaline, and dopamine in the limbic areas of the brain. The preferential targeting of serotonin receptor (SERT) by selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) has offered an opportunity to reduce the range of these side effects and improve patient adherence to pharmacotherapy. Clozapine remains an effective drug against treatment-resistant schizophrenia, defined as failing treatment with at least two different antipsychotic medications. Patients with schizophrenia who display a constellation of negative symptoms respond poorly to antipsychotic monotherapy. Negative symptoms include the diminution of motivation, interest, or expression. Conversely to the depressive symptomology of interest presently, supplementation of antipsychotics with SSRIs in schizophrenic patients with negative symptoms lead to synergistic improvements in the function of these patients. Fluvoxamine is one of the most potent inhibitors of CYP1A2 and can lead to an increase in clozapine levels. Similar increases in serum clozapine were detected in two patients taking sertraline. However, studies have been contradictory as well, showing no such increases, which are worrying. Clinicians should be aware that clozapine levels should be monitored with any coadministration with SSRIs.

Serotonin and dopamine are putatively involved in the etiology and treatment of anxiety disorders, but positron emission tomography (PET) studies probing the two neurotransmitters in the same individuals are lacking. The aim of this multitracer PET study was to evaluate the regional expression and co-expression of the transporter proteins for serotonin (SERT) and dopamine (DAT) in patients with social anxiety disorder (SAD). Voxel-wise binding potentials (BP<sub>ND</sub>) for SERT and DAT were determined in 27 patients with SAD and 43 age- and sex-matched healthy controls, using the radioligands [<sup>11</sup>C]DASB (3-amino-4-(2-dimethylaminomethylphenylsulfanyl)-benzonitrile) and [<sup>11</sup>C]PE2I (N-(3-iodopro-2E-enyl)-2beta-carbomethoxy-3beta-(4'-methylphenyl)nortropane). Results showed that, within transmitter systems, SAD patients exhibited higher SERT binding in the nucleus accumbens while DAT availability in the amygdala, hippocampus, and putamen correlated positively with symptom severity. At a more lenient statistical threshold, SERT and DAT BP<sub>ND</sub> were also higher in other striatal and limbic regions in patients, and correlated with symptom severity, whereas no brain region showed higher binding in healthy controls. Moreover, SERT/DAT co-expression was significantly higher in SAD patients in the amygdala, nucleus accumbens, caudate, putamen, and posterior ventral thalamus, while lower co-expression was noted in the dorsomedial thalamus. Follow-up logistic regression analysis confirmed that SAD diagnosis was significantly predicted by the statistical interaction between SERT and DAT availability, in the amygdala, putamen, and dorsomedial thalamus. Thus, SAD was associated with mainly increased expression and co-expression of the transporters for serotonin and dopamine in fear and reward-related brain regions. Resultant monoamine dysregulation may underlie SAD symptomatology and constitute a target for treatment.

To explore mechanism of intestinal flora dysregulation promoting constipation, 60 specific pathogen-free (SPF) mice were used as research objects and were treated with constipation population fecal fluid gavage and distilled water gavage. Then, relationship between intestinal dysregulation and constipation in mice with biofilm-mediated intestinal flora was investigated in vitro. The results showed that recombinant serotonin transporter (SERT) messenger ribonucleic acid (mRNA) level of the constipation population fecal fluid gavage group and the relative expression level of SERT mRNA were 1.61 ± 0.08 and 1.49 ± 0.06, which were higher markedly than those of distilled water group (<i>P</i> < 0.05). The level of 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT) in colonic tissue of the constipation population fecal fluid gavage group was 145.36 ± 14.12 ng/mL, and the expression level of 5-HT on the surface of epithelial cells of biofilm-positive colonic tissue was 20.11 ± 2.03, which were significantly lower than those of the distilled water group, with statistical significance (<i>P</i> < 0.05). Besides, the microbial sequencing of fecal flora indicated that The Akk and bacteroidetes ofconstipation population fecal fluid gavage group were higher hugely than those of distilled water group (<i>P</i> < 0.05).In conclusion, after the occurrence of constipation, the diversity of intestinal microflora decreased, and the probiotics reduced. Iintestinal microflora dysregulation would lead to increase of SERT expression level in defecation function and intestinal motility in mice, and the decrease of 5-HT, thereby changing the intestinal movement resulting in mucosal protective barrier damage,thereby causing changes in intestinal movement and the destruction of the intestinal mucosal protective barrier, which eventually resulted in constipation. The occurrence of constipation could be improved by regulating balance of intestinal flora, increasing the diversity of flora, and reducing the genus of opportunistic pathogens.
