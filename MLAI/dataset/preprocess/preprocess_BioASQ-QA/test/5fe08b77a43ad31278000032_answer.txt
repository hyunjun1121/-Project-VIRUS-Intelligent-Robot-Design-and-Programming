IDEAL_ANSWER:
- Saethre-Chotzen syndrome is a craniosynostosis syndrome that is rarely diagnosed prenatally . It is caused by cytogenetic deletions or mutations of the TWIST1 gene . Of the 37 patients with classic features of the syndrome, the overall detection rate for TWIST mutations was 68% . Increased risk for developmental delay is associated with TWIST deletions .
- Saethre-Chotzen syndrome is an autosomalomal, dominantly inherited craniosynostosis caused by mutations in the basic helix-loop-helix transcription factor gene TWIST1 . The majority of patients have mutations in TWIST gene, which codes for a basic helx-loix-loge transcription factor .
- Saethre-Chotzen syndrome (SCS), one of the most common forms of syndromic craniosynostosis (premature fusion of the cranial sutures), results from haploinsufficiency of TWIST1, caused by deletions of the entire gene or loss-of-function variants within the coding region.
- We have evaluated TWIST, a basic helix-loop-helix transcription factor, as a candidate gene for this condition because its expression pattern and mutant phenotypes in Drosophila and mouse are consistent with the Saethre-Chotzen phenotype. Mutations of the TWIST gene in the Saethre-Chotzen syndrome.
- It is caused by cytogenetic deletions or mutations of the TWIST1 gene. We have evaluated TWIST, a basic helix-loop-helix transcription factor, as a candidate gene for this condition because its expression pattern and mutant phenotypes in Drosophila and mouse are consistent with the Saethre-Chotzen phenotype.
- Autosomal dominant mutations in the gene encoding the basic helix-loop-helix transcription factor Twist1 are associated with limb and craniofacial defects in humans with Saethre-Chotzen syndrome.

- Saethre-Chotzen syndrome is an autosomal, dominantly inherited craniosynostosis caused by mutations in the basic helix-loop-helix transcription factor gene TWIST1 . The majority of patients have mutations in TWIST gene on chromosome 7p21 . The most common cause of the syndrome is loss-of-function mutations in a genetic mutation in the TWIST 1 gene . The patient is a heterozygous carrier of the pathogenic variant c.415C>A .
- Saethre-Chotzen syndrome (SCS) is a multiple congenital anomaly-mental retardation complex caused by mutations in the TWIST1 gene (transcription factor Xa, also known as T-box-binding protein 1).
- The Saethre-Chotzen syndrome is an autosomal, dominantly inherited craniosynostosis caused by mutations in the basic helix-loop-helix transcription factor gene TWIST1 . The majority of patients with the syndrome have mutations in TWIST gene . In 55 patients with features of the syndrome, 11% detected to have deletions by real-time gene dosage analysis .
- Mutations in the TWIST1 gene, encoding the syntaxin binding protein 1, have been described as the cause of the Saethre-Chotzen syndrome.
- Saethre-Chotzen syndrome (SCS) is a multiple congenital anomaly-mental retardation complex caused by mutations in the TWIST1 gene.
