What histone modification is recognized by the bromodomain?

[PMID: 15014446]
The coordination of chromatin remodeling with chromatin modification is a central topic in gene regulation. The yeast chromatin remodeling complex RSC bears multiple bromodomains, motifs for acetyl-lysine and histone tail interaction. Here, we identify and characterize Rsc4 and show that it bears tandem essential bromodomains. Conditional rsc4 bromodomain mutations were isolated, and were lethal in combination with gcn5Delta, whereas combinations with esa1 grew well. Replacements involving Lys14 of histone H3 (the main target of Gcn5), but not other H3 or H4 lysine residues, also conferred severe growth defects to rsc4 mutant strains. Importantly, wild-type Rsc4 bound an H3 tail peptide acetylated at Lys14, whereas a bromodomain mutant derivative did not. Loss of particular histone deacetylases suppressed rsc4 bromodomain mutations, suggesting that Rsc4 promotes gene activation. Furthermore, rsc4 mutants displayed defects in the activation of genes involved in nicotinic acid biosynthesis, cell wall integrity, and other pathways. Taken together, Rsc4 bears essential tandem bromodomains that rely on H3 Lys14 acetylation to assist RSC complex for gene activation.

Little is known about how combinations of histone marks are interpreted at the level of nucleosomes. The second PHD finger of human BPTF is known to specifically recognize histone H3 when methylated on lysine 4 (H3K4me2/3). Here, we examine how additional heterotypic modifications influence BPTF binding. Using peptide surrogates, three acetyllysine ligands are indentified for a PHD-adjacent bromodomain in BPTF via systematic screening and biophysical characterization. Although the bromodomain displays limited discrimination among the three possible acetyllysines at the peptide level, marked selectivity is observed for only one of these sites, H4K16ac, in combination with H3K4me3 at the mononucleosome level. In support, these two histone marks constitute a unique trans-histone modification pattern that unambiguously resides within a single nucleosomal unit in human cells, and this module colocalizes with these marks in the genome. Together, our data call attention to nucleosomal patterning of covalent marks in dictating critical chromatin associations.

Bromodomains are present in many chromatin-associated proteins such as the SWI/SNF and RSC chromatin remodelling and the SAGA HAT (histone acetyltransferase) complexes, and can bind to acetylated lysine residues in the N-terminal tails of the histones. Lysine acetylation is a histone modification that forms a stable epigenetic mark on chromatin for bromodomain-containing proteins to dock and in turn regulate gene expression. In order to better understand how bromodomains read the 'histone code' and interact with acetylated histones, we have tested the interactions of several bromodomains within transcriptional co-activators with differentially acetylated histone tail peptides and HAT-acetylated histones. Using GST (glutathione S-transferase) pull-down assays, we show specificity of binding of some bromodomains to differentially acetylated H3 and H4 peptides as well as HAT-acetylated histones. Our results reveal that the Swi2/Snf2 bromodomain interacts with various acetylated H3 and H4 peptides, whereas the Gcn5 bromodomain interacts only with acetylated H3 peptides and tetra-acetylated H4 peptides. Additionally we show that the Spt7 bromodomain interacts with acetylated H3 peptides weakly, but not with acetylated H4 peptides. Some bromodomains such as the Bdf1-2 do not interact with most of the acetylated peptides tested. Results of the peptide experiments are confirmed with tests of interactions between these bromodomains and HAT-acetylated histones. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the Swi2/Snf2 bromodomain is important for the binding and the remodelling activity of the SWI/SNF complex on hyperacetylated nucleosomes. The selective recognition of the bromodomains observed in the present study accounts for the broad effects of bromodomain-containing proteins observed on binding to histones.

Double bromodomain proteins bind to acetylated lysines in histones, bringing associated histone modification and nucleosome remodeling activity to chromatin. The ability of bromodomain regulators to alter chromatin status and control gene expression has long been appreciated to be important in the development of certain human cancers. However, bromodomain proteins have now been found also to be critical, non-redundant players in diverse, non-malignant phenotypes, directing transcriptional programs that control adipogenesis, energy metabolism and inflammation. The fact that such different processes are functionally linked by the same molecular machinery suggests a common epigenetic basis to understand and interpret the origins of several important co-morbidities, such as asthma or cancer that occurs in obesity, and complex inflammatory diseases like cardiovascular disease, systemic lupus erythematosus, rheumatoid arthritis and insulin resistance that may be built on a common pro-inflammatory foundation.

The access of transcription factors to eukaryotic promoters often requires modification of their chromatin structure, which is accomplished by the action of two general classes of multiprotein complexes. One class contains histone acetyltransferases (HATs), such as Gcn5 in the SAGA complex, which acetylate nucleosomal histones. The second class contains ATPases, such as Swi2 in the Swi/Snf complex, which provide the energy for nucleosome remodelling. In several promoters these two complexes cooperate but their functional linkage is unknown. A protein module that is present in all nuclear HATs, the bromodomain, could provide such a link. The recently reported in vitro binding of a HAT bromodomain with acetylated lysines within H3 and H4 amino-terminal peptides indicates that this interaction may constitute a targeting step for events that follow histone acetylation. Here we use a suitable promoter to show that bromodomain residues essential for acetyl-lysine binding are not required in vivo for Gcn5-mediated histone acetylation but are fundamental for the subsequent Swi2-dependent nucleosome remodelling and consequent transcriptional activation. We show that the Gcn5 bromodomain stabilizes the Swi/Snf complex on this promoter.

The posttranslational modification of chromatin through acetylation at selected histone lysine residues is governed by histone acetyltransferases (HATs) and histone deacetylases (HDACs). The significance of this subset of the epigenetic code is interrogated and interpreted by an acetyllysine-specific protein-protein interaction with bromodomain reader modules. Selective inhibition of the bromo and extra C-terminal domain (BET) family of bromodomains with a small molecule is feasible, and this may represent an opportunity for disease intervention through the recently disclosed antiproliferative and anti-inflammatory properties of such inhibitors. Herein, we describe the discovery and structure-activity relationship (SAR) of a novel, small-molecule chemical probe for BET family inhibition that was identified through the application of structure-based fragment assessment and optimization techniques. This has yielded a potent, selective compound with cell-based activity (PFI-1) that may further add to the understanding of BET family function within the bromodomains.

Lysine acetylation has been shown to occur in many protein targets, including core histones, about 40 transcription factors and over 30 other proteins. This modification is reversible in vivo, with its specificity and level being largely controlled by signal-dependent association of substrates with acetyltransferases and deacetylases. Like other covalent modifications, lysine acetylation exerts its effects through "loss-of-function" and "gain-of-function" mechanisms. Among the latter, lysine acetylation generates specific docking sites for bromodomain proteins. For example, bromodomains of Gcn5, PCAF, TAF1 and CBP are able to recognize acetyllysine residues in histones, HIV Tat, p53, c-Myb or MyoD. In addition to the acetyllysine moiety, the flanking sequences also contribute to efficient recognition. The relationship between acetyllysine and bromodomains is reminiscent of the specific recognition of phosphorylated residues by phospho-specific binding modules such as SH2 domains and 14-3-3 proteins. Therefore, lysine acetylation forges a novel signaling partnership with bromodomains to govern the temporal and spatial regulation of protein functions in vivo.

Bromodomain factor 1 (Bdf1) associates with Saccharomyces cerevisiae TFIID and corresponds to the C-terminal half of higher eukaryotic TAF1. It also associates with the SWR-C complex, which is important for Htz1 deposition. Bdf1 binds preferentially to acetylated histone H4. Bdf1 is phosphorylated, but the mechanism and significance of this modification have been unclear. Two distinct regions within Bdf1 are phosphorylated; one is just C terminal to the bromodomains and the other is near the C terminus. Mutational analysis shows that phosphorylation is necessary for Bdf1 function in vivo. Endogenous protein kinase CK2 purifies with Bdf1 and phosphorylates both domains. A similar mechanism may be responsible for phosphorylation of the C-terminal region of mammalian TAF1. These findings suggest that CK2 phosphorylation of Bdf1 may regulate RNA polymerase II transcription and/or chromatin structure.

Histone-lysine acetylation is a vital chromatin post-translational modification involved in the epigenetic regulation of gene transcription. Bromodomains bind acetylated lysines, acting as readers of the histone-acetylation code. Competitive inhibitors of this interaction have antiproliferative and anti-inflammatory properties. With 57 distinct bromodomains known, the discovery of subtype-selective inhibitors of the histone-bromodomain interaction is of great importance. We have identified the 3,5-dimethylisoxazole moiety as a novel acetyl-lysine bioisostere, which displaces acetylated histone-mimicking peptides from bromodomains. Using X-ray crystallographic analysis, we have determined the interactions responsible for the activity and selectivity of 4-substituted 3,5-dimethylisoxazoles against a selection of phylogenetically diverse bromodomains. By exploiting these interactions, we have developed compound 4d, which has IC(50) values of <5 μM for the bromodomain-containing proteins BRD2(1) and BRD4(1). These compounds are promising leads for the further development of selective probes for the bromodomain and extra C-terminal domain (BET) family and CREBBP bromodomains.

Methylation of histone lysine residues in eukaryotic chromatin has been an exciting area of research ever since the first histone methyltransferase enzyme, Suv39h, was found to methylate lysine 9 of histone H3 in 2000. Only a year later, the HP1 chromodomain polypeptide was identified as a recognition module for this histone modification. Similar to bromodomain-containing proteins that recognize histone acetylation sites and subsequently stabilize large complexes to chromatin, effector proteins can also be recruited and stabilized by histone methylation. Although histone acetylation generally correlates with active transcription, histone methylation is associated with both the activation and silencing of transcription, depending on which lysine residue is modified. The list of proteins that may in fact directly associate with specific methylated histone lysines is expanding. Since the finding of HP1, many additional proteins have been shown to bind methylated histone residues. For instance, Polycomb, Chd1, 53BP1, and Crb2/Rad9 proteins all associate with methylated chromatin in a unique manner governed by their respective recognition motifs. Here we highlight recent data on the recognition specificity and biological significance of proteins that associate with methylated histone lysines.

Studies showed that the bromodomain binds to acetyl-lysines on histone tails, which is involved in deciphering the histone codes. BRD7, a novel bromodomain gene, is the first described bromodomain gene involved in nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC). Previous studies showed that ectopic expression of BRD7 inhibited cell growth and cell cycle progression from G1 to S phase in HNE1 cells (a NPC cell line) by transcriptionally regulating some cell cycle related genes including E2F3 gene. In the present study, we revealed the co-localization between acetylated H3 and BRD7 and found that the bromodomain of BRD7 is required for this co-localization. More importantly, wild-type BRD7 interacted with H3 peptide acetylated at Lys14, while the bromodomain deleted mutant lost this ability. We also found that the mutant BRD7 failed to regulate E2F3 promoter activity and inhibit cell cycle progression. These results indicated that the transcriptional regulation role of BRD7 was achieved by binding to acetylated histone H3 and that the bromodomain was essential for this role. In addition, no obvious changes were observed in the acetylated level of histone H3 after transfection with BRD7, indicating that chromatin remodeling, not chromatin modification, is the major mechanism of BRD7 mediated gene transcription. Taken together, the present work shed light on the fact that a novel bromodomain gene, BRD7, is of importance in transcriptional regulation and cellular events including cell cycle.

The CREB binding protein (CBP) is a human transcriptional coactivator consisting of several conserved functional modules, which interacts with distinct transcription factors including nuclear receptors, CREB, and STAT proteins. Despite the importance of CBP in transcriptional regulation, many questions regarding the role of its particular domains in CBP functions remain unanswered. Therefore, developing small molecules capable of selectively modulating a single domain of CBP is of invaluable aid at unraveling its prominent activities. Here we report the design, synthesis, and biological evaluation of conformationally restricted peptides as novel modulators for the acetyl-lysine binding bromodomain (BRD) of CBP. Utilizing a target structure-guided and computer-aided rational design approach, we developed a series of cyclic peptides with affinity for CBP BRD significantly greater than those of its biological ligands, including lysine-acetylated histones and tumor suppressor p53. The best cyclopeptide of the series exhibited a K(d) of 8.0 μM, representing a 24-fold improvement in affinity over that of the linear lysine 382-acetylated p53 peptide. This lead peptide is highly selective for CBP BRD over BRDs from other transcriptional proteins. Cell-based functional assays carried out in colorectal carcinoma HCT116 cells further demonstrated the efficacy of this compound to modulate p53 stability and function in response to DNA damage. Our results strongly argue that these CBP modulators can effectively inhibit p53 transcriptional activity by blocking p53K382ac binding to CBP BRD and promoting p53 instability by changes of its post-translational modification states, a different mechanism than that of the p53 inhibitors reported to date.

The fact that histones are modified by acetylation has been known for almost 30 years. The recent identification of enzymes that regulate histone acetylation has revealed a broader use of this modification than was suspected previously. Acetylases are now known to modify a variety of proteins, including transcription factors, nuclear import factors and alpha-tubulin. Acetylation regulates many diverse functions, including DNA recognition, protein-protein interaction and protein stability. There is even a conserved structure, the bromodomain, that recognizes acetylated residues and may serve as a signalling domain. If you think all this sounds familiar, it should be. These are features characteristic of kinases. So, is acetylation a modification analogous to phosphorylation? This review sets out what we know about the broader substrate specificity and regulation of acetyl- ases and goes on to compare acetylation with the process of phosphorylation.
