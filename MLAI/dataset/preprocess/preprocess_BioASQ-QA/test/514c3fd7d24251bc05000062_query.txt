The analysis of intact protein assemblies in native-like states by mass spectrometry offers a wealth of information on their biochemical and biophysical properties. Here we show that the Orbitrap mass analyzer can be used to measure protein assemblies of molecular weights approaching one megadalton with sensitivity down to the detection of single ions. Minor instrumental modifications enabled the measurement of various protein assemblies with outstanding mass-spectral resolution.

Previous studies have shown that pulmonary surfactant protein D (SP-D) is composed of a 43-kDa polypeptide with a short NH2-terminal domain, a collagen sequence, and a COOH-terminal C-type lectin domain. In the present studies, ultrastructural and biochemical techniques were used to examine the quaternary structure of native rat SP-D (rSP-D). Electron microscopy of freeze-dried preparations demonstrated a highly homogeneous population of molecules with four identical rod-like arms (46 nm in length), each with an 8-9-nm diameter globular terminal expansion. The arms, which are similar in diameter to the type I collagen helix (approximately 4 nm), emanate from the central "hub" in two pairs that closely parallel each other for their first 10 nm. This structure is consistent with hydrodynamic studies that predict an highly asymmetric and extended molecule (f/f0 = 3.26) with a large Stokes radius (Rs = 18 nm). Pepsin digestion gave glycosylated, trimeric collagenous fragments (43 +/- 4 nm, 17 kDa/chain). Trimeric subunits containing intact triple helical domains were also liberated from SP-D dodecamers by sulfhydryl reduction under non-denaturing conditions. Digestion of rSP-D with bacterial collagenase generated a COOH-terminal carbohydrate binding fragment and a smaller peptide (approximately 12 kDa, unreduced) that contains interchain disulfide bonds. Electron microscopy also demonstrated higher orders of multimerization, with as many as 8 molecules associated at the hub. These studies demonstrate that SP-D is assembled as homopolymers of four identical trimeric subunits, that interactions between the amino-terminal domains of the trimers are stabilized by interchain disulfide bonds, and that SP-D molecules can associate to form complex multimolecular assemblies.

In recent years mass spectrometry based techniques have emerged as structural biology tools for the characterization of macromolecular, noncovalent assemblies. Many of these efforts involve preservation of intact protein complexes within the mass spectrometer, providing molecular weight measurements that allow the determination of subunit stoichiometry and real-time monitoring of protein interactions. Attempts have been made to further elucidate subunit architecture through the dissociation of subunits from the intact complex by colliding it into inert gas atoms such as argon or xenon. Unfortunately, the amount of structural information that can be derived from such strategies is limited by the nearly ubiquitous ejection of a single, unfolded subunit. Here, we present results from the gas-phase dissociation of protein-protein complexes upon collision into a surface. Dissociation of a series of tetrameric and pentameric proteins demonstrate that alternative subunit fragments, not observed through multiple collisions with gas atoms, can be generated through surface collision. Evidence is presented for the retention of individual subunit structure, and in some cases, retention of noncovalent interactions between subunits and ligands. We attribute these differences to the rapid large energy input of ion-surface collisions, which leads to the dissociation of subunits prior to the unfolding of individual monomers.

It is established that noncovalent complexes can be maintained both during and after electrospray and that assemblies of increasing size and complexity often lead to broadened peaks in mass spectra. This broadening arises from the tendency of large protein assemblies to form adducts with salts and is compounded when complexes are isolated directly from cells, without the full protein complement. To investigate the origins of this broadening in mass spectral peaks and to develop the optimal method for analyzing mass spectra of large protein complexes, we have carried out a systematic investigation of a series of noncovalent complexes representing a range of different sizes and architectures. We establish a positive correlation between peak width and the increased mass observed and show that this correlation is independent of the instrumental parameters employed. Using this relationship we show that we can determine masses of both 30S subunits and intact 2.3 MDa 70S ribosomes from Thermus thermophilus. The masses of both particles are consistent with multiple populations of ribosomes. To identify these various populations we combine simulated mass spectra of ribosomes, with and without the full protein complement, and estimate the extent of adducts from our study of known complexes. The results allow us to determine the contribution of the different subpopulations to the overall mass spectrum. We confirm the existence of these subpopulations using tandem mass spectrometry of intact 30S subunits. Overall, the results show that, rather than uniform particles, gas-phase ribosomes consist of a number of discrete populations. More generally, the results establish a rigorous procedure for accurate mass measurement and spectral analysis of heterogeneous macromolecular assemblies.
