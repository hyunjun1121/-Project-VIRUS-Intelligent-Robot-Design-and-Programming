What is the definitive treatment for low pressure headache?

[PMID: 19665883]
Women presenting with low pressure post-partum headache following neuraxial techniques are frequently offered an epidural blood patch, despite its inherent risks. We present two parturients with classical symptoms of low-pressure headache, who each received neuraxial labour analgesia without a documented dural puncture with a Tuohy needle. Both parturients were successfully managed using acupuncture rather than an epidural blood patch.

Postdural puncture headache (PDPH) has been a problem for patients, following dural puncture, since August Bier reported the first case in 1898. His paper discussed the pathophysiology of low-pressure headache resulting from leakage of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) from the subarachnoid to the epidural space. Clinical and laboratory research over the last 30 years has shown that use of small-gauge needles, particularly of the pencil-point design, is associated with a lower risk of PDPH than traditional cutting point needle tips (Quincke-point needle). A careful history can rule out other causes of headache. A postural component of headache is the sine qua non of PDPH. In high-risk patients , for example, age < 50 years, postpartum, large-gauge needle puncture, epidural blood patch should be performed within 24-48 h of dural puncture. The optimum volume of blood has been shown to be 12-20 mL for adult patients. Complications of AEBP are rare.

Low pressure headache typically occurs as a complication of dural puncture. "Spontaneous" low pressure headache is a relatively rare but under-recognised cause of intractable headache. Clinical suspicion of this condition warrants imaging of the brain to confirm the diagnosis; spinal imaging may be needed to identify the site of the leak. Epidural blood patching may be necessary to seal the leak - CT fluoroscopy may be helpful in delivering the patch directly to the site of the leak. Surgical intervention may be required in intractable cases. We describe a patient with spontaneous intracranial hypotension and review the clinical and radiological features of this syndrome.

Once believed an exceedingly rare disorder, recent evidence suggests that low cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) pressure headache has to be considered an important cause of new daily persistent headaches, particularly among young and middle-aged individuals. Treatment of low CSF pressure headache consists of non-invasive/conservative measures and invasive measures with epidural blood patch providing the cornerstone of the invasive measures. In the present pilot study we therefore aimed to evaluate the treatment efficacy of epidural blood patch (EBP) in treatment-refractory low-pressure headache. Our primary effect parameter was total headache burden defined as area under the curve (AUC: intensity × duration) and as secondary effect parameters we identified: intensity (VAS 0-10), frequency (days per month), duration in hours (total hours/month) and also medication days (days on medication/month). In our primary effect parameter we found a significant reduction in AUC with more than 25% and this is considered to be clinically relevant. We found also a significant and relevant reduction at -22% in intensity. A trend towards reduction in duration was seen. We found no statistically significant reduction in frequency. An increase in days with use of medication was found. Increased awareness of low CSF pressure headache is emphasized and a controlled larger randomized study is needed to confirm the results. However the present results, allows us to conclude that EBP in treatment-refractory low CSF pressure headache can be considered as a treatment option.

Headaches complicating lumboperitoneal (LP) shunt placement have been attributed to shunt failure with resultant high intracranial pressure or to overdrainage with resultant low intracranial pressure. In this case, a 17-yr-old girl had symptoms of a low-pressure headache after LP shunt placement alleviated by an epidural blood patch. The success of this therapy suggests postdural puncture as a possible cause for low-pressure headache after LP shunt placement. Epidural blood patch may be an alternative initial therapy for some low-pressure headaches after LP shunt placement.

This Evidence-Based Case Management article evaluates and grades the evidence for two anesthesiology-related interventions: prophylaxis after unintentional meningeal puncture and treatment of spontaneous intracranial hypotension (SIH). A search was made of relevant English language clinical studies or reports pertinent to the topic of low-pressure headache, but excluding the treatment of meningeal puncture headache. Thirty-seven case reports, case series, and clinical trials were included to develop the best available evidence-based recommendations for the prophylaxis of unintentional meningeal puncture and for the treatment of SIH. The highest quality randomized controlled trials suggest that prophylactic epidural blood patch (EBP) does not reduce the incidence of headache after unintentional meningeal puncture. The weight of existing literature supports EBP as an initial treatment of SIH, although its effectiveness does not approach that seen when EBP is used to treat meningeal puncture headache.

We describe thickening and contrast enhancement of the intracranial pachymeninges, revealed by MRI in a patient with presumed low-pressure headache following dural puncture and a blood patch. The clinical and radiological abnormalities resolved within 2 weeks.

Post-dural puncture headache (PDPHA) has been a vexing problem for patients undergoing dural puncture for spinal anaesthesia, as a complication of epidural anaesthesia, and after diagnostic lumbar puncture since Bier reported the first case in 1898. This Chapter discusses the pathophysiology of low-pressure headache resulting from leakage of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) from the subarachnoid to the epidural spaces. Clinical and laboratory research over the last 30 years has shown that use of small-gauge needles, particularly of the pencil-point design, is associated with a lower risk of PDPHA than traditional cutting point needle tips (Quincke-point needles). A careful history can rule out other causes of headache. A positional component of headache is the sine qua non of PDPHA. In high-risk patients (e.g. age < 50 years, post-partum, large-gauge-needle puncture), patients should be offered early (within 24-48 h of dural puncture) epidural blood patch. The optimum volume of blood has been shown to be 12-20 ml for adult patients. Complications of autologous epidural blood patch are rare.

A 32-year-old woman presented with low pressure headache 3 days after delivery of her baby. An assessment of postdural puncture headache was made. This was initially treated with analgesia, caffeine, and fluids for the presumed cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) leak. The woman was readmitted two days after her hospital discharge with generalised seizures. A brain scan showed features of intracranial hypotension, and she was treated for CSF leak using an epidural blood patch. Her symptoms worsened and three days later, she developed a left homonymous quadrantanopia. An MRI scan confirmed a right parietal haematoma with evidence of isolated cortical vein thrombosis (ICVT).
