Since the beginning of the neuroleptics in 1952, French psychiatrists have proposed a classification of neuroleptics, taking into account the pharmacological and therapeutic differences between these drugs. They distinguished 3 different clinical effects of neuroleptics: sedative effects, effects on the positive symptoms of schizophrenia and effects on the negative symptoms. The effect of some neuroleptics on negative symptoms is recognized by the international community, which considers clozapine to be effective. In France, in most cases, the indication of clozapine is still refractory paranoid schizophrenia. The effect of this atypical neuroleptic on other types of schizophrenic patient is not well known. Remoxipride appears to be as effective in treating psychotic symptoms and to have fewer side effects than haloperidol. Remoxipride is effective for both positive and negative symptoms. Loxapine has been prescribed in France since 1980. Its pharmacological profile is close to that of clozapine: it has dopamine (D2), histamine (H1), serotonin (5-HT2) and adrenergic (alpha 1)-blocking activities. Its best indication seems to be paranoid schizophrenia, although some data suggest bipolar action. The bipolar action of some new neuroleptics is illustrated by amisulpride, a substitute benzamide derivative. The originality of this molecule lies in its two opposite actions at two distinct doses. Doses of 600-1200 mg/day are effective against positive symptoms; 50-150 mg/day improves negative symptoms. This latter effect could be mediated by activation of the dopamine system.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)

To describe the frequency and trends in the use of antipsychotics for adults with schizophrenia in Canada from 2005 to 2009. Analyses were performed on IMS Brogan's Canadian Disease and Therapeutic Index (CDTI). The CDTI is a national physician panel study consisting of a representative sample of physicians both geographically and by specialty. Weighting adjustments are made to estimate national drug recommendations. Quarterly, panel physicians record all therapeutic recommendations during a 2-day period, including patient age, sex, and indication. Antipsychotic recommendations were estimated using CDTI data in which schizophrenia was listed as the indication. First-generation antipsychotic (FGA) recommendations for adults with schizophrenia increased by 38% between 2005 and 2009, from 329 380 to 454 960 recommendations. There were notable increases in recommendations for chlorpromazine, loxapine, zuclopenthixol, and flupentixol. Second-generation antipsychotic (SGA) recommendations increased to a much lesser extent (9%), which was mostly attributable to an increase in recommendations for clozapine. Drug recommendations for olanzapine decreased by 9%. The rate of increase of FGA use is now greater than that of SGAs. This may be due to data from recent comparative trials, which suggest that clinical efficacy, and the rate of neurological side effects is similar between FGAs and SGAs. The decreasing use of olanzapine may be due to metabolic adverse effects. The increased use of clozapine may be due to data on its superiority in patients who are treatment resistant.
