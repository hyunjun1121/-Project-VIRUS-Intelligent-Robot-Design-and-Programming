How long in bp is the human pseudoautosomal region 2 (PAR2)?

[PMID: 25375121]
The human sex chromosomes differ in sequence, except for the pseudoautosomal regions (PAR) at the terminus of the short and the long arms, denoted as PAR1 and PAR2. The boundary between PAR1 and the unique X and Y sequences was established during the divergence of the great apes. During a copy number variation screen, we noted a paternally inherited chromosome X duplication in 15 independent families. Subsequent genomic analysis demonstrated that an insertional translocation of X chromosomal sequence into the Y chromosome generates an extended PAR [corrected].The insertion is generated by non-allelic homologous recombination between a 548 bp LTR6B repeat within the Y chromosome PAR1 and a second LTR6B repeat located 105 kb from the PAR boundary on the X chromosome. The identification of the reciprocal deletion on the X chromosome in one family and the occurrence of the variant in different chromosome Y haplogroups demonstrate this is a recurrent genomic rearrangement in the human population. This finding represents a novel mechanism shaping sex chromosomal evolution.

A physical map of the human pseudoautosomal region has been constructed using pulsed field gel electrophoresis and the infrequently cutting restriction enzymes BssHIII, EagI, SstII, NotI, MluI and NruI. This map extends 2.3 Mbp from the telomere to sex-chromosome-specific DNA, includes at least seven CpG islands and locates four genetically mapped loci. Five of the CpG islands are organized into two clusters. One cluster is adjacent to the telomere, the other extends into sex-chromosome-specific DNA. There is congruence between the genetic and physical maps which implies that the frequency of recombination is approximately uniform throughout the DNA.

The human Y chromosome is composed of two different parts: a pseudoautosomal region shared with the X chromosome which is responsible for sex chromosome pairing and a Y-specific part that encodes the sex determining gene. Previously we have shown that the pseudoautosomal gene MIC2 only rarely recombines between the sex chromosomes and, based on the elevated recombination rates in the pseudoautosomal region, we predicted that this gene would lie close to the Y-specific region. In this report we describe a test of this prediction using long-range restriction mapping techniques. We conclude that MIC2 is less than 200 kilobases (kb) away from Y-specific sequences. During these experiments we have identified an HTF island in a position consistent with the proposed location of the human sex determining gene.

The pseudoautosomal regions (PAR1 and PAR2) of the human X and Y chromosomes pair and recombine during meiosis. Thus genes in this region are not inherited in a strictly sex-linked fashion. PAR1 is located at the terminal region of the short arms and PAR2 at the tips of the long arms of these chromosomes. To date, 24 genes have been assigned to the PAR1 region. Half of these have a known function. In contrast, so far only 4 genes have been discovered in the PAR2 region. Deletion of the PAR1 region results in failure of pairing and male sterility. The gene SHOX (short stature homeobox-containing) resides in PAR1. SHOX haploinsufficiency contributes to certain features in Turner syndrome as well as the characteristics of Leri-Weill dyschondrosteosis. Only two of the human PAR1 genes have mouse homologues. These do not, however, reside in the mouse PAR1 region but are autosomal. The PAR regions seem to be relics of differential additions, losses, rearrangements and degradation of the X and Y chromosome in different mammalian lineages. Marsupials have three homologues of human PAR1 genes in their autosomes, although, in contrast to mouse, do not have a PAR region at all. The disappearance of PAR from other species seems likely and this region will only be rescued by the addition of genes to both X and Y, as has occurred already in lemmings. The present review summarizes the current understanding of the evolution of PAR and provides up-to-date information about individual genes residing in this region.

The 320-kb human pseudoautosomal region 2 (PAR2) at the tips of the long arms of the X and Y chromosomes is thought to have been duplicated onto the Y chromosome recently in primate evolution. The four genes within PAR2 have been proposed to constitute two zones with different base ratios and transcription, one of which was added recently to the X chromosome. To test this hypothesis, we cloned and mapped PAR2 genes in other species, the lemur, the cat, and a marsupial, the tammar wallaby. None of the human PAR2 genes colocalized with human PAR1 genes in the marsupial genome, confirming that the human PAR1 and PAR2 evolved independently. Of the four PAR2 genes, only SYBL1 was located on the X chromosome in all species, including marsupials, so it was part of the ancient X. HSPRY3 localized to the X in all the eutherians, but not marsupial, so it must have been added to the X 80-130 million years ago. CXYorf1 was present on the X in primates and also in mouse, but autosomal in wallaby, suggesting a later addition 70-130 million years ago, and IL9R was on the X only in primate, suggesting addition 60-70 million years ago. The results therefore demonstrate that at least two independent additions were necessary for PAR2 evolution. The present gene order on the human X also requires two inversions. The complicated evolutionary pathway supports the hypothesis that terminal interchromosomal rearrangements are common in regions unpaired at meiosis.
