Which gene mutation is associated with Woodhouse Sakati syndrome?

[PMID: 30409855]
Woodhouse-Sakati syndrome is a rare autosomal recessive disorder characterized by hypogonadism, alopecia, diabetes mellitus, and progressive extrapyramidal signs. The disease is caused by biallelic pathogenic variants in the <i>DCAF17</i> gene. The purpose of this study was to describe the spectrum of brain MR imaging abnormalities in Woodhouse-Sakati syndrome. We reviewed brain MR images of 26 patients with a clinical and genetic diagnosis of Woodhouse-Sakati syndrome (12 males, 14 females; age range, 16-45 years; mean age, 26.6 years). Follow-up studies were conducted for 6 patients. All patients had abnormal MR imaging findings. The most common abnormalities were a small pituitary gland (76.9%), pronounced basal ganglia iron deposition (73%), and white matter lesions in 69.2%. White matter lesions showed frontoparietal and periventricular predominance. All white matter lesions spared subcortical U-fibers and were nonenhanced. Prominent perivascular spaces (15.3%) and restricted diffusion in the splenium of the corpus callosum (7.6%) were less frequent findings. Follow-up studies showed expansion of white matter lesions with iron deposition further involving the red nucleus and substantia nigra. Older age was associated with a more severe degree of white matter lesions (<i>P</i> < .001). Small pituitary gland, accentuated iron deposition in the globus pallidus, and nonenhancing frontoparietal/periventricular white matter lesions were the most noted abnormalities seen in our cohort. The pattern and extent of these findings were observed to correlate with older age, reflecting a possible progressive myelin destruction and/or axonal loss. The presence of pituitary hypoplasia and white matter lesions can further distinguish Woodhouse-Sakati syndrome from other neurodegenerative diseases with brain iron accumulation subtypes.

Two consanguineous Qatari siblings presented for evaluation: a 17-4/12-year-old male with hypogonadotropic hypogonadism, alopecia, intellectual disability, and microcephaly and his 19-year-old sister with primary amenorrhea, alopecia, and normal cognition. Both required hormone treatment to produce secondary sex characteristics and pubertal development beyond Tanner 1. SNP array analysis of both probands was performed to detect shared regions of homozygosity which may harbor homozygous mutations in a gene causing their common features of abnormal pubertal development, alopecia, and variable cognitive delay. Our patients shared multiple homozygous genomic regions; ten shared regions were >1 Mb in length and constituted 0.99% of the genome. DCAF17, encoding a transmembrane nuclear protein of uncertain function, was the only gene identified in a homozygous region known to cause hypogonadotropic hypogonadism. DCAF17 mutations are associated with Woodhouse-Sakati syndrome, a rare disorder characterized by alopecia, hypogonadotropic hypogonadism, sensorineural hearing loss, diabetes mellitus, and extrapyramidal movements. Sequencing of the coding exons and flanking intronic regions of DCAF17 in the proband revealed homozygosity for a previously described founder mutation (c.436delC). Targeted DCAF17 sequencing of his affected sibling revealed the same homozygous mutation. This family illustrates the utility of SNP array testing in consanguineous families to efficiently and inexpensively identify regions of genomic homozygosity in which genetic candidates for recessive conditions can be identified.

Woodhouse Sakati syndrome (WSS, MIM 241080) is a rare autosomal recessive genetic condition characterized by alopecia, hypogonadism, hearing impairment, diabetes mellitus, learning disabilities and extrapydamidal manifestations. Sequence variants in the gene DCAF17, encoding nucleolar substrate receptor, were identified as the underlying cause of inherited WSS. Considerable phenotypic heterogeneity exists in WSS with regard to severity, organs involvement and age of onset, both in inter-familial and intra-familial cases. In this study, the genetic characterization of a consanguineous pedigree showing mild features of WSS was performed, followed by structural analysis of truncated protein. Exome sequencing identified a novel single base deletion variant (c.270delA; K90Nfs8*) in third exon of the gene DCAF17 (RefSeq; NM_025000), resulting in a truncated protein. Structural analysis of truncated DCAF17 revealed absence of amino acid residues crucial for interaction with DDB1. Taken together, the data confirmed the single base pair deletion as the underlying cause of this second report of WSS from Pakistan. This signifies the vital yet unexplored role of DCAF17 both in development and maintenance of adult tissues homeostasis.

BACKGROUND Woodhouse-Sakati syndrome (WSS) is a rare autosomal recessive genetic condition that was first described in 1983. Since its original description, approximately 50 cases have been reported with various clinical signs and symptoms. Characteristics include progressive neurologic deterioration with extrapyramidal involvement and polyendocrinopathy most notable for hypogonadism starting in early adolescence. Clinical presentation is variable, and a subset of patients may have additional features, such as premature aging, alopecia, distinctive facial features, cognitive impairment, or deafness. CASE REPORT We illustrate the phenotypic variability of 5 patients with WSS due to the previously reported homozygous single nucleotide deletion c.436delC in the DCAF17 gene, identified in 2008. Despite identical genetic alteration, our 5 patients had various clinical features among them and compared with previously reported cases with the same pathogenic mutation. CONCLUSIONS The phenotypic variability of WSS due to c.436delC founder mutation may have a wider range than previously recognized.

First described in 1983, Woodhouse-Sakati syndrome (WSS) is a rare autosomal recessive genetic disorder that leads to a spectrum of hypogonadal symptoms in adolescence. The responsible gene, DCAF17 located on chromosome 2q31.1, was discovered in 2008 and to date nine mutations have been reported in the literature. The aim of the study was to review WSS descriptively in the light of new case reports with focus on endocrine features. Phenotypic description of three patients (two females, one male) with WSS followed in the Endocrinology Department of the University Hospital of Nancy, France, and exhaustive review of the literature using the PUBMED database were performed. Of 72 patients from 29 families with documented WSS who were identified, 39 had undergone genetic testing. WSS was invariably associated with hypogonadism, decreased IGF1 and frontotemporal alopecia starting in childhood. In addition to this triad, some patients exhibited intellectual disabilities of varying severity (87 %), bilateral deafness (76 %), cervicofacial dystonia and limb pain (42 % of cases, rising to 89 % after 25 years) and diabetes (66 %, rising to 96 % after 25 years). The pathophysiology of WSS remains unclear.
