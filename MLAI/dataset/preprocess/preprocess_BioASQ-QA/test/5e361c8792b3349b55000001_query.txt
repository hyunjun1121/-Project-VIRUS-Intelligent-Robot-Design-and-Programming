What is dystopia canthorum?

[PMID: 21915450]
Waardenburg syndrome (WS) type I is a non-progressive auditory-pigmentary disorder comprising congenital sensorineural hearing loss and pigmentary disturbances of the iris, hair, and skin, along with dystopia canthorum (lateral displacement of the inner canthi). Affected individuals may have higher risk of: neural tube defects, cleft lip and palate, limb abnormalities, and Hirschsprung disease. The diagnosis is clinical and should be considered if the individual has two major or one major plus two minor criteria. PAX3 is the only known gene associated to the syndrome. Nevertheless, its use is mostly for genetic counseling. Regarding different diagnosis, we may list: other causes of non-progressive auditory-pigmentary disorder comprising congenital sensorineural hearing loss, other types of Waardenburg syndrome, piebaldism, albinism, vitiligo and Teitz syndrome. This paper presents a case of an eleven year old boy with deafness and ophthalmologic alterations, based on his files and exams. It reinforced the importance of the ophthalmologist contributing for the diagnosis of this rare systemic disease, as it includes some ophthalmologic alterations. We remind that the early diagnosis allows adequate stimulation for the hearing loss, as well as preventive measures in case of pregnant women affected by genetic counseling.

Waardenburg syndrome (WS) is a genetic disorder of which there are four distinct types. These four types are differentiated by the physical defects which they produce. Presented here is the case of a 13-year-old boy with WS Type I who was observed and physically assessed in Mali, West Africa in 1969. His physical findings included a bright blue coloring to the irises of the eyes, profound sensorineural deafness, mutism, dystopia canthorum (lateral displacement of the inner canthi of the eyes), broad nasal root, bushy eyebrows, and scaphoid deformities of the supraorbital portions of the frontal bone. Because family members were not available for interviews or physical examinations, it was not possible to determine if this patient was suffering from a congenital form of the disorder or from a spontaneous mutation. Given the patient's then location in a remote rural area of Mali where electricity was absent, it was not possible to perform additional diagnostic tests. The patient described here is the first with WS in Mali, West Africa to have been medically observed and evaluated and later documented in the medical literature. A second case of the syndrome in Mali was described in the medical literature in 2011 in an 18-month-old infant who did not have sensorineural hearing loss, but who did have a bilateral cleft lip. An historical overview of WS is presented along with details concerning the characteristics of the four types of the disorder.

Waardenburg's syndrome consists of lateral displacement of the inner canthi of the eyes (dystopia canthorum), a broad nasal root and confluent eyebrows, heterochromia iridum, a white forelock and congenital deafness. The syndrome is inherited as a dominant, but affected individuals do not necessarily have all of the characteristics cited.Five hundred and fourteen pupils at a school for the deaf were screened for features of this syndrome. Three cases were discovered. Eleven other deaf children were found to have heterochromia iridum and two more had white forelocks. The interocular dimensions of the remaining children were recorded as standards by which to judge the presence of dystopia canthorum. The results of chromosomal analysis in two cases with Waardenburg's syndrome were normal.The findings provide further evidence that Waardenburg's syndrome is a distinct entity and call in question Mackenzie's concept of a comprehensive "first arch syndrome".
