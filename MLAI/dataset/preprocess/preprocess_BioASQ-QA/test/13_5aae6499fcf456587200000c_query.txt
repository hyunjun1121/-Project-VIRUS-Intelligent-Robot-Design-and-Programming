The probe-based Velogene Rapid MRSA Identification Assay (ID Biomedical Corp., Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada) and the latex agglutination MRSA-Screen (Denka Seiken Co., Tokyo, Japan) were evaluated for their ability to identify methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) and to distinguish strains of MRSA from borderline oxacillin-resistant S. aureus (BORSA; mecA-negative, oxacillin MICs of 2 to 8 microgram/ml). The Velogene is a 90-min assay using a chimeric probe to detect the mecA gene. MRSA-Screen is a 15-min latex agglutination test with penicillin-binding protein 2a antibody-sensitized latex particles. We compared these assays with the BBL Crystal MRSA ID System (Becton Dickinson, Cockeysville, Md.) and with PCR for mecA gene detection. A total of 397 clinical isolates of S. aureus were tested, consisting of 164 methicillin-susceptible strains, 197 MRSA strains, and 37 BORSA strains. All assays performed well for the identification of MRSA with sensitivities and specificities for Velogene, MRSA-Screen, and BBL Crystal MRSA ID of 98.5 and 100%, 98.5 and 100%, and 98.5 and 98%, respectively. Three MRSA strains were not correctly identified by each of the Velogene and MRSA-Screen assays, but repeat testing with a larger inoculum resolved the discrepancies. The BBL Crystal MRSA ID test misclassified four BORSA strains as MRSA. Both the Velogene and the MRSA-Screen assays are easy to perform, can accurately differentiate BORSA isolates from MRSA isolates, and provide a rapid alternative for the detection of methicillin resistance in S. aureus in clinical laboratories, especially when mecA PCR gene detection is unavailable.

Optimal therapeutic strategies for serious infections caused by borderline and heterotypic oxacillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (BORSA and ORSA) strains have not been fully characterized. Recent evidence suggests that the dominant penicillin-binding protein of ORSA strains (PBP 2a) shows good affinity for ampicillin and that these strains commonly produce beta-lactamase. Therefore, we compared the in vivo efficacy of the combination of ampicillin plus sulbactam with that of vancomycin against ORSA strains. Also, the moderate resistance of BORSA strains appears to be attributable mainly to the hyperproduction of beta-lactamase. Therefore, we also studied the in vivo efficacy of ampicillin plus sulbactam against such organisms. Experimental aortic endocarditis was induced in rabbits by the following three strains: beta-lactamase-producing BORSA strain VP-986, beta-lactamase-producing ORSA strain 67-0, and its beta-lactamase-negative clone. In animals with BORSA endocarditis, ampicillin plus sulbactam and oxacillin were highly effective in reducing mean intravegetation bacterial densities, with each being significantly better than either ampicillin alone or no therapy. In animals with endocarditis caused by the beta-lactamase-producing ORSA strain, ampicillin plus sulbactam was significantly better at reducing mean vegetation bacterial densities than the other regimens. For endocarditis caused by the beta-lactamase-negative ORSA clone, ampicillin was better than vancomycin in reducing mean intravegetation bacterial densities. These data show that infections caused by beta-lactamase-producing BORSA strains respond therapeutically in a manner similar to that of infections caused by oxacillin-susceptible strains, with both oxacillin and ampicillin plus sulbactam being highly efficacious. Moreover, high-dose ampicillin treatment strategies were effective in the therapy of ORSA endocarditis; this efficacy is presumably related to the relatively high affinity profile of this compound (compare with that of oxacillin) for the functionally dominant ORSA PBP 2a.

Borderline oxacillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (BORSA) exhibit oxacillin MIC values of 1-8 microg ml(-1), but lack mecA, which encodes the low-affinity penicillin-binding protein (PBP)2a. The relationship of the BORSA phenotype with specific genetic backgrounds was assessed, as well as amino acid sequence variation in the normal PBP2. Among 38 BORSA, 26 had a common PFGE profile of genomic DNA, and were multilocus sequence type (ST)25. The other isolates were genetically diverse. Complete pbp2 sequences were determined for three BORSA, corresponding to ST25, ST1 and ST47, which were selected on the basis of lacking blaZ-encoded beta-lactamase. The essential transpeptidase-domain-encoding segment of pbp2 was also sequenced from seven additional ST25 isolates. Amino acid substitutions occurred in the transpeptidase domain of all BORSA, irrespective of clonal type. A Gln(629)-->Pro substitution was common to all ST25 BORSA, but most could be distinguished from one another by additional unique substitutions in the transpeptidase domain. The ST1 and ST47 isolates also possessed unique substitutions in the transpeptidase domain. Plasmid-mediated expression of pbp2 from an ST25 or ST1 isolate in S. aureus RN6390 increased its oxacillin MIC from 0.25 to 4 microg ml(-1), while pbp2 from a susceptible strain, ATCC 25923, had no effect. Therefore, different amino acid substitutions in PBP2 of diverse BORSA lineages contribute to borderline resistance. The predominant ST25 lineage was not related to any of the five clonal complexes that contain meticillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA), suggesting that ST25 cannot readily acquire mecA-mediated resistance.

Borderline oxacillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (BORSA) represents a quite poorly understood and inadequately defined phenotype of methicillin resistance. BORSA strains show low, borderline resistance to penicillinase-resistant penicillins (PRPs), with oxacillin MICs typically equal to 1-8 µg ml<sup>-1</sup>, and in contrast to methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA), do not have an altered penicillin-binding protein, PBP2a, encoded by the mecA or mecC gene. Their resistance is typically associated with hyperproduction of beta-lactamases or, in some cases, point mutations in PBP genes. BORSA cannot be classified as either truly methicillin-resistant or truly methicillin-susceptible strains. However, they are frequently misidentified, which poses an obvious epidemiological and therapeutic threat. BORSA strains are commonly isolated from humans and animals, and are found both in hospitals and in a community setting. The epidemiology and clinical presentation of BORSA infections seem to be similar to those for MRSA; these infections are usually more severe than those caused by methicillin-sensitive S. aureus (MSSA). Treatment of severe infections caused by BORSA may be ineffective, even with larger doses of oxacillin. The available evidence suggests that BORSA represent a frequently neglected problem, and their emergence in new environments implies that they need to be monitored and accurately distinguished from MSSA and MRSA.

Eighty-eight Staphylococcus aureus clinical isolates meeting criteria for borderline oxacillin resistance (intermediate susceptibility or resistance to oxacillin but susceptibility to amoxicillin/clavulanic acid upon disk diffusion testing) were studied to determine optimal test techniques and conditions for differentiating borderline oxacillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (BORSA) from methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA). Further testing revealed three distinct resistance patterns: 61 strains (69%) consistently met BORSA criteria and had average beta-lactamase levels five- to six-fold higher than oxacillin-susceptible controls; 11 strains (13%) were markedly heteroresistant MRSA with delayed appearance of resistant colonies leading to spurious susceptibility to amoxicillin/clavulanic acid; 16 strains (18%) appeared to be oxacillin-susceptible on repetitive testing. Under conditions used to elicit intrinsic methicillin resistance in Staphylococcus aureus, a large percentage of BORSA appeared resistant to amoxicillin/clavulanic acid. This clearly shows that BORSA may be misidentified as MRSA while heteroresistant MRSA may appear to be BORSA. It is concluded that amoxicillin/clavulanic acid zone sizes should be measured after a full 24 hours of incubation, that susceptibility testing of Staphylococcus aureus under certain environmental conditions should be interpreted with caution, and that MIC testing is the most reliable technique for differentiating these two resistance patterns in Staphylococcus aureus.

The genotypes and oxacillin resistance of 263 Staphylococcus aureus isolates cultured from chicken cloacae (n = 138) and chicken meat (n = 125) was analyzed. Fifteen spa types were determined in the studied S. aureus population. Among 5 staphylococcal protein A gene (spa) types detected in S. aureus from chicken, t002, t3478, and t13620 were the most frequent. Staphylococcus aureus isolates from meat were assigned to 14 spa types. Among them, the genotypes t002, t056, t091, t3478, and t13620 were dominant. Except for 4 chicken S. aureus isolates belonging to CC398, the remaining 134 isolates were clustered into multilocus sequence clonal complex (CC) 5. Most of meat-derived isolates were assigned to CC5, CC7, and CC15, and to the newly described spa-CC12954 complex belonging to CC1. Except for t011 (CC398), all other spa types found among chicken isolates were also present in isolates from meat. Four S. aureus isolated from chicken and one from meat were identified as methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA) with oxacillin minimum inhibitory concentrations from 16 to 64 μg/mL. All MRSA were assigned to spa types belonging to ST398, and included 4 animal spa t011 SCCmecV isolates and 1 meat-derived spa t899, SCCmecIV isolate. Borderline oxacillin-resistant S. aureus (BORSA) isolates, shown to grow on plates containing 2 to 3 μg/mL of oxacillin, were found within S. aureus isolates from chicken (3 isolates) and from meat (19 isolates). The spa t091 and t084 dominated among BORSA from chicken meat, whereas t548 and t002 were found within animal BORSA. We report for the first time the presence of MRSA in chicken in Poland. We demonstrate that MRSA CC398 could be found in chicken meat indicating potential of introduction of animal-associated genotypes into the food chain. We also report for the first time the possibility of transmission of BORSA isolates from chicken to meat.

Borderline oxacillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (BORSA) may be misidentified as intrinsically methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) in the clinical laboratory. Under disk diffusion testing conditions designed to maximize detection of MRSA (incubation at 32 degrees C, pre-induction with methicillin, or plating on 4% NaCl-supplemented agar), BORSA strains also tend to appear resistant to semisynthetic penicillins. Under these conditions, ampicillin/sulbactam appears to be more accurate than amoxicillin/clavulanic acid for differentiating BORSA from MRSA.

In many hospitals in the world and in our country, the spread of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) is so wide that nowdays vancomycin is recommended for empiric treatment of staphylococcal life threatening infections (sepsis, pneumonia) instead of beta-lactam antibiotics. The aim of this study was to determine the production of beta-lactamases in hospital and community isolates of staphyloococus aureus, i.e. hospital associated MRSA (HA-MRSA) and community associated MRSA (CA-MRSA), the presence of homogeneous and heterogeneous type of methicillin resistance, and border-line resistance in Staphylococcus aureus (BORSA). The aim of this study was also to determine if there was a statistically significant difference between mechanisms of resistance in HA-MRSA and CA-MRSA. A total 216 clinical Staphylococcus aureus isolates from the General Hospital in the town of Cuprija and 186 ambulance Staphylococcus aureus isolates from the community were examined for the presence of methicillin-resistance using disk-diffusion test with penicillin disk (10 ij), oxacillin disk (1 microg) and cefoxitin disk (30 microg). Beta-lactamases production was detected by nitrocefin disk and beta-lactamase tablets. Determination of oxacillin minimum inhibitory concentracion (MIC) was done by agar-dilution method. The prevalence of HA-MRSA was 57.4%, and CA-MRSA was 17.7% (p < 0.05). There was a higher rate of heterogeneous type of resistance among clinical MRSA isolates (11.1%) compared with ambulance ones (3.8%) (p < 0.05). The rates of beta-lactamases production were similar among hospital associated isolates (97.5%), as well as in the community associated isolates (95.5%) (p > 0.05). There were 4.6% of BORSA hospital isolates and 3.3% of BORSA ambulance isolates (p > 0.05). The frequency of MRSA isolates in hospital was significantly higher than in community, as well as the heterogeneous type of resistance. The frequency of BORSA isolates and production of beta-lactamases were higher among hospital Staphylococcus aureus isolates, but the difference is not significant.

A total of 70 Staphylococcus aureus isolates from postoperative infections in hospitalized horses were isolated between January 2005 and January 2011. Among them, 12 isolates were methicillin-susceptible S. aureus (MSSA), 18 were borderline-oxacillin-resistant S. aureus (BORSA), and 40 were methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA). During the same period, the equine clinic personnel were screened for nasal carriage of BORSA and MRSA. Genotyping revealed that BORSA ST1(MLST)-t2863(spa) isolates were responsible for most equine infections and were the main isolates found in colonized members of the personnel between 2005 and 2007, and that in 2007, MRSA ST398-t011-IVa(SCCmec) emerged in infection sites and personnel, replacing BORSA. Besides decreased susceptibility to oxacillin, all MRSA and BORSA of these two major clonal lineages displayed resistance to gentamicin and kanamycin conferred by the aac(6')-Ie-aph(2')-Ia gene and to trimethoprim conferred by dfr(K) in MRSA and dfr(A) in BORSA. All MRSA had additional resistance to tetracycline conferred by tet(M), whereas BORSA generally also display resistance to streptomycin conferred by str. The number of hospital-acquired MRSA infections in horses could be limited after the introduction of basic hygiene measures and personnel decolonization. Two MRSA carriers could not be decolonized using mupirocin, and a year after decolonization, additional members were recolonized with MRSA. Hygiene measures should, therefore, be maintained to limit the transmission of S. aureus between personnel and horses.

The aim of the study was to determine the frequency and type of MRSA strains and antibiotic susceptibility in Al-Zahra Hospital, Isfahan, Iran. In an analytic descriptive survey in 2005 and early 2006, patients admitted to the hospital who contracted S. aureus nosocomial infections were enrolled in the study. All isolates were identified by the conventional laboratory tests. Minimal Inhibitory Concentration (MIC) of oxacillin on isolated bacteria was determined by E-Test method. According to Clinical and Laboratory Standard Institute (CLSI) criteria all strains with MIC of > or = 4 microg for oxacillin were identified as MRSA. Intrinsic high level resistance (mecA positive) and borderline oxacillin resistant Staphylococcus aureus (BORSA) were detected by amoxicillin-clavulanate E-test strips. Strains with MIC of > or = 4 microg for oxacillin and > or = 8 microg for amoxicillin-clavulanate were identified as mecA positive MRSA. Other staphylococcus with MIC > or = 4 microg for oxacillin and < or = 4 for amoxicillin-clavulanate were identified as mecA negative MRSA (BORSA). MIC of vancomycin also was determined on isolated bacteria. Data were analyzed by SPSS version 13 and Who net version 5. Out of 134 Staphylococcus aureus samples which were isolated from nosocomial infections 90 (67.2%) were MRSA. Sixty seven out of 90 (74.5%) MRSA were mecA positive and 23 out of 90 (25.5%) were mecA negative (BORSA). Although most of the MRSA strains were isolated from surgical site infections, there were no statistically significant differences between types of Staphylococcus aureus growing from variant sites of infections. Only one (1.49) of the mecA positive MRSA had reduced susceptibility to vancomycin but all of the mecA-negative MRSA (BORSA) were sensitive to it. Because one fourth of our staphylococcus strains are mecA negative BORSA and there is no alternative for vancomycin against mecA positive MRSA and Enterococcus spp. in our hospital, vancomycin should be reserved only for life threatening infections due to these organisms. Thus MRSA typing should be done to choose appropriate antibiotic for optimal treatment of MRSA infections.

Clinical evidence for failure with beta-lactam therapy has been lacking for patients with borderline oxacillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (BORSA) infections. We describe a failure of cloxacillin for a patient with endocarditis due to BORSA. The isolate also had false-negative thermonuclease and coagulase test results.

Since it is unknown whether β-lactam antimicrobial agents can be used effectively against borderline oxacillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (BORSA) with oxacillin MICs ≥4 mg/L, the in vitro bactericidal activity and pharmacodynamic effect of oxacillin against clinical BORSA isolates was evaluated. Time-kill experiments with oxacillin were performed and the results compared with those obtained with vancomycin, daptomycin and linezolid against BORSA with oxacillin MICs ≥4 mg/L and BORSA with oxacillin MICs ≤2 mg/L. Furthermore, the effect of β-lactamase production and plasmid profile analysis were taken into account to clarify responses to oxacillin. Oxacillin killing activity was attenuated against BORSA compared with ATCC 29213 since the pharmacodynamic parameters revealed that the potency of oxacillin was markedly reduced (c. ten-fold) against BORSA with oxacillin MICs ≥4 mg/L. pBORa53-like plasmid-containing BORSA with oxacillin MICs ≤2 mg/L showed markedly more regrowth. In conclusion, oxacillin was non-effective in the eradication of either (i) BORSA with oxacillin MICs ≥4 mg/L or (ii) β-lactamase-hyperproducing BORSA (MICs ≤2 mg/L). Further investigation into β-lactam dosing strategies against different BORSA strains is warranted in order to avoid possible therapy failure.

Selective chromogenic media allowing one-step meticillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) isolation and identification are widely used. However, the changing epidemiology of MRSA means that the suitability of these chromogenic media requires investigation. To evaluate the following chromogenic media - Colorex MRSA, MRSA Select II, ChromID MRSA, and MRSA Brilliance 2 - for the detection of divergent strain types. We used a diverse collection of S. aureus, including strains harbouring the mecC gene, strains expressing varying levels of meticillin resistance, and isolates recovered from patient samples. MRSA Select II, Colorex MRSA, and ChromID each grew at a density of 1.5 × 10(1)cfu/mL for each SCCmec type investigated. Brilliance 2 demonstrated growth at 1.5 × 10(1)cfu/mL for mecC MRSA but at a higher density (1.5 × 10(4)cfu/mL) for the three mecA MRSA strains. All four media demonstrated excellent sensitivity for MRSA detection (≥99%), but reduced levels of specificity (85-73%) when challenged with a range of meticillin-susceptible S. aureus (MSSA) isolates. High levels of false positives (∼50%) were also obtained with all chromogenic media when tested with mec-negative borderline oxacillin-resistant S. aureus (BORSA) isolates. Although false positives may be obtained with some strains of MSSA and BORSA, the high sensitivity of these media and their ability to recover almost all MRSA tested (including oxacillin-susceptible and mecC-positive strains) confirm the value of chromogenic agar in MRSA detection.
