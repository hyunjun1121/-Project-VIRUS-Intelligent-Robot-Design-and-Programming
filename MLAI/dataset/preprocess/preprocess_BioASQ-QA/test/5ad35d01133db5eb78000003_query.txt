What is the genetic cause of Roberts syndrome?

[PMID: 26729373]
Roberts syndrome (RBS) is a human developmental disorder caused by mutations in the cohesin acetyltransferase ESCO2. We previously reported that mTORC1 signaling was depressed and overall translation was reduced in RBS cells and zebrafish models for RBS. Treatment of RBS cells and zebrafish RBS models with L-leucine partially rescued mTOR function and protein synthesis, correlating with increased cell division and improved development. In this study, we use RBS cells to model mTORC1 repression and analyze transcription and translation with ribosome profiling to determine gene-level effects of L-leucine. L-leucine treatment partially rescued translational efficiency of ribosomal subunits, translation initiation factors, snoRNA production, and mitochondrial function in RBS cells, consistent with these processes being mTORC1 controlled. In contrast, other genes are differentially expressed independent of L-leucine treatment, including imprinted genes such as H19 and GTL2, miRNAs regulated by GTL2, HOX genes, and genes in nucleolar associated domains. Our study distinguishes between gene expression changes in RBS cells that are TOR dependent and those that are independent. Some of the TOR independent gene expression changes likely reflect the architectural role of cohesin in chromatin looping and gene expression. This study reveals the dramatic rescue effects of L-leucine stimulation of mTORC1 in RBS cells and supports that normal gene expression and translation requires ESCO2 function.

Robert syndrome (RBS) and Cornelia de Lange syndrome (CdLS) are human developmental disorders characterized by craniofacial deformities, limb malformation and mental retardation. These birth defects are collectively termed cohesinopathies as both arise from mutations in cohesion genes. CdLS arises due to autosomal dominant mutations or haploinsufficiencies in cohesin subunits (<i>SMC1A</i>, <i>SMC3</i> and <i>RAD21</i>) or cohesin auxiliary factors (<i>NIPBL</i> and <i>HDAC8</i>) that result in transcriptional dysregulation of developmental programs. RBS arises due to autosomal recessive mutations in cohesin auxiliary factor <i>ESCO2</i>, the gene that encodes an N-acetyltransferase which targets the SMC3 subunit of the cohesin complex. The mechanism that underlies RBS, however, remains unknown. A popular model states that RBS arises due to mitotic failure and loss of progenitor stem cells through apoptosis. Previous findings in the zebrafish regenerating fin, however, suggest that Esco2<i>-</i>knockdown results in transcription dysregulation, independent of apoptosis, similar to that observed in CdLS patients. Previously, we used the clinically relevant <i>CX43</i> to demonstrate a transcriptional role for Esco2. <i>CX43</i> is a gap junction gene conserved among all vertebrates that is required for direct cell-cell communication between adjacent cells such that <i>cx43</i> mutations result in oculodentodigital dysplasia. Here, we show that morpholino-mediated knockdown of <i>smc3</i> reduces <i>cx43</i> expression and perturbs zebrafish bone and tissue regeneration similar to those previously reported for <i>esco2</i> knockdown. Also similar to Esco2-dependent phenotypes, Smc3-dependent bone and tissue regeneration defects are rescued by transgenic Cx43 overexpression, suggesting that Smc3 and Esco2 cooperatively act to regulate cx43 transcription. In support of this model, chromatin immunoprecipitation assays reveal that Smc3 binds to a discrete region of the <i>cx43</i> promoter, suggesting that Esco2 exerts transcriptional regulation of <i>cx43</i> through modification of Smc3 bound to the <i>cx43</i> promoter. These findings have the potential to unify RBS and CdLS as transcription-based mechanisms.

Roberts syndrome and SC phocomelia syndrome are rare autosomal recessive genetic disorders representing the extremes of the spectrum of severity of the same condition, caused by mutations in ESCO2 gene. We report three new patients with Roberts syndrome from three unrelated consanguineous Egyptian families. All patients presented with growth retardation, mesomelic shortening of the limbs more in the upper than in the lower limbs and microcephaly. Patients were subjected to clinical, cytogenetic and radiologic examinations. Cytogenetic analysis showed the characteristic premature separation of centromeres and puffing of heterochromatic regions. Further, sequencing of the ESCO2 gene identified a novel mutation c.244_245dupCT (p.T83Pfs*20) in one family besides two previously reported mutations c.760_761insA (p.T254Nfs*27) and c.764_765delTT (p.F255Cfs*25). All mutations were in homozygous state, in exon 3. The severity of the mesomelic shortening of the limbs and craniofacial anomalies showed variability among patients. Interestingly, patient 1 had abnormal skin hypopigmentation. Serial fetal ultrasound examinations and measurements of long bones diagnosed two affected fetuses in two of the studied families. A literature review and case comparison was performed. In conclusion, we report a novel ESCO2 mutation and expand the clinical spectrum of Roberts syndrome.

Sister chromatid cohesion, mediated by cohesin complex and established by the acetyltransferases Esco1 and Esco2, is essential for faithful chromosome segregation. Mutations in Esco2 cause Roberts syndrome, a developmental disease characterized by severe prenatal retardation as well as limb and facial abnormalities. However, its exact roles during oocyte meiosis have not clearly defined. Here, we report that Esco2 localizes to the chromosomes during oocyte meiotic maturation. Depletion of Esco2 by morpholino microinjection leads to the precocious polar body extrusion, the escape of metaphase I arrest induced by nocodazole treatment and the loss of BubR1 from kinetochores, indicative of inactivated SAC. Furthermore, depletion of Esco2 causes a severely impaired spindle assembly and chromosome alignment, accompanied by the remarkably elevated incidence of defective kinetochore-microtubule attachments which consequently lead to the generation of aneuploid eggs. Notably, we find that the involvement of Esco2 in SAC and kinetochore functions is mediated by its binding to histone H4 and acetylation of H4K16 both in vivo and in vitro. Thus, our data assign a novel meiotic function to Esco2 beyond its role in the cohesion establishment during mouse oocyte meiosis.

Genetic mapping studies reveal that mutations in cohesion pathways are responsible for multispectrum developmental abnormalities termed cohesinopathies. These include Roberts syndrome (RBS), Cornelia de Lange Syndrome (CdLS), and Warsaw Breakage Syndrome (WABS). The cohesinopathies are characterized by overlapping phenotypes ranging from craniofacial deformities, limb defects, and mental retardation. Though these syndromes share a similar suite of phenotypes and arise due to mutations in a common cohesion pathway, the underlying mechanisms are currently believed to be distinct. Defects in mitotic failure and apoptosis i.e. trans DNA tethering events are believed to be the underlying cause of RBS, whereas the underlying cause of CdLS is largely modeled as occurring through defects in transcriptional processes i.e. cis DNA tethering events. Here, we review recent findings described primarily in zebrafish, paired with additional studies in other model systems, including human patient cells, which challenge the notion that cohesinopathies represent separate syndromes. We highlight numerous studies that illustrate the utility of zebrafish to provide novel insights into the phenotypes, genes affected and the possible mechanisms underlying cohesinopathies. We propose that transcriptional deregulation is the predominant mechanism through which cohesinopathies arise. Developmental Dynamics 246:881-888, 2017. Â© 2017 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.
