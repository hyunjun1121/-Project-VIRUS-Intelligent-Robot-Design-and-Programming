With which cancers has the loss of SMARCB1 been associated?

Loss of SMARCB1/INI1 expression is considered to be a hallmark for childhood chordomas (CCs). Although mutation/loss of 22q has strongly established the loss of SMARCB1/INI1 in cancers, the cause in CCs remains elusive. Recent studies suggest role of miRNAs in regulation of SMARCB1/INI1 expressions. We examined 5 reported/target predicted miRNAs to SMARCB1/INI1 in SMARCB1/INI1 immunonegative and immunopositive cases, and found upregulation of miR-671-5p and miR-193a-5p in SMARCB1/INI1-immunonegative cases. Notably, these two miRNAs were significantly predicted to target TGF-β signaling, suggestive of dysregulation of developmental and osteoblast regulation pathway in CCs. Overall, we suggest miR-671-5p- and miR-193a-5p-mediated epigenetic mode of SMARCB1/INI1 loss and downregulated TGF-β pathway in CCs.

Extra-cranial rhabdoid tumors (RT) are highly aggressive malignancies of infancy, characterized by undifferentiated histological features and loss of SMARCB1 expression. The diagnosis is all the more challenging that other poorly differentiated cancers lose SMARCB1 expression, such as epithelioid sarcomas (ES), renal medullary carcinomas (RMC) or undifferentiated chordomas (UC). Moreover, late cases occurring in adults are now increasingly reported, raising the question of differential diagnoses and emphasizing nosological issues. To address this issue, we have analyzed the expression profiles of a training set of 32 SMARCB1-deficient tumors (SDT), with ascertained diagnosis of RT (n = 16, all < 5 years of age), ES (n = 8, all > 10 years of age), UC (n = 3) and RMC (n = 5). As compared with other SDT, RT are characterized by an embryonic signature, and up-regulation of key-actors of de novo DNA methylation processes. Using this signature, we then analysed the expression profiling of 37 SDT to infer the appropriate diagnosis. Thirteen adult onset tumors showed strong similarity with pediatric RT, in spite of older age; by exome sequencing, these tumors also showed genomic features indistinguishable from pediatric RT. In contrary, 8 tumors were reclassified within carcinoma, ES or UC categories, while the remaining could not be related to any of those entities. Our results demonstrate that embryonic signature is shared by all RT, whatever the age at diagnosis; they also illustrate that many adult-onset SDT of ambiguous histological diagnosis are clearly different from RT. Finally, our study paves the way for the routine use of expression-based signatures to give accurate diagnosis of SDT.

Chordomas arise in the skull base and spine and usually occur in adults and are rare in the pediatric population. Cases of chordoma in pediatric age are often poorly differentiated, showing cytologic atypia, increased cellularity, and mitosis, and their aggressive behavior is associated with a high incidence of metastatic spread and a short patient survival. Recent studies have described loss of SMARCB1/INI1 protein in poorly differentiated chordomas associated not with point mutations but with SMARCB1/INI1 gene deletions instead. In this study, we considered immunohistochemistry and SMARCB1/INI1 mutational status to examine SMARCB1 status in a series of pediatric chordomas (7 classic and 1 poorly differentiated). We performed immunohistochemical tests for INI1, brachyury, S100, and cytokeratins and conducted a genetic analysis on the SMARCB1 coding sequence (NM_003073) using the Sanger method and multiplex ligation-dependent probe amplification to detect abnormal copy numbers of the gene locus. All 8 cases were positive for brachyury, whereas there was no nuclear SMARCB1/INI1 expression in 4 of the 8 cases, including the poorly differentiated chordoma. Genetic analysis identified a missense mutation in 2 cases and a nonsense mutation associated with loss of SMARCB1/INI1 protein and features of poorly differentiated tumor in 1. These mutations were novel variants occurring in heterozygosity, and they were judged to be pathogenic by 3 different bioinformatic tools. In 7 of 8 cases we performed multiplex ligation-dependent probe amplification, and 3 cases showed deletions at the SMARCB1 locus. Our results confirm the pathogenic involvement of SMARCB1/INI1 in childhood chordoma. We also describe 3 novel pathogenic mutations.

The molecular mechanisms underlying chordoma pathogenesis are unknown. We therefore sought to identify novel mutations to better understand chordoma biology and to potentially identify therapeutic targets. Given the relatively high costs of whole genome sequencing, we performed a focused genetic analysis using matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization-time of flight mass spectrometer (Sequenom iPLEX genotyping). We tested 865 hotspot mutations in 111 oncogenes and selected tumor suppressor genes (OncoMap v. 3.0) of 45 human chordoma tumor samples. Of the analyzed samples, seven were identified with at least one mutation. Six of these were from fresh frozen samples, and one was from a paraffin embedded sample. These observations were validated using an independent platform using homogeneous mass extend MALDI-TOF (Sequenom hME Genotyping). These genetic alterations include: ALK (A877S), CTNNB1 (T41A), NRAS (Q61R), PIK3CA (E545K), PTEN (R130), CDKN2A (R58*), and SMARCB1 (R40*). This study reports on the largest comprehensive mutational analysis of chordomas performed to date. To focus on mutations that have the greatest chance of clinical relevance, we tested only oncogenes and tumor suppressor genes that have been previously implicated in the tumorigenesis of more common malignancies. We identified rare genetic changes that may have functional significance to the underlying biology and potential therapeutics for chordomas. Mutations in CDKN2A and PTEN occurred in areas of chromosomal copy loss. When this data is paired with the studies showing 18 of 21 chordoma samples displaying copy loss at the locus for CDKN2A, 17 of 21 chordoma samples displaying copy loss at PTEN, and 3 of 4 chordoma samples displaying deletion at the SMARCB1 locus, we can infer that a loss of heterozygosity at these three loci may play a significant role in chordoma pathogenesis.

Identification of loss of SMARCB1/INI1 expression in poorly differentiated (PD) chordoma in pediatric patients suggests that PD chordoma is an entity molecularly distinct from conventional chordoma or atypical teratoid/rhabdoid tumor, which is also characterized by loss of SMARCB1/INI1 expression by inactivating mutation of the SMARCB1/INI gene. So far, around 20 cases of pediatric PD chordoma with loss of SMARCB1/INI1 expression have been reported. Here, we report two cases of pediatric PD chordoma with loss of SMARCB1/INI1 expression, which is very rare among the pediatric chordoma types. Both patients presented clival masses on preoperative MRI. Histologically, both tumors had nonclassic histologic features for conventional chordoma: sheets of large epithelioid to spindle cells with vesicular nuclei and prominent nucleoli. Both cases revealed nuclear expression of brachyury, loss of SMARCB1/INI1 expression and lack of embryonal, neuroectodermal, or epithelial component. One case showed heterozygous loss of EWSR1 gene by break-apart fluorescence in situ hybridization that reflected loss of SMARCB1/INI1 gene. Based on the clival location and histologic findings along with the loss of SMARCB1/INI1 expression and positivity for nuclear brachyury staining, the final pathologic diagnosis for both cases was PD chordoma.
