What is an exosome?

[PMID: 28733901]
Exosomes are nanosized membrane vesicles released by fusion of an organelle of the endocytic pathway, the multivesicular body, with the plasma membrane. This process was discovered more than 30 years ago, and during these years, exosomes have gone from being considered as cellular waste disposal to mediate a novel mechanism of cell-to-cell communication. The exponential interest in exosomes experienced during recent years is due to their important roles in health and disease and to their potential clinical application in therapy and diagnosis. However, important aspects of the biology of exosomes remain unknown. To explore the use of exosomes in the clinic, it is essential that the basic molecular mechanisms behind the transport and function of these vesicles are better understood. We have here summarized what is presently known about how exosomes are formed and released by cells. Moreover, other cellular processes related to exosome biogenesis and release, such as autophagy and lysosomal exocytosis are presented. Finally, methodological aspects related to exosome release studies are discussed.

Exosomes are extracellular vesicles released by the vast majority of cell types both in vivo and ex vivo, upon the fusion of multivesicular bodies (MVBs) with the cellular plasma membrane. Two main functions have been attributed to exosomes: their capacity to transport proteins, lipids and nucleic acids between cells and organs, as well as their potential to act as natural intercellular communicators in normal biological processes and in pathologies. From a clinical perspective, the majority of applications use exosomes as biomarkers of disease. A new approach uses exosomes as biologically active carriers to provide a platform for the enhanced delivery of cargo in vivo. One of the major limitations in developing exosome-based therapies is the difficulty of producing sufficient amounts of safe and efficient exosomes. The identification of potential proteins involved in exosome biogenesis is expected to directly cause a deliberate increase in exosome production. In this review, we summarize the current state of knowledge regarding exosomes, with particular emphasis on their structural features, biosynthesis pathways, production techniques and potential clinical applications.

Dendritic cells (DCs) are the most potent antigen presenting cells and the only ones capable of inducing primary cytotoxic immune responses. We found that DCs secrete a population of membrane vesicles, called exosomes. Exosomes are 60-80 nm vesicles of endocytic origin. The protein composition of exosomes was subjected to a systematic proteomic analysis. Besides MHC and co-stimulatory molecules, exosomes bear several adhesion proteins, most likely involved in their specific subjected to targeting. We also found that exosomes accumulate several cytosolic factors, probably involved in their endosomal biogenesis. Like DCs, exosomes induced immune responses in vivo. Indeed, a single injection of DC-derived exosomes sensitized with tumor peptides induced potent anti tumor immune responses in mice and the eradication of established tumors. Tumor-specific cytotoxic T lymphocytes were found in the spleen of exosome-treated mice, and the anti tumor effect of exosomes was sensitive to in vivo depletion of CD8+ T cells. These results show that exosomes induce potent anti tumor effects in vivo, and strongly support the implementation of human DC-derived exosomes for cancer immunotherapy.

Exosomes are the newest family member of 'bioactive vesicles' that function to promote intercellular communication. Exosomes are derived from the fusion of multivesicular bodies with the plasma membrane and extracellular release of the intraluminal vesicles. Recent studies have focused on the biogenesis and composition of exosomes as well as regulation of exosome release. Exosomes have been shown to be released by cells of hematopoietic and non-hematopoietic origin, yet their function remains enigmatic. Much of the prior work has focused on exosomes as a source of tumor antigens and in presentation of tumor antigens to T cells. However, new studies have shown that exosomes might also promote cell-to-cell spread of infectious agents. Moreover, exosomes isolated from cells infected with various intracellular pathogens, including Mycobacterium tuberculosis and Toxoplasma gondii, have been shown to contain microbial components and can promote antigen presentation and macrophage activation, suggesting that exosomes may function in immune surveillance. In this review, we summarize our understanding of exosome biogenesis but focus primarily on new insights into exosome function. We also discuss their possible use as disease biomarkers and vaccine candidates.

Exosomes are released by cells as self-contained vesicles with an intact lipid bilayer that encapsulates a small portion of the parent cell. Exosomes have been studied widely as information-rich sources of potential biomarkers that can reveal cellular physiology. We suggest that quantification is essential to understand basic biological relationships between exosomes and their parent cells and hence the underlying interpretation of exosome signals. The number of methods for quantifying exosomes has expanded as interest in exosomes has increased. However, a consensus on proper quantification has not developed, making each study difficult to compare to another. Overcoming this ad hoc approach will require widely available standards that have been adequately characterized, and multiple comparative studies across platforms. We outline the current status of these technical approaches and our view of how they can become more coherent. J. Cell. Physiol. 232: 1587-1590, 2017. © 2016 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

An exosome (30-150 nm size) is a cell-derived vesicle. Exosome-induced regulation in inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) is becoming increasingly popular due to their potential functions of exosomal pathways. Exosomes, which are involved in the regulation of IBD, can be released from various cell types, or found in many physiological fluids, and plants. The specific functions of exosomes in IBD primarily depend on the internal functional components, including RNAs, proteins, and other substances. However, exosome-induced transport mechanisms involving cell-cell communications or cell-environment interactions are also very important. Recent studies have revealed that exosome crosstalk mechanisms may influence major IBD-related pathways, such as immune responses, barrier functions, and intestinal flora. This review highlights the advancements in the biology of exosome secretions and their regulation in IBD. The functional roles of exosomal components, including nucleic acids, proteins, and some other components, are the main focus of this review. More animal and clinical research is needed to study the functions of exosomes on IBD. Designing new drug dosage form using exosome-like-structure may provide new insights into IBD treatment. This review suggests a potential significance for exosomes in IBD diagnosis and treatment.

The RNA exosome is an evolutionarily conserved 3'-5' exoribonucleolytic protein complex involved in processing and degradation of different classes of nuclear and cytoplasmic RNAs, and, therefore, important for the posttranscriptional control of gene expression. Despite the extensive in vivo functional studies and the structural data on the RNA exosome, few studies have been performed on the localization and expression of exosome subunits during gametogenesis, process during which gene expression is largely controlled at the posttranscriptional level. We report the identification of exosome subunits in Lithobates catesbeianus and analysis of the differential subcellular localization of RNA exosome core and catalytic subunits in testis cells. In addition, we show seasonal differences in the expression levels of four exosome subunits in different organs. In addition to being part of the RNA exosome complex, its subunits might participate independently of the complex in the control of gene expression during seasonal variation in bullfrog tissues. These results may be relevant for other eukaryotic species.

CD4(+)CD25(+) regulatory T cells (Tregs) are negative regulators of the immune system that induce and maintain immune tolerance. Exosomes are natural products released from many sources and play a role in antigen presentation, immunoregulation, and signal transduction. In order to determine whether exosomes can be released from Tregs and participate in transplantation tolerance, we isolated and purified Tregs-derived exosomes and established a rat model of kidney transplantation. We then transferred the autologous exosomes into recipients to observe the effect of transplantation tolerance in vivo and in vitro. From in vivo study, serum analysis and histology showed that the function of exosomes can postpone allograft rejection and prolong the survival time of transplanted kidney. From in vitro study, exosomes possessed the capacity to suppress T cells proliferation. Taken together, these results suggest that the Tregs-derived exosomes have a suppressive role on acute rejection and inhibit T cells proliferation, especially exosomes derived from donor-type Tregs, which imply that the Tregs-derived exosomes are one of far-end regulation mechanisms of Tregs. Thus, exosomes released from Tregs could be considered as a possible immunosuppressive reagent for the treatment of transplant rejection.

Exosomes are a subset of extracellular vesicles (EVs) that have important roles in intercellular communication. They contain and carry bioactive molecules within their membranes which are delivered to target cells. Reproducible isolation and enrichment of these exosomes will aid in evaluation of cellular communication. We present an approach that involved the pre-processing of plasma, combined with ultracentrifugation (UC) and size exclusion chromatography (SEC) to isolate EVs and subsequently enrich exosomes. Four variations of this approach (denoted methods I to IV) were compared. Coupling an ultracentrifugation method with size exclusion chromatography (Method II) provided the best yield by nanoparticle tracking analyses (NTA), the presence of the exosomal markers CD63, Flotillin-1 and TSG-101 (immunoblotting) and showed exosome morphology using transmission electron microscopy (TEM). This method provides an efficient way to enrich the exosomes from blood (plasma), which could be potentially employed for clinical diagnostic assessment and therapeutic intervention.

Extracellular vesicles (EVs) are released by cells and can be found in cell culture supernatants and biofluids. EVs carry proteins, nucleic acids, and other cellular components and can deliver these to nearby or distant cells, making EVs of interest as both disease biomarkers and therapeutic targets. EVs in biofluids are heterogeneous, coming from different cell types and from different sources with the cell, which limits the usefulness of bulk EV analysis methods that report the average features of all EVs present. Single-particle measurements such as flow cytometry would be preferred, but the small size and low abundance of surface antigens challenges conventional flow cytometry approaches, leading to the development of vesicle-specific assays and experimental design. Among the key issues that have emerged are: (a) judicious choice of detection (triggering) approach; (b) appropriate control experiments to confirm the vesicular nature of the detected events and the contribution of coincidence (aka swarm detection); and (c) the importance of fluorescence calibration to allow data to be compared over time and between laboratories. We illustrate these issues in the context of fluorescence-triggered Vesicle Flow Cytometry (VFC), a general approach to the quantitative measurement of EV number, size, and surface marker expression.

Exosomes are a subtype of vesicles released by cells of both healthy and neoplastic origin. Preclinical studies suggest a role for tumour-derived exosomes in tumour progression, mainly through the transfer of RNA and proteins from tumour cells to other cells. The transfer of RNA and proteins by tumour-derived exosomes seems to mediate stimulation of angiogenesis and suppression of immune cells; in contrast, exosomes from healthy cells of the immune system appear to have anti-tumour characteristics. Characterisation of the RNA or protein profile of tumour-derived exosomes could have diagnostic or prognostic value, for example, in brain tumours. Anti-tumour therapies could be based on exosomes, for example, by blocking the formation of tumour-derived exosomes or having exosomes release therapeutic agents at specific sites. The most advanced application of this is the use of exosomes from dendritic cells in tumour vaccination; the safety of this has been demonstrated in phase I studies.

Exosomes are small extracellular vesicles released to the extracellular milieu through fusion of multivesicular bodies with the plasma membrane. These vesicles contain microRNAs and might therefore be vehicles transferring genetic information between cells. The aim of this study was to investigate whether there was a sorting of microRNAs into exosomes in the prostate cancer cell line PC-3. In addition, microRNAs in PC-3 cells and in the non-cancerous prostate cell line RWPE-1 were compared. Exosomes were isolated from the conditioned media from PC-3 cells by ultracentrifugation and inspected by electron microscopy. Total RNA was isolated and microRNAs were analyzed by microarray analysis and real time RT-PCR. MicroRNA microarray analysis revealed that the microRNA profile of PC-3 released exosomes was similar to the profile of the corresponding parent cells. Nevertheless, a sorting of certain microRNAs into exosomes was observed, and low number microRNAs (microRNAs with a low number in their name) were found to be underrepresented in these vesicles. Moreover, the miRNA profile of PC-3 cells resembled the miRNA profile of RWPE-1 cells, though some miRNAs were found to be differently expressed in these cell lines. These results show that exosomes from PC-3 cells, in agreement with previous reports from other cell types, contain microRNAs. Furthermore, this study supports the idea that there is a sorting of microRNAs into exosomes and adds a new perspective by pointing at the underrepresentation of low number miRNAs in PC-3 released exosomes.

Exosomes are nano-sized membrane vesicles (50-120 nm), which are released from a wide variety of cells. Depending on their cellular origin, they can induce immune stimulatory-, inhibitory-, or tolerance-inducing effects. However, it is still unclear what role exosomes play during human inflammatory diseases. It has not been studied whether exosomes derived from human dendritic cells (DCs), the first cells to encounter allergens in the mucosa, can carry aeroallergens and contribute to allergic immune responses. We therefore explored whether DC-derived exosomes can present the major cat allergen Fel d 1 and whether they thereby contribute to the pathogenesis of allergic disease. Our results demonstrate that exosomes are able to present aeroallergens and thereby induce T-cell T(H)2-like cytokine production in allergic donors. Thus, these exosomes may be important immune-stimulatory factors in allergic immune responses and important targets or engineered tools in immunotherapy.

Exosomes are extracellular vesicles first described as such 30 years ago and since implicated in cell-cell communication and the transmission of disease states, and explored as a means of drug discovery. Yet fundamental questions about their biology remain unanswered. Here I explore what exosomes are, highlight the difficulties in studying them and explain the current definition and some of the outstanding issues in exosome biology.

Exosomes are a type of cell-derived extracellular nanovesicle. They relay information between cells. Some known exosome functions include immune modulation, promotion of angiogenesis, and tumor metastasis. To date, clinical use of exosomes has focused predominantly on evaluating their efficacy as cancer vaccines or diagnostically as biomarker containers. However, few investigations have explored their potential to serve as a platform for the development of semi-synthetic nanovesicles. Given their nanoscale size, potential to express targeting ligands in native conformations and deformable structure, exosomes offer a logical biological vesicle platform for adapting and producing semi-synthetic vesicles with excellent potential for nanomedicine applications. However, there are obstacles associated with realizing this potential that must be addressed. Thus, a systematic approach to isolating, modifying, and testing exosomes is presented to facilitate the introduction of exosome-based translational nanomedicine.

Exosomes are small vesicles with an average diameter of 100 nm that are produced by many, if not all, cell types. Exosome cargo includes lipids, proteins, and nucleic acids arranged specifically in the endosomes of donor cells. Exosomes can transfer the donor cell components to target cells and can affect cell signaling, proliferation, and differentiation. Important new information about exosomes' remote communication with other cells is rapidly being accumulated. Recent data indicates that the results of this communication depend on the donor cell type and the environment of the host cell. In the field of cancer research, major questions remain, such as whether tumor cell exosomes are equally taken up by cancer cells and normal cells and whether exosomes secreted by normal cells are specifically taken up by other normal cells or also tumor cells. Furthermore, we do not know how exosome uptake is made selective, how we can trace exosome uptake selectivity, or what the most appropriate methods are to study exosome uptake and selectivity. This review will explain the effect of exosome source and the impact of the donor cell growth environment on tumor and normal cell interaction and communication. The review will also summarize the methods that have been used to label and trace exosomes to date.

Exosomes are nanosized membrane particles that are secreted by cells that transmit information from cell to cell. The information within exosomes prominently includes their protein and RNA payloads. Exosomal microRNAs in particular can potently and fundamentally alter the transcriptome of recipient cells. Here we summarize what is known about exosome biogenesis, content, and transmission, with a focus on cardiovascular physiology and pathophysiology. We also highlight some of the questions currently under active investigation regarding these extracellular membrane vesicles and their potential in diagnostic and therapeutic applications.

The exosome is a promising biomarker carrying many kinds of membrane proteins with huge heterogeneity, so the sensitive and multiplex analysis of exosomes is very significant for disease diagnosis and exploration of their biological functions. Herein, we propose an efficient method for highly sensitive detection and heterogeneity identification of exosomes based on the design and fabrication of an aptamer-coated liposome complex coupled with terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase (TdT)-mediated polymerization. Specifically, in the presence of target exosomes, the aptamers immobilized on the surface of 1,2-dioleoyl-3-trimethylammonium-propane liposomes prefer to bind with exosomal membrane proteins due to the high affinity. The resulting aptamer-exosome complex will be accessible to TdT to switch on the polymerization reaction for signal amplification, achieving highly sensitive detection of exosomes. Furthermore, the proposed method can be employed to profile different exosomal membrane proteins by making use of a cluster of corresponding aptamers and obtain a fingerprint map of various cancer cell-derived exosomes. Thus, our approach may provide a highly sensitive and robust strategy for the identification of exosome heterogeneity with advantages of being label-free and having no separation, potentially enabling the precise subpopulation of exosomes with practical value in clinical applications.

Exosomes are small membrane vesicles (30-100nm in diameter) secreted by cells into extracellular space. The present study evaluated the effect of chemotherapeutic agents on exosome production and/or release, and quantified the contribution of exosomes to intercellular drug transfer and pharmacodynamics. Human cancer cells (breast MCF7, breast-to-lung metastatic LM2, ovarian A2780 and OVCAR4) were treated with paclitaxel (PTX, 2-1000nM) or doxorubicin (DOX, 20-1000nM) for 24-48h. Exosomes were isolated from the culture medium of drug-treated donor cells (Donor cells) using ultra-centrifugation, and analyzed for acetylcholinesterase activity, total proteins, drug concentrations, and biological effects (cytotoxicity and anti-migration) on drug-naïve recipient cells (Recipient cells). These results were used to develop computational predictive quantitative pharmacology models. Cells in exponential growth phase released ~220 exosomes/cell in culture medium. PTX and DOX significantly promoted exosome production and/or release in a dose- and time-dependent manner, with greater effects in ovarian cancer cells than in breast cancer cells. Exosomes isolated from Donor cells contained appreciable drug levels (2-7pmole/10<sup>6</sup> cells after 24h treatment with 100-1000nM PTX), and caused cytotoxicity and inhibited migration of Recipient cells. Quantitative pharmacology models that integrated cellular PTX pharmacokinetics with PTX pharmacodynamics successfully predicted effects of exosomes on intercellular drug transfer, cytotoxicity of PTX on Donor cells and cytotoxicity of PTX-containing exosomes on Recipient cells. Additional model simulations indicate that within clinically achievable PTX concentrations, the contribution of exosomes to active drug efflux increased with drug concentration and exceeded the p-glycoprotein efflux when the latter was saturated. Our results indicate (a) chemotherapeutic agents stimulate exosome production or release, and (b) exosome is a mechanism of intercellular drug transfer that contributes to pharmacodynamics of neighboring cells.

Exosomes are nano-sized vesicles of endocytic origin released into the extracellular space upon fusion of multivesicular bodies with the plasma membrane. Exosomes represent a novel mechanism of cell-cell communication allowing direct transfer of proteins, lipids and RNAs. In the nervous system, both glial and neuronal cells secrete exosomes in a way regulated by glutamate. It has been hypothesized that exosomes can be used for interneuronal communication implying that neuronal exosomes should bind to other neurons with some kind of specificity. Here, dissociated hippocampal cells were used to compare the specificity of binding of exosomes secreted by neuroblastoma cells to that of exosomes secreted by cortical neurons. We found that exosomes from neuroblastoma cells bind indiscriminately to neurons and glial cells and could be endocytosed preferentially by glial cells. In contrast, exosomes secreted from stimulated cortical neurons bound to and were endocytosed only by neurons. Thus, our results demonstrate for the first time that exosomes released upon synaptic activation do not bind to glial cells but selectively to other neurons suggesting that they can underlie a novel aspect of interneuronal communication.

Exosomes are extracellular vesicles released upon fusion of multivesicular bodies(MVBs) with the cellular plasma membrane. They originate as intraluminal vesicles (ILVs) during the process of MVB formation. Exosomes were shown to contain selectively sorted functional proteins, lipids, and RNAs, mediating cell-to-cell communications and hence playing a role in the physiology of the healthy and diseased organism. Challenges in the field include the identification of mechanisms sustaining packaging of membrane-bound and soluble material to these vesicles and the understanding of the underlying processes directing MVBs for degradation or fusion with the plasma membrane. The investigation into the formation and roles of exosomes in viral infection is in its early years. Although still controversial, exosomes can, in principle, incorporate any functional factor, provided they have an appropriate sorting signal, and thus are prone to viral exploitation.This review initially focuses on the composition and biogenesis of exosomes. It then explores the regulatory mechanisms underlying their biogenesis. Exosomes are part of the endocytic system,which is tightly regulated and able to respond to several stimuli that lead to alterations in the composition of its sub-compartments. We discuss the current knowledge of how these changes affect exosomal release. We then summarize how different viruses exploit specific proteins of endocytic sub-compartments and speculate that it could interfere with exosome function, although no direct link between viral usage of the endocytic system and exosome release has yet been reported. Many recent reports have ascribed functions to exosomes released from cells infected with a variety of animal viruses, including viral spread, host immunity, and manipulation of the microenvironment, which are discussed. Given the ever-growing roles and importance of exosomes in viral infections, understanding what regulates their composition and levels, and defining their functions will ultimately provide additional insights into the virulence and persistence of infections.

Exosomes are small membrane vesicles that are secreted by a multitude of cell types as a consequence of fusion of multivesicular late endosomes/lysosomes with the plasma membrane. Depending on their origin, exosomes can play roles in different physiological processes. Maturing reticulocytes externalize obsolete membrane proteins such as the transferrin receptor by means of exosomes, whereas activated platelets release exosomes whose function is not yet known. Exosomes are also secreted by cytotoxic T cells, and these might ensure specific and efficient targeting of cytolytic substances to target cells. Antigen presenting cells, such as B lymphocytes and dendritic cells, secrete MHC class-I- and class-II-carrying exosomes that stimulate T cell proliferation in vitro. In addition, dendritic-cell-derived exosomes, when used as a cell-free vaccine, can eradicate established murine tumors. Although the precise physiological target(s) and functions of exosomes remain largely to be resolved, follicular dendritic cells (accessory cells in the germinal centers of secondary lymphoid organs) have recently been shown to bind B-lymphocyte-derived exosomes at their cell surface, which supports the notion that exosomes play an immunoregulatory role. Finally, since exosomes are derived from multivesicular bodies, their molecular composition might provide clues to the mechanism of protein and lipid sorting in endosomes.

Exosomes are nanovesicles originating from late endosomal compartments and secreted by most living cells in ex vivo cell culture conditions. The interest in exosomes was rekindled when B-cell and dendritic cell-derived exosomes were shown to mediate MHC-dependent immune responses. Despite limited understanding of exosome biogenesis and physiological relevance, accumulating evidence points to their bioactivity culminating in clinical applications in cancer. This review focuses on the preclinical studies exploiting the immunogenicity of dendritic cell-derived exosomes (Dex) and will elaborate on the past and future vaccination trials conducted using Dex strategy in melanoma and non-small cell lung cancer patients.

Exosomes are small membrane vesicles, secreted by most cell types from multivesicular endosomes, and thought to play important roles in intercellular communications. Initially described in 1983, as specifically secreted by reticulocytes, exosomes became of interest for immunologists in 1996, when they were proposed to play a role in antigen presentation. More recently, the finding that exosomes carry genetic materials, mRNA and miRNA, has been a major breakthrough in the field, unveiling their capacity to vehicle genetic messages. It is now clear that not only immune cells but probably all cell types are able to secrete exosomes: their range of possible functions expands well beyond immunology to neurobiology, stem cell and tumor biology, and their use in clinical applications as biomarkers or as therapeutic tools is an extensive area of research. Despite intensive efforts to understand their functions, two issues remain to be solved in the future: (i) what are the physiological function(s) of exosomes in vivo and (ii) what are the relative contributions of exosomes and of other secreted membrane vesicles in these proposed functions? Here, we will focus on the current ideas on exosomes and immune responses, but also on their mechanisms of secretion and the use of this knowledge to elucidate the latter issue.

[PMID: 28095652]
Exosomes are small extracellular vesicles (EVs) secreted by many cell types in both normal and pathogenic circumstances. Because EVs, particularly exosomes, are known to transfer biologically active proteins, RNAs and lipids between cells, they have recently become the focus of intense interest as potential mediators of cell-cell communication, particularly in long-range and juxtacrine signaling events associated with adaptive immune function and progression of cancer. Among the EVs, exosomes appear particularly adapted for long-range delivery of cargoes between cells. Because of their association with disease states, the exciting potential for exosomes to serve as diagnostic biomarkers and as target-specific biomolecule delivery vehicles has stimulated a broad range of biomedical investigations to learn how exosomes are generated, what their cargoes are, and how they might be tailored for uptake by remote targets. Addressing these questions requires experimental models in which biochemically useful amounts of material can be harvested, gene expression easily manipulated, and interpretable biological assays developed. The early Xenopus embryo fulfills these model-system ideals in an in vivo context: during morphogenesis the embryo develops several large, fluid-filled extracellular compartments across which numerous tissue-specifying signals must cross, and which are abundantly endowed with exosomes and other EVs. Importantly, certain surface-facing tissues avidly ingest EVs during gastrulation. Recent work has demonstrated that EVs can be isolated from these interstitial spaces in amounts suitable for proteomic and transcriptomic analysis. With its large numbers, great cell size, well-understood fate map, and tolerance of a variety of experimental approaches, the Xenopus embryo provides a unique opportunity to both understand and manipulate the basic cell biology of exosomal trafficking in the context of an intact organism.

Exosomes are small extracellular membrane-based vesicles with a variety of cargoes that are involved in numerous physiological and pathological processes in the nervous system. Accumulating evidence has implicated that exosomes are emerging as a novel form of intercellular communication within the nervous system. In this review, we first illustrate exosome metabolism including its formation, secretion, transport, and uptake. Second, we compare exosomes to synaptic vesicles in terms of intercellular messengers and communicators. Third, we discuss the roles and prospects of exosomes in the diagnosis and treatment of neurodegenerative diseases.

One of the most important protein complexes involved in maintaining correct RNA levels in eukaryotic cells is the exosome, a complex consisting almost exclusively of exoribonucleolytic proteins. Since the identification of the exosome complex, seven years ago, much progress has been made in the characterization of its composition, structure and function in a variety of organisms. Although the exosome seems to accumulate in the nucleolus, it has been clearly established that it is also localized in cytoplasm and nucleoplasm. In accordance with its widespread intracellular distribution, the exosome has been implicated in a variety of RNA processing and degradation processes. Nevertheless, many questions still remain unanswered. What are the factors that regulate the activity of the exosome? How and where is the complex assembled? What are the differences in the composition of the nuclear and cytoplasmic exosome? What is the detailed structure of exosome subunits? What are the mechanisms by which the exosome is recruited to substrate RNAs? Here, we summarize the current knowledge on the composition and architecture of this complex, explain its role in both the production and degradation of various types of RNA molecules and discuss the implications of recent research developments that shed some light on the questions above and the mechanisms that are controlling the exosome.

Exosomes, cell-derived vesicles encompassing lipids, DNA, proteins coding genes and noncoding RNAs (ncRNAs) are present in diverse body fluids. They offer novel biomarker and drug therapy potential for diverse diseases, including cancer. Using gene ontology, exosomal genes database and GeneCards metadata analysis tools, a database of cancer-associated protein coding genes and ncRNAs (n=2,777) was established. Variant analysis, expression profiling and pathway mapping were used to identify putative pancreatic cancer exosomal gene candidates. Five hundred and seventy-five protein-coding genes, 26 RNA genes and one pseudogene directly associated with pancreatic cancer were identified in the study. Nine open reading frames (ORFs) encompassing enzymes, apoptosis and transcriptional regulators, and secreted factors and five cDNAs (enzymes) emerged from the analysis. Among the ncRNA class, 26 microRNAs (miRs), one pseudogene, one long noncoding RNA (LNC) and one antisense gene were identified. Furthermore, 22 exosome-associated protein-coding targets (a cytokine, enzymes, membrane glycoproteins, receptors, and a transporter) emerged as putative leads for pancreatic cancer therapy. Seven of these protein-coding targets are FDA-approved and the drugs-based on these could provide repurposing opportunities for pancreatic cancer. The database of exosomal genes established in this study provides a framework for developing novel biomarkers and drug therapy targets for pancreatic cancer.
