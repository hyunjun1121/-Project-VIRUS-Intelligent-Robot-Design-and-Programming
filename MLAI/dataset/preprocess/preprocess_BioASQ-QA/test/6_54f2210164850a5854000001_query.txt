We report the isolation of a novel antimicrobial peptide, bass hepcidin, from the gill of hybrid striped bass, white bass (Morone chrysops) x striped bass (M. saxatilis). After the intraperitoneal injection of Micrococcus luteus and Escherichia coli, the peptide was purified from HPLC fractions with antimicrobial activity against Escherichia coli. Sequencing by Edman degradation revealed a 21-residue peptide (GCRFCCNCCPNMSGCGVCCRF) with eight putative cysteines. Molecular mass measurements of the native peptide and the reduced and alkylated peptide confirmed the sequence with four intramolecular disulfide bridges. Peptide sequence homology to human hepcidin and other predicted hepcidins, indicated that the peptide is a new member of the hepcidin family. Nucleotide sequences for cDNA and genomic DNA were determined for white bass. A predicted prepropeptide (85 amino acids) consists of three domains: a signal peptide (24 amino acids), prodomain (40 amino acids) and a mature peptide (21 amino acids). The gene has two introns and three exons. A TATA box and several consensus-binding motifs for transcription factors including C/EBP, nuclear factor-kappaB, and hepatocyte nuclear factor were found in the region upstream of the transcriptional start site. In white bass liver, hepcidin gene expression was induced 4500-fold following challenge with the fish pathogen, Streptococcus iniae, while expression levels remained low in all other tissues tested. A novel antimicrobial peptide from the gill, bass hepcidin, is predominantly expressed in the liver and highly inducible by bacterial exposure.

Hepcidin, a 25 amino acid peptide hormone containing a complex network of four disulfide bonds is the hormone regulator of iron homeostasis. Three bridges synthetic peptide analogs have been prepared following two synthetic strategies and two oxidation procedures: i) a microwave-assisted solid phase synthesis followed by air oxidation of the six free cysteines ii) a manual solid phase synthesis followed by stepwise deprotection and oxidation of cysteine pairs. All the peptides with different connectivities have been characterized by MALDI ToF spectrometry, and tested for their ability to degrade the cellular iron exporter, ferroportin. While linear peptides are inactive, the one-bridge and two-bridge peptides retaining protected cysteines by bulky substituents are active. Similarly, the three-bridge peptides are active irrespective of their disulfide connectivities.

Hepcidin, a cysteine-rich cationic antibacterial peptide, plays an important role in human defense against pathogen infection. However, its role in reptile immune response and whether it is involved in antibacterial immune have not yet been proven. In order to study the antibacterial activity of Crocodylus siamensis hepcidin (Cshepc), a common reptile which lives in topic region of Southeast Asia, a cDNA sequence of Cshepc was cloned, which included an open reading frame (ORF) of 300 bp encoding a 99 amino acid preprohepcidin. Cshepc has eight cysteines formed four conserved disulfide bridges, similarly to that of human's. Sequence analysis showed that Cshepc mature peptide was more conserved than that of preprohepcidin. Tissue expression analysis indicated that Cshepc transcripts were highly expressed in the liver, muscle and heart of C. siamensis. Recombinant expressed hepcidin could significantly inhibit the growth of the Gram-negative bacteria Escherichia coli and Aeromonas sobria as well as the Gram-positive bacterium Staphylococcus aureus, and Bacillus subtilis in vitro, suggesting that Cshepc, like human hepcidin could play a role in the antibacterial function in hosts innate immune response.

Hepcidin, a 25-amino-acid peptide secreted by the liver, distributed in the plasma and excreted in urine, is a key central regulator of body iron homeostasis. This hormone decreases export of cellular iron by binding to ferroportin, an iron exporter present at the basolateral surface of enterocytes and macrophages (the sites of dietary iron absorption and iron recycling, respectively), inducing its internalization and degradation. Hepcidin contains eight cysteine residues that form four disulfide bridges, which stabilize a hairpin-shaped structure with two beta sheets. We noticed in the sequence of hepcidin a Cys*-X-Cys* motif which can act as a metal binding site able to trap iron and/or copper. We have tested this hypothesis using a pseudopeptidic synthetic bis-disulfide analogue and we have shown that direct metalation of such ligand leads to the formation of a copper(III) complex with the typical N(2)S(2) donor set. This compound crystallizes in the orthorhombic system, space group Imma. The Cu(III) configuration is square planar, built up from two carboximado-N and two thiolato-S donors. This complex is converted back to the bis-disulfide, with release of the copper salt, upon oxidation with iodine.

Hepcidin was first identified as an antimicrobial peptide present in human serum and urine. It was later demonstrated that hepcidin is the long sought hormone that regulates iron homeostasis in mammals. The native peptide of 25 amino acids (Hepc25) contains four disulfide bridges that maintain a β-hairpin motif. The aim of the present study was to assess whether the intramolecular disulfide bridges are necessary for Hepc25 antimicrobial activity. We show that a synthetic peptide corresponding to human Hepc25, and which contains the four disulfide bridges, has an antibacterial activity against several strains of Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria. On the contrary, a synthetic peptide where all cysteines were replaced by alanines (Hepc25-Ala) had no detectable activity against the same strains of bacteria. In a further step, the mode of action of Hepc25 on Escherichia coli was studied. SYTOX Green uptake was used to assess bacterial membrane integrity. No permeabilization of the membrane was observed with Hepc25, indicating that this peptide does not kill bacteria by destroying their membranes. Gel retardation assay showed that the Hepc25 binds to DNA with high efficiency, and that this binding ability is dependent on the presence of the intramolecular disulfide bridges. Reduction of Hepc25 or replacement of the eight cysteines by alanine residues led to peptides that were no longer able to bind DNA in the in vitro assay. Altogether, these results demonstrate that Hepc25 should adopt a three-dimensional structure stabilized by the intramolecular disulfide bridges in order to have antibacterial activity.

Particularly in the field of middle- and top-down peptide and protein analysis, disulfide bridges can severely hinder fragmentation and thus impede sequence analysis (coverage). Here we present an on-line/electrochemistry/ESI-FTICR-MS approach, which was applied to the analysis of the primary structure of oxytocin, containing one disulfide bridge, and of hepcidin, containing four disulfide bridges. The presented workflow provided up to 80% (on-line) conversion of disulfide bonds in both peptides. With minimal sample preparation, such reduction resulted in a higher number of peptide backbone cleavages upon CID or ETD fragmentation, and thus yielded improved sequence coverage. The cycle times, including electrode recovery, were rapid and, therefore, might very well be coupled with liquid chromatography for protein or peptide separation, which has great potential for high-throughput analysis.
