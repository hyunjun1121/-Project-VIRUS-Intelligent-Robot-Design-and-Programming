IDEAL_ANSWER:
- The influence of membrane-free microcompartments resulting from crowding-induced liquid/liquid phase separation (LLPS) on the dynamic spatial organization of FtsZ, the main component of the bacterial division machinery, has been studied using several LLPS systems.

EXACT_ANSWER:
- membrane-free microcompartments
