Hereditary spastic paraplegias (HSPs) are a heterogeneous group of neurological disorders characterized primarily by a pyramidal syndrome with lower limb spasticity, which can manifest as pure HSP or associated with a number of neurological or non-neurological signs (i.e., complicated HSPs). The clinical variability of HSPs is associated with a wide genetic heterogeneity, with more than eighty causative genes known. Recently, next generation sequencing (NGS) has allowed increasing genetic definition in such a heterogeneous group of disorders. We report on a 56- year-old man affected by sporadic complicated HSP consisting of a pyramidal syndrome, cerebellar ataxia, congenital cataract, pes cavus, axonal sensory-motor peripheral neuropathy and cognitive decline. Brain MRI showed cerebellar atrophy and thin corpus callosum. By NGS we found a novel homozygous biallelic c.452-1G > C mutation in the b-glucosidase 2 gene (GBA2), known to be causative for autosomal recessive hereditary spastic paraplegia type 46 (SPG46). The rarity of this inherited form besides reporting on a novel mutation, expands the genetic and clinical spectrum of SPG46 related HSP.

The non-lysosomal glucosylceramidase GBA2 catalyzes the hydrolysis of glucosylceramide to glucose and ceramide. Loss of GBA2 function results in accumulation of glucosylceramide. Mutations in the human <i>GBA2</i> gene have been associated with hereditary spastic paraplegia (HSP) and autosomal-recessive cerebellar ataxia (ARCA). Patients suffering from these disorders exhibit impaired locomotion and neurological abnormalities. <i>GBA2</i> mutations found in these patients have been proposed to impair GBA2 function. However, the molecular mechanism underlying the occurrence of mutations in the <i>GBA2</i> gene and the development of locomotor dysfunction is not well-understood. In this review, we aim to summarize recent findings regarding mutations in the <i>GBA2</i> gene and their impact on GBA2 function in health and disease.

The <i>GBA2</i> gene encodes the non-lysosomal glucosylceramidase (NLGase), an enzyme that catalyzes the conversion of glucosylceramide (GlcCer) to ceramide and glucose. Mutations in <i>GBA2</i> have been associated with the development of neurological disorders such as autosomal recessive cerebellar ataxia, hereditary spastic paraplegia, and Marinesco-Sjogren-Like Syndrome. Our group has previously identified the <i>GBA2</i> c.1780G>C [p.Asp594His] missense mutation, in a Cypriot consanguineous family with spastic ataxia. In this study, we carried out a biochemical characterization of lymphoblastoid cell lines (LCLs) derived from three patients of this family. We found that the mutation strongly reduce NLGase activity both intracellularly and at the plasma membrane level. Additionally, we observed a two-fold increase of GlcCer content in LCLs derived from patients compared to controls, with the C<sub>16</sub> lipid being the most abundant GlcCer species. Moreover, we showed that there is an apparent compensatory effect between NLGase and the lysosomal glucosylceramidase (GCase), since we found that the activity of GCase was three-fold higher in LCLs derived from patients compared to controls. We conclude that the c.1780G>C mutation results in NLGase loss of function with abolishment of the enzymatic activity and accumulation of GlcCer accompanied by a compensatory increase in GCase.
