Which bacteria causes rat bite fever?

[PMID: 9486709]
Rat-bite fever is an uncommon bacterial illness resulting from infection with Streptobacillus moniliformis that is often transmitted by the bite of a rat. The cutaneous findings in rat-bite fever are nonspecific but have been described as maculopapular or petechial. We describe a 9-year-old girl with acrally distributed hemorrhagic pustules, fever, and arthralgias. Diagnosis was delayed because of difficulty in identifying the pathologic organism. She was successfully treated with 10 days of ceftriaxone.

We report a case of rat-bite fever in a 94-year-old woman with Streptobacillus notomytis infection. We established an epidemiologic link between exposure to rats and human infection by performing nested PCRs that detected S. notomytis in the intraoral swab specimens obtained from rats captured in the patient's house.

Rat bite fever is a bacterial zoonosis transmitted through the bite of rats. One of the two etiological agents that cause rat bite fever is Streptobacillus moniliformis. Rat bite fever is rare and very likely under diagnosed but occurs worldwide. Other animals, like dogs and cats that have mouthed a rat are often mentioned in the literature as potential risks for the attraction of rat bite fever. However, rat bite fever caused by the bite of a dog or cat has very seldom been documented. Therefore, to identify the possible risk for humans to become infected with S. moniliformis after having been bitten by a dog that has been in contact with rats, the presence of S. moniliformis in the mouth of these dogs was tested with molecular methods. Swabs taken from the mouth of 18 dogs with proven contacts with rats were tested for the presence of S. moniliformis DNA by PCR. An amplicon of the right size was obtained in 10 of the 18 dogs. Nucleotide sequencing of five amplicons of PCR positive samples demonstrated the presence of S. moniliformis DNA in the mouth of three dogs. A bite by these dogs therefore might infect humans with S. moniliformis and cause rat bite disease.

Rat bite fever, caused by Streptobacillus moniliformis, is a systemic illness classically characterized by fever, rigors, and polyarthralgias. If left untreated, it carries a mortality rate of 10%. Unfortunately, its nonspecific initial presentation combined with difficulties in culturing its causative organism produces a significant risk of delay or failure in diagnosis. The increasing popularity of rats and other rodents as pets, together with the risk of invasive or fatal disease, demands increased attention to rat bite fever as a potential diagnosis. The clinical and biological features of rat bite fever and Streptobacillus moniliformis are reviewed, providing some distinguishing features to assist the clinician and microbiologist in diagnosis.

We report acute tetraplegia caused by rat bite fever in a 59-year old man (snake keeper) and transmission of Streptobacillus moniliformis. We found an identical characteristic bacterial pattern in rat and human samples, which validated genotyping-based evidence for infection with the same strain, and identified diagnostic difficulties concerning infection with this microorganism.

A 24-year old man presented himself to the emergency ward with complaints of fever, nausea, headache, muscle ache and chest pain. Two weeks before presentation he had been bitten by a pet rat. We determined that he had bacteraemia caused by a Streptobacillus moniliformis infection, which led to the development of an illness called rat bite fever. S. moniliformis is a pleomorphic gram-negative rod-shaped bacterium that is considered part of the normal nasopharyngeal flora in rats. It is the cause of two similar illnesses: rat bite fever and Haverhill fever. Clinicians should consider these infections in the work-up of unexplained fever or sepsis, certainly in the presence of known exposure to rats. Treatment consists of antibiotics.

A 23-year-old black woman was admitted to the hospital in premature labor with intact amniotic membranes. The patient was afebrile and did not have any obvious signs of infection. Gram stain of the amniotic fluid, obtained via transabdominal amniocentesis, revealed the presence of gram-negative rods. The bacterium was identified as Streptobacillus moniliformis, the agent of rat-bite fever.

Rat bite fever is a rare infection typically caused by Streptobacillus moniliformis. The mode of transmission is most commonly through a bite or scratch from an infected rat. This disease is characterized by polyarthritis, fever, and a delayed onset erythematous maculopapular rash of the extremities. The authors report a case of rat bite fever, which led to septic arthritis of the hip. To the authors' knowledge, the complication of hip sepsis requiring an arthrotomy has not been reported in the literature. The orthopaedist should be aware of not only Streptobacillus moniliformis, but also of other zoonotic organisms, which potentially can cause septic arthritis and warrant treatment with specific antibiotics.

Streptobacillus moniliformis is a fastidious growing Gram-negative bacillus responsible of rat-bite fever. We describe here the first report of this disease in la Réunion and the first isolation using shell vial cell culture from a blood culture bottle with a bacterium suspected to be dead.

Streptobacillus moniliformis (Sm), the causative agent of rat-bite fever and Haverhill fever in man, is also a pathogen in certain laboratory and domestic animals. With the introduction of modern maintenance systems, this microorganism seemed to be eradicated from laboratory animal units, but recent reports of Streptobacillus moniliformis (Sm) in colonies of laboratory rodents give evidence that this 'forgotten' bacterium can still be found even behind hygienic barrier systems. Although various national and international recommendations on microbiological screening include Sm, attempts to screen might fail because of insufficient knowledge about this remarkable bacterium. This article highlights these problems. As there is no recent review of Streptobacillus moniliformis, present knowledge of this zoonotic agent is summarized to include: description of the bacterium, its taxonomic position, host spectrum and clinical importance for animals and man, cultivation, diagnosis, antibiotic therapy, risk to laboratory personnel (occupational hazard) and geographical distribution.

Streptobacillus moniliformis is a Gram-negative bacterium found in various laboratory animal species and is the cause of rat bite fever and Haverhill fever in man. In order to evaluate a polymerase chain reaction (PCR) for the detection of this zoonotic bacterium in animal tissues a set of primers was designed based on the DNA base sequence of part of the 16S rRNA gene from 11 S. moniliformis strains. The PCR detected as few as 2-6 copies of S. moniliformis DNA. A 296 bp DNA fragment was amplified from S. moniliformis strains from rodents, humans and turkeys. Amplicons of about the same size were obtained from Fusobacterium necrogenes and Sebaldella (Bacteroides) termitidis but Bfa I treatment of these amplicons did not result in the S. moniliformis specific 130 bp DNA fragment. The in silico evaluation of 14 additional Fusobacterium spp. and 12 unculturable phytoplasmas indicated that none is likely to give rise to confusing amplicons or DNA fragments. The PCR detected S. moniliformis infection in all four orally- and four intravenously-infected C57BL/6 mice and the bacterium was cultured from all but one mouse. The PCR detected S. moniliformis infection in all 12 orally-infected WU rats, and in five of eight rats exposed to natural infection. Enzyme linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) and PCR were equally successful in detecting infection in rats but S. moniliformis was not detected by using culture.

The Leptotrichiaceae are a family of fairly unnoticed bacteria containing both microbiota on mucous membranes as well as significant pathogens such as Streptobacillus moniliformis, the causative organism of streptobacillary rat bite fever. Comprehensive genomic studies in members of this family have so far not been carried out. We aimed to analyze 47 genomes from 20 different member species to illuminate phylogenetic aspects, as well as genomic and discriminatory properties. Our data provide a novel and reliable basis of support for previously established phylogeny from this group and give a deeper insight into characteristics of genome structure and gene functions. Full genome analyses revealed that most S. moniliformis strains under study form a heterogeneous population without any significant clustering. Analysis of infra-species variability for this highly pathogenic rat bite fever organism led to the detection of three specific variable number tandem analysis loci with high discriminatory power. This highly useful and economical tool can be directly employed in clinical samples without laborious prior cultivation. Our and prospective case-specific data can now easily be compared by using a newly established MLVA database in order to gain a better insight into the epidemiology of this presumably under-reported zoonosis.

Rat bite fever due to Streptobacillus moniliformis induces typical but not pathognomonic clinical signs, such as local purulent wound infection followed by maculopapular exanthema, myalgia as well as purulent joint infections. Severe complications, such as osteomyelitis and endocarditis are possible. it seems that this infection is rarely diagnosed but this infection could be much more common because the final diagnostic proof is difficult to achieve. Firstly, the culture of these bacteria is critical because the bacteria are fastidious and secondly the exact differentiation of the isolates is hardly possible by standard laboratory methods. Modern techniques such as mass spectroscopy (MALDI-TOF) and molecular biology allow a precise clarification. Surgical cleansing of infection sites in combination with a rational antibiotic therapy, for example with beta-lactam antibiotics, are generally able to cure the infection if treatment is started early enough. In addition, vaccinations, for example against tetanus and rabies have to be considered in this situation as for all other bite wound infections.
