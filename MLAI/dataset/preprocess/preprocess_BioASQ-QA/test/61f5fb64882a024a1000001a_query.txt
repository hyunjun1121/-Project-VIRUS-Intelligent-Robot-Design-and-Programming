Which disease is treated with Tebentafusp?

[PMID: 32725406]
Uveal melanoma is a distinct subtype of melanoma characterized by a unique biology and divergent response to immune therapies. In this review, we will discuss our current understanding of the pathophysiology of uveal melanoma, systemic treatment options for advanced disease, and potential future therapeutic directions. Although treatment with single-agent checkpoint blockade has been generally disappointing, the results of combined checkpoint blockade are modestly more promising. Several alternative systemic therapeutic approaches have been or are currently being investigated, including two agents that have been taken into registration-intent clinical trials: tebentafusp, a T cell redirecting agent, and IDE196, an oral protein kinase C inhibitor. Treatment of advanced uveal melanoma remains challenging, however, encouraging results from novel agents offer hope for improvement in the near future.

Uveal melanoma is a disease that is distinct from cutaneous melanoma, with a low tumor mutational burden and a 1-year overall survival of approximately 50% in patients with metastatic uveal melanoma. Data showing a proven overall survival benefit with a systemic treatment are lacking. Tebentafusp is a bispecific protein consisting of an affinity-enhanced T-cell receptor fused to an anti-CD3 effector that can redirect T cells to target glycoprotein 100-positive cells. In this open-label, phase 3 trial, we randomly assigned previously untreated HLA-A*02:01-positive patients with metastatic uveal melanoma in a 2:1 ratio to receive tebentafusp (tebentafusp group) or the investigator's choice of therapy with single-agent pembrolizumab, ipilimumab, or dacarbazine (control group), stratified according to the lactate dehydrogenase level. The primary end point was overall survival. A total of 378 patients were randomly assigned to either the tebentafusp group (252 patients) or the control group (126 patients). Overall survival at 1 year was 73% in the tebentafusp group and 59% in the control group (hazard ratio for death, 0.51; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.37 to 0.71; P<0.001) in the intention-to-treat population. Progression-free survival was also significantly higher in the tebentafusp group than in the control group (31% vs. 19% at 6 months; hazard ratio for disease progression or death, 0.73; 95% CI, 0.58 to 0.94; P = 0.01). The most common treatment-related adverse events in the tebentafusp group were cytokine-mediated events (due to T-cell activation) and skin-related events (due to glycoprotein 100-positive melanocytes), including rash (83%), pyrexia (76%), and pruritus (69%). These adverse events decreased in incidence and severity after the first three or four doses and infrequently led to discontinuation of the trial treatment (2%). No treatment-related deaths were reported. Treatment with tebentafusp resulted in longer overall survival than the control therapy among previously untreated patients with metastatic uveal melanoma.

Uveal melanoma is a rare neoplasm with poor prognosis in the metastatic setting. Unlike cutaneous melanoma, treatment with kinase inhibitors or immune checkpoint inhibitors is not effective. Glycoprotein 100 (Gp-100) is a protein highly expressed in melanocytes and melanoma that has recently been effectively targeted by tebentafusp, a first-in-class bispecific protein of the immune-mobilizing monoclonal T cell receptors against cancer (ImmTACs) family. Tebentafusp targets tumor cells that express a peptide of Gp-100 presented by HLA*A0201, creating an immune synapse that kills targeted tumor cells. Recently, a randomized phase III trial reported an overall survival benefit for tebentafusp in patients with untreated metastatic uveal melanoma. The aim of this comprehensive review is to summarize evidence of Gp-100 as a therapeutic target in melanoma, and the preclinical and clinical development of tebentafusp as a novel therapeutic strategy for patients with uveal melanoma.

A bispecific fusion protein designed to redirect T cells toward a melanoma-associated antigen helped prolong survival among patients with an aggressive form of eye cancer. If approved, tebentafusp could become the standard of care for metastatic uveal melanoma-but only for those patients with a particular HLA allele.

Uveal melanoma (UM) is the most common primary intraocular malignancy in adults. UMs are usually initiated by a mutation in GNAQ or GNA11, unlike cutaneous melanomas, which usually harbour a BRAF or NRAS mutation. The annual incidence in Europe and the USA is ~6 per million population per year. Risk factors include fair skin, light-coloured eyes, congenital ocular melanocytosis, ocular melanocytoma and the BAP1-tumour predisposition syndrome. Ocular treatment aims at preserving the eye and useful vision and, if possible, preventing metastases. Enucleation has largely been superseded by various forms of radiotherapy, phototherapy and local tumour resection, often administered in combination. Ocular outcomes are best with small tumours not extending close to the optic disc and/or fovea. Almost 50% of patients develop metastatic disease, which usually involves the liver, and is usually fatal within 1 year. Although UM metastases are less responsive than cutaneous melanoma to chemotherapy or immune checkpoint inhibitors, encouraging results have been reported with partial hepatectomy for solitary metastases, with percutaneous hepatic perfusion with melphalan or with tebentafusp. Better insight into tumour immunology and metabolism may lead to new treatments.

Tebentafusp is a first-in-class bispecific fusion protein designed to target gp100 (a melanoma-associated antigen) through a high affinity T-cell receptor (TCR) binding domain and an anti-CD3 T-cell engaging domain, which redirects T cells to kill gp100-expressing tumor cells. Here, we report a multicenter phase I/II trial of tebentafusp in metastatic melanoma (NCT01211262) focusing on the mechanism of action of tebentafusp. Eighty-four patients with advanced melanoma received tebentafusp. Treatment efficacy, treatment-related adverse events, and biomarker assessments were performed for blood-derived and tumor biopsy samples obtained at baseline and on-treatment. Tebentafusp was generally well-tolerated and active in both patients with metastatic uveal melanoma and patients with metastatic cutaneous melanoma. A 1-year overall survival rate of 65% was achieved for both patient cohorts. On-treatment cytokine measurements were consistent with the induction of IFNγ pathway-related markers in the periphery and tumor. Notably, tebentafusp induced an increase in serum CXCL10 (a T-cell attractant) and a reduction in circulating CXCR3<sup>+</sup> CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells together with an increase in cytotoxic T cells in the tumor microenvironment. Furthermore, increased serum CXCL10 or the appearance of rash (likely due to cytotoxic T cells targeting gp100-expressing skin melanocytes) showed a positive association with patient survival. These data suggest that redirecting T cells using a gp100-targeting TCR/anti-CD3 bispecific fusion protein may provide benefit to patients with metastatic melanoma. Furthermore, the activity observed in these two molecularly disparate melanoma classes hints at the broad therapeutic potential of tebentafusp.
