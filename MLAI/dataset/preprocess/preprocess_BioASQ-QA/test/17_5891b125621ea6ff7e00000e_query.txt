Which disease is treated with taliglucerase alfa?

[PMID: 27102949]
Taliglucerase alfa is the first available plant cell-expressed human recombinant therapeutic protein. It is indicated for treatment of patients with type 1 Gaucher disease (GD) in adult and pediatric patients in several countries. Study PB-06-002 examined the safety and efficacy of taliglucerase alfa for 9 months in patients who previously received imiglucerase. The results of adult patients from Study PB-06-002 who continued receiving taliglucerase alfa in extension Study PB-06-003 for up to 36 months are reported here. Eighteen patients received at least one dose of taliglucerase alfa in Study PB-06-003; 10 patients completed 36 total months of therapy, and four patients who transitioned to commercial drug completed 30-33 months of treatment. In patients who completed 36 total months of treatment, mean percent (±standard error) changes from baseline/time of switch to taliglucerase alfa to 36 months were as follows: hemoglobin concentration, -1.0% (±1.9%; n = 10); platelet count, +9.3% (±9.8%; n = 10); spleen volume measured in multiples of normal (MN), -19.8% (±9.9%; n = 7); liver volume measured in MN, +0.9% (±5.4%; n = 8); chitotriosidase activity, -51.5% (±8.1%; n = 10); and CCL18 concentration, -36.5 (±8.0%; n = 10). Four patients developed antidrug antibodies, including one with evidence of neutralizing activity in vitro. All treatment-related adverse events were mild or moderate and transient. The 36-month results of switching from imiglucerase to taliglucerase alfa treatment in adults with GD provide further data on the clinical safety and efficacy of taliglucerase alfa beyond the initial 9 months of the original study. www.clinicaltrials.gov identifier NCT00705939.

The glycosylation of recombinant β-glucocerebrosidase, and in particular the exposure of mannose residues, has been shown to be a key factor in the success of ERT (enzyme replacement therapy) for the treatment of GD (Gaucher disease). Macrophages, the target cells in GD, internalize β-glucocerebrosidase through MRs (mannose receptors). Three enzymes are commercially available for the treatment of GD by ERT. Taliglucerase alfa, imiglucerase and velaglucerase alfa are each produced in different cell systems and undergo various post-translational or post-production glycosylation modifications to expose their mannose residues. This is the first study in which the glycosylation profiles of the three enzymes are compared, using the same methodology and the effect on functionality and cellular uptake is evaluated. While the major differences in glycosylation profiles reside in the variation of terminal residues and mannose chain length, the enzymatic activity and stability are not affected by these differences. Furthermore, the cellular uptake and in-cell stability in rat and human macrophages are similar. Finally, in vivo studies to evaluate the uptake into target organs also show similar results for all three enzymes. These results indicate that the variations of glycosylation between the three regulatory-approved β-glucocerebrosidase enzymes have no effect on their function or distribution.

Taliglucerase alfa is an intravenous enzyme replacement therapy approved for treatment of type 1 Gaucher disease (GD), and is the first available plant cell-expressed recombinant therapeutic protein. Herein, we report long-term safety and efficacy results of taliglucerase alfa in treatment-naïve adult patients with GD. Patients were randomized to receive taliglucerase alfa 30 or 60 U/kg every other week, and 23 patients completed 36 months of treatment. Taliglucerase alfa (30 U/kg; 60 U/kg, respectively) resulted in mean decreases in spleen volume (50.1%; 64.6%) and liver volume (25.6%; 24.4%) with mean increases in hemoglobin concentration (16.0%; 35.8%) and platelet count (45.7%; 114.0%), and mean decreases in chitotriosidase activity (71.5%; 82.2%). All treatment-related adverse events were mild to moderate in intensity and transient. The most common adverse events were nasopharyngitis, arthralgia, upper respiratory tract infection, headache, pain in extremity, and hypertension. These 36-month results of taliglucerase alfa in treatment-naïve adult patients with GD demonstrate continued improvement in disease parameters with no new safety concerns. These findings extend the taliglucerase alfa clinical safety and efficacy dataset. www.clinicaltrials.gov identifier NCT00705939. Am. J. Hematol. 91:656-660, 2016. © 2016 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

Gaucher disease is inherited as an autosomal recessive disorder. The absence of β-glucocerebrosidase whose purpose is to cleave the glucose from ceramide results in accumulation of glucocerebroside; storage of this glycolipid results in Gaucher disease. There is tremendous clinical heterogeneity: prediction of onset of symptoms (if at all), which organs will be affected, and the degree of severity of the signs and symptoms are areas of current research. Lysosomal storage diseases may be treatable by enzyme replacement therapy. Enzyme replacement for Gaucher disease has been attempted intermittently since the middle 1970s but was not successful until removal of sugars to expose the inner mannose residues allowed the targeting of the enzyme to macrophages via mannose receptors. The use of the recombinant imiglucerase (Cerezyme™) as intravenous therapy has been safe and effective for the visceral symptoms and signs of Gaucher disease in more than 5000 patients world-wide for more than 18 years. Nonetheless, beyond enzymes not being able to traverse the blood-brain barrer, dependence on a single modality is problematic since not all patients are responders, some develop adverse events, and supply may not be forthcoming for non-medical reasons. Thus, the availability of new enzymatic preparations, velaglucerase alfa (VPRIV™) and taliglucerase alfa (UPLYSO™), as well as alternative modalities such as substrate reduction and pharmacological chaperones, are important additions to the management portfolio of this disease.

Gaucher disease (GD) is a rare, genetic lysosomal storage disorder caused by functional defects of acid β-glucosidase that results in multiple organ dysfunction. Glycosylation of recombinant acid human β-glucosidase and exposure of terminal mannose residues are critical to the success of enzyme replacement therapy (ERT) for the treatment of visceral and hematologic manifestations in GD. Three commercially available ERT products for treatment of GD type 1 (GD1) include imiglucerase, velaglucerase alfa, and taliglucerase alfa. Imiglucerase and velaglucerase alfa are produced in different mammalian cell systems and require production glycosylation modifications to expose terminal α-mannose residues, which are needed for mannose receptor-mediated uptake by target macrophages. Such modifications add to production costs. Taliglucerase alfa is a plant cell-expressed acid β-glucosidase approved in the United States and other countries for ERT in adults with GD1. A plant-based expression system, using carrot root cell cultures, was developed for production of taliglucerase alfa and does not require additional processing for postproduction glycosidic modifications. Clinical trials have demonstrated that taliglucerase alfa is efficacious, with a well-established safety profile in adult, ERT-naïve patients with symptomatic GD1, and for such patients previously treated with imiglucerase. These included significant improvements in organomegaly and hematologic parameters as early as 6months, and maintenance of achieved therapeutic values in previously treated patients. Ongoing clinical trials will further characterize the long-term efficacy and safety of taliglucerase alfa in more diverse patient populations, and may help to guide clinical decisions for achieving optimal outcomes for patients with GD1.

Gaucher disease is a rare lysosomal storage disease resulting from a deficiency or reduced activity in the acid β-glucocosidase enzyme. Only 1 treatment option was available for 15 years, but several new treatment options have come to market since 2003. The article will detail the pathophysiology and review current therapies in the literature for all 3 major clinical types of Gaucher disease, with a focus on considerations for selecting therapy in type 1 disease. Extracted and summarized applicable studies and reviews from Cochrane Review, ClinicalTrials.gov, CINAHL, IPA, and PubMed. Enzyme replacement therapy is preferred for the management of Gaucher disease. Current literature does not favor any enzyme replacement product over another. However, velaglucerase alfa and taliglucerase alfa theoretically have a lower risk of immunogenicity reactions compared with imiglucerase. Alternative treatments for type 1 disease include substrate reduction therapy; however, these treatments require evaluation of patient-specific variables (eg, genotype evaluation, renal function) and consideration of adverse effect and dosing profiles. Evaluation of current literature found no substrate reduction therapy is preferred over another. There are no approved therapies for type 2 and type 3 disease, but enzyme replacement therapy may be used with limited efficacy for symptom management. Enzyme replacement therapy is preferred for treating type 1 Gaucher disease and substrate replacement therapy may be considered in patients who do not tolerate or cannot receive enzyme replacement therapy.

Taliglucerase alfa (Protalix Biotherapeutics, Carmiel, Israel) is a novel plant cell-derived recombinant human β-glucocerebrosidase for Gaucher disease. A phase 3, double-blind, randomized, parallel-group, comparison-dose (30 vs 60 U/kg body weight/infusion) multinational clinical trial was undertaken. Institutional review board approvals were received. A 9-month, 20-infusion trial used inclusion/exclusion criteria in treatment-naive adult patients with splenomegaly and thrombocytopenia. Safety end points were drug-related adverse events: Ab formation and hypersensitivity reactions. Primary efficacy end point was reduction in splenic volume measured by magnetic resonance imaging. Secondary end points were: changes in hemoglobin, hepatic volume, and platelet counts. Exploratory parameters included biomarkers and bone imaging. Twenty-nine patients (11 centers) completed the protocol. There were no serious adverse events; drug-related adverse events were mild/moderate and transient. Two patients (6%) developed non-neutralizing IgG Abs; 2 other patients (6%) developed hypersensitivity reactions. Statistically significant spleen reduction was achieved at 9 months: 26.9% (95% confidence interval [CI]: -31.9, -21.8) in the 30-unit dose group and 38.0% (95% CI: -43.4, -32.8) in the 60-unit dose group (both P < .0001); and in all secondary efficacy end point measures, except platelet counts at the lower dose. These results support safety and efficacy of taliglucerase alfa for Gaucher disease.

Taliglucerase alfa, the first available plant cell-expressed recombinant therapeutic protein, is an enzyme replacement therapy approved for Gaucher disease (GD). PB-06-001, a pivotal phase 3, multicenter, randomized, double-blind, parallel-dose study investigated taliglucerase alfa 30 or 60U/kg every other week through 9months in treatment-naïve adults with GD; 30-month extension study PB-06-003 followed. Patients completing PB-06-001 and PB-06-003 could continue treatment in PB-06-007. Nineteen patients enrolled in PB-06-007 (30U/kg, n=8; 60U/kg, n=9; dose adjusted, n=2); 17 completed 5 total years of treatment. In these 3 groups, respectively, taliglucerase alfa resulted in mean decreases in spleen volume (-8.7, -6.9, -12.4 multiples of normal), liver volume (-0.6, -0.4, -0.5 multiples of normal), chitotriosidase activity (-83.1%, -93.4%, -87.9%), and chemokine (CC motif) ligand 18 concentration (-66.7%, -83.3%, -78.9%), as well as mean increases in hemoglobin concentration (+2.1, +2.1, +1.8mg/dL) and platelet count (+31,871, +106,800, +34,000/mm<sup>3</sup>). The most common adverse events were nasopharyngitis and arthralgia. Most adverse events were mild/moderate; no serious adverse events were considered treatment-related. These results demonstrate continued improvement of disease parameters during 5years of taliglucerase alfa therapy in 17 treatment-naive patients with no new safety concerns, extending the taliglucerase alfa clinical efficacy and safety dataset. This study was registered at www.clinicaltrials.gov as NCT01422187.

Taliglucerase alfa is a beta-glucocerebrosidase enzyme replacement therapy approved in the United States, Israel, and other countries for treatment of Type 1 Gaucher disease in adults, and is the first approved plant cell--expressed recombinant protein. In this report, taliglucerase alfa pharmacokinetics were assessed in adult and pediatric patients with Gaucher disease from separate multicenter trials of 30 Units/kg and 60 Units/kg doses infused every 2 weeks. Serial blood samples were obtained from adult patients following single-dose administration on day 1 (n = 26) and multiple doses at week 38 (n = 29), and from pediatric patients following administration of multiple doses of taliglucerase alfa for 10-27 months (n = 10). In both adult and pediatric patients, maximum plasma concentration (Cmax), area under the plasma concentration-time curve from time zero to last measureable concentration (AUC0-t), and from time zero to infinity (AUC0-∞) were higher after 60 Units/kg dose than 30 Units/kg dose. No tendency for accumulation or change in taliglucerase alfa pharmacokinetic parameters over time from day 1 to week 38 was observed with repeated doses of 30 or 60 Units/kg in adults. After multiple doses, mean (range) dose-normalized pharmacokinetic parameters were similar for adult versus pediatric patients receiving 60 Units/kg: Cmax expressed in ng/mL/mg was 42.4 (14.5-95.4) in adults and 46.6 (34.4-68.4) in pediatric patients, AUC0 t expressed in ng • h/mL/mg was 63.4 (26.3-156) in adults and 63.9 (39.8-85.1) in pediatric patients, t1/2 expressed in minutes was 34.8 (11.3-104) in adults and 31.5 (18.0-42.9) in pediatric patients and total body clearance expressed in L/h was 19.9 (6.25-37.9) in adults and 17.0 (11.7-24.9) in pediatric patients. These pharmacokinetic data extend the findings of taliglucerase alfa in adult and pediatric patients. ClinicalTrials.gov. NCT00376168 (in adults); NCT01411228 (in children).

Gaucher disease is an inherited lysosomal storage disorder, characterized by deficient activity of glucocerebrosidase leading to storage of glucocerebroside in tissue macrophages. Type I disease, the most prevalent form, lacks central nervous system involvement but presents primarily with variable degrees of hepatosplenomegaly, cytopenia, and bone disease. Intravenous enzyme replacement therapy can reverse these manifestations. In addition to the two enzymes currently authorized for use, the newest enzyme, taliglucerase alfa, is at the late stages of clinical development. Taliglucerase alfa is a unique product, as it is the first plant cell-based recombinant enzyme therapy. This review considers the existing evidence for therapeutic efficacy of taliglucerase alfa in the treatment of the non-neuronopathic manifestations of Gaucher disease. Clinical studies encompass one phase I trial in healthy volunteers, one phase III trial, and preliminary results from both an extension study and a switch study. In the 9-month, randomized, double-blind phase III trial, treatment-naïve patients with type I Gaucher disease were treated with either 30 or 60 U/kg every 2 weeks. Dose-dependent improvements were achieved after 6 and 9 months of therapy, with reductions in spleen and liver volumes and improvements in hemoglobin levels. Platelet counts improved initially only in the higher-dose group, but preliminary results from the extension study also show significant increases in the lower-dose group. Bone marrow involvement, as assessed by magnetic resonance imaging, improved in almost all patients. Taliglucerase alfa has shown a good safety profile, with few patients experiencing hypersensitivity reactions and developing antibodies. An additional enzyme replacement therapy for Gaucher disease would enable the treatment of more patients and would provide backup for unexpected production problems. Furthermore, it is expected that this new treatment would reduce the costs of therapy. Taliglucerase alfa is a valuable new treatment modality for the non-neuronopathic manifestations of Gaucher disease.

Taliglucerase alfa (Protalix Biotherapeutics, Israel) is a carrot-cell-expressed recombinant human beta-glucocerebrosidase recently approved in the United States for the treatment of type 1 Gaucher disease (GD). As bone disease is one of the most debilitating features of GD, quantification of bone marrow involvement is important for monitoring the response to treatment. Therefore, bone marrow fat fraction (Ff) measured by quantitative chemical shift imaging (QCSI) was included as exploratory parameter to evaluate bone marrow response in treatment naïve GD patients participating in a double-blind, randomized phase III study. Eight GD patients with intact spleens were treated with 30 or 60U/kg biweekly. Ff results were compared to outcomes in 15 untreated Dutch GD patients with a follow-up interval of 1year. Five taliglucerase alfa treated patients had a Ff below the threshold that relates to complication risk (<0.23) at baseline (median (n=8) 0.19, range 0.11-0.35). Ff significantly increased compared to baseline (p=0.012) and compared to untreated patients (p=0.005), already after 1year of follow-up with further improvement up to 36months. In four patients with the lowest Ff, the higher dose resulted in increases above 0.23 within 1year. All patients had sustained improvements in all other parameters. There was no influence of antibodies on response parameters. Treatment with taliglucerase alfa results in significant increases in lumbar spine fat fractions, which indicates clearance of Gaucher cells from the bone marrow.

Taliglucerase alfa is a β-glucosidase enzyme replacement therapy (ERT) approved in the US and other countries for the treatment of Gaucher disease (GD) in adults and is approved in pediatric and adult patients in Australia and Canada. It is the first approved plant cell-expressed recombinant human protein. A Phase 3, multicenter, open-label, 9-month study assessed safety and efficacy of switching to taliglucerase alfa in adult and pediatric patients with GD treated with imiglucerase for at least the previous 2years. Patients with stable disease were offered taliglucerase alfa treatment using the same dose (9-60U/kg body weight) and regimen of administration (every 2weeks) as imiglucerase. This report summarizes results from 26 adult and 5 pediatric patients who participated in the trial. Disease parameters (spleen and liver volumes, hemoglobin concentration, platelet count, and biomarker levels) remained stable through 9months of treatment in adults and children following the switch from imiglucerase. All treatment-related adverse events were mild or moderate in severity and transient in nature. Exploratory parameters of linear growth and development showed positive outcomes in pediatric patients. These findings provide evidence of the efficacy and safety profile of taliglucerase alfa as an ERT for GD in patients previously treated with imiglucerase. This trial was registered at www.clinicaltrials.gov as # NCT00712348.

Taliglucerase alfa is a plant cell-expressed beta-glucocerebrosidase approved in the United States, Israel, Australia, Canada, and other countries for enzyme replacement therapy in adults with Type 1 Gaucher disease (GD), for treatment of pediatric patients in the United States, Australia, and Canada, and for the hematologic manifestations of Type 3 GD in pediatric patients in Canada. This multicenter, randomized, double-blind, parallel-dose, 12-month study assessed efficacy and safety of taliglucerase alfa in pediatric patients with GD. Eleven children were randomized to taliglucerase alfa 30U/kg (n=6) or 60U/kg (n=5) per infusion every other week. From baseline to month 12, the following changes were noted in the taliglucerase alfa 30-U/kg and 60-U/kg dose groups, respectively: median hemoglobin concentrations increased by 12.2% and 14.2%; the interquartile ranges of median percent change in hemoglobin levels from baseline were 20.6 and 10.4, respectively; mean spleen volume decreased from 22.2 to 14.0 multiples of normal (MN) and from 29.4 to 12.9 MN; mean liver volume decreased from 1.8 to 1.5 MN and from 2.2 to 1.7 MN; platelet counts increased by 30.9% and 73.7%; and chitotriosidase activity was reduced by 58.5% and 66.1%. Nearly all adverse events were mild/moderate, unrelated to treatment, and transient. One patient presented with treatment-related gastroenteritis reported as a serious adverse event due to the need for hospitalization for rehydration. No patient discontinued. These data suggest that taliglucerase alfa has the potential to be a therapeutic treatment option for children with GD. This study was registered at www.clinicaltrials.gov as NCT01132690.

Clinical features, complications and treatments of Gaucher's disease (GD), a rare autosomal-recessive disorder due to a confirmed lysosomal enzyme (glucocerebrosidase) deficiency, are described. All patients with known GD, living in France, with ≥ 1 consultations (1980-2010), were included in the French GD registry, yielding the following 4 groups: the entire cohort, with clinical description; and its subgroups: patients with ≥ 1 follow-up visits, to investigate complications; recently followed (2009-2010) patients; and patients treated during 2009-2010, to examine complications before and during treatment. Data are expressed as medians (range) for continuous variables and numbers (%) for categorical variables. Among the 562 registry patients, 265 (49.6%) were females; 454 (85.0%) had type 1, 22 (4.1%) type 2, 37 (6.9%) perinatal-lethal type and 21 (3.9%) type 3. Median ages at first GD symptoms and diagnosis, respectively, were 15 (0-77) and 22 (0-84) years for all types. The first symptom diagnosing GD was splenomegaly and/or thrombocytopenia (37.6% and 26.3%, respectively). Bone-marrow aspiration and/or biopsy yielded the diagnosis for 54.7% of the patients, with enzyme deficiency confirming GD for all patients. Birth incidence rate was estimated at 1/50,000 and prevalence at 1/136,000. For the 378 followed patients, median follow-up was 16.2 (0.1-67.6) years. Major clinical complications were bone events (BE; avascular necrosis, bone infarct or pathological fracture) for 109 patients, splenectomy for 104, and Parkinson's disease for 14; 38 patients died (neurological complications for 15 type-2 and 3 type-3 patients, GD complications for 11 type-1 and another disease for 9 type-1 patients). Forty-six had monoclonal gammopathy. Among 283 recently followed patients, 36 were untreated and 247 had been treated during 2009-2010; 216 patients received treatment in December 2010 (126 with imiglucerase, 45 velaglucerase, 24 taliglucerase, 21 miglustat). BE occurred before (130 in 67 patients) and under treatment (60 in 41 patients) with respective estimated frequencies (95% CI) of first BE at 10 years of 20.3% (14.1%-26.5%) and 19.8% (13.5%-26.1%). This registry enabled the epidemiological description of GD in France and showed that BE occur even during treatment.

Taliglucerase alfa is an enzyme replacement therapy approved for treatment of Gaucher disease (GD) in children and adults in several countries. This multicenter extension study assessed the efficacy and safety of taliglucerase alfa in pediatric patients with GD who were treatment-naïve (n=10) or switched from imiglucerase (n=5). Patients received taliglucerase alfa 30 or 60U/kg (treatment-naïve) or the same dose as previously treated with imiglucerase every other week. In treatment-naïve patients, taliglucerase alfa 30 and 60U/kg, respectively, reduced mean spleen volume (-18.6 multiples of normal [MN] and -26.0MN), liver volume (-0.8MN and -0.9MN), and chitotriosidase activity (-72.7% and -84.4%), and increased mean Hb concentration (+2.0g/dL and +2.3g/dL) and mean platelet count (+38,200/mm<sup>3</sup> and +138,250/mm<sup>3</sup>) from baseline through 36 total months of treatment. In patients previously treated with imiglucerase, these disease parameters remained stable through 33 total months of treatment with taliglucerase alfa. Most adverse events were mild/moderate; treatment was well tolerated. These findings extend the taliglucerase alfa safety and efficacy profile and demonstrate long-term clinical improvement in treatment-naïve children receiving taliglucerase alfa and maintenance of disease stability in children switched to taliglucerase alfa. Treatment was well-tolerated, with no new safety signals. This study is registered at www.clinicaltrials.gov as NCT01411228.

Gaucher disease, a rare disorder, is caused by inherited deficiency of the enzyme glucocerebrosidase. It is unique among the ultra-orphan disorders in that four treatments are currently approved by various regulatory authorities for use in routine clinical practice. Hitherto, because of the relatively few people affected worldwide, many of whom started therapy during a prolonged period when there were essentially no alternatives to imiglucerase, these treatments have not been systematically evaluated in studies such as randomized controlled trials now considered necessary to generate the highest level of clinical evidence. To summarize all available randomized controlled study data on the efficacy and safety of enzyme replacement therapies and substrate reduction therapy for treating Gaucher disease. We searched the Cochrane Cystic Fibrosis and Genetic Disorders Group's Inborn Errors of Metabolism Trials Register. Additional searches were conducted on ClinicalTrials.gov for any ongoing studies with potential interim results, and through PubMed. We also searched the reference lists of relevant articles and reviews.Date of last search: 07 August 2014. All randomized and quasi-randomized controlled studies (including open-label studies and cross-over studies) assessing enzyme replacement therapy or substrate reduction therapy, or both, in all types of Gaucher disease were included. Two authors independently assessed the risk of bias in the included studies, and extracted relevant data. Of the 488 studies retrieved by the electronic searches, eight met the inclusion criteria and were analysed (300 participants). Response parameters were restricted to haemoglobin concentration, platelet count, spleen and liver volume and serum biomarkers (chitotriosidase and CCL18). Only one publication reported a 'low risk of bias' score in all parameters assessed, and all studies included were randomized.Four studies reported the responses to enzyme replacement therapy of previously untreated individuals with type 1 Gaucher disease. Two studies investigated maintenance enzyme replacement therapy in people with stable type 1 Gaucher disease previously treated for at least two years. One study compared substrate reduction therapy, enzyme replacement therapy and a combination thereof as maintenance therapy in people with type 1 Gaucher disease previously treated with enzyme replacement therapy. One study examined substrate reduction therapy in people with chronic neuronopathic (type 3) Gaucher disease who continued to receive enzyme replacement therapy.Treatment-naïve participants had similar increases in haemoglobin when comparing those receiving imiglucerase or alglucerase at 60 units/kg, imiglucerase or velaglucerase alfa at 60 U/kg, taliglucerase alfa at 30 units/kg or 60 units/kg, and velaglucerase alfa at 45 units/g or 60 units/kg. For platelet count response in participants with intact spleens, a benefit for imiglucerase over velaglucerase alfa at 60 units/kg was observed, mean difference -79.87 (95% confidence interval -137.57 to -22.17). There were no other significant differences in platelet count response when comparing different doses of velaglucerase alfa and of taliglucerase alfa, and when comparing imiglucerase to alglucerase. Spleen and liver volume reductions were not significantly different in any enzyme replacement therapy product or dose comparison study. Although a dose effect on serum biomarkers was not seen after nine months, a significantly greater reduction with higher dose was reported after 12 months in the velaglucerase study, mean difference 16.70 (95% confidence intervaI 1.51 to 31.89). In the two enzyme replacement therapy maintenance studies comparing infusions every two weeks and every four weeks, there were no significant differences in haemoglobin concentration, platelet count, and spleen and liver volumes over a 6 to 12 month period when participants were treated with the same cumulative dose.A total of 25 serious adverse events were reported, nearly all deemed unrelated to treatment.There are, as yet, no randomized trials of substrate reduction therapy in treatment-naïve patients that can be evaluated. Miglustat monotherapy appeared as effective as continued enzyme replacement therapy for maintenance of hematological, organ and biomarker responses in people with type 1 Gaucher disease previously treated with imiglucerase for at least two years. In those with neuronopathic Gaucher disease, no significant improvements in haemoglobin concentration, platelet count or organ volumes occurred when enzyme replacement therapy was augmented with miglustat.One randomized controlled study assessing substrate reduction therapy was published immediately prior to producing the final version of this review, and this, along with a further ongoing study (expected to be published in the near future), will be assessed for eligibility in a future update of the review. The results reflect the limitations of analysing evidence restricted to prospective randomized controlled trials, especially when dealing with chronic rare diseases. This analysis suggests that, during the first year of treatment, different recombinant glucocerebrosidases are bio-similar and non-inferior in safety and efficacy for surrogate biological response parameters. Enzyme replacement therapy given at 30 to 45 units/kg body weight every two to four weeks was generally as effective as the 60 unit/kg dose for the assessed clinical outcomes. The analysis emphasise the need to determine whether it is realistic to carry out multi-decade prospective clinical trials for rare diseases such as type 1 Gaucher disease. With large treatment effects on the classical manifestations of the disorder, therapeutic investigations in Gaucher disease mandate innovative trial designs and methodology to secure decisive data concerning long-term efficacy and safety - with the realization that knowledge about disease-modifying actions that are sustained are of crucial importance to people with this chronic condition.

Gaucher's disease is a rare inherited inborn error of metabolism caused by mutations in the gene encoding the lysosomal enzyme glucocerebrosidase, GBA. Glucocerebrosidase is involved in the metabolism of the lipid metabolism-derived substrate, glucocerebroside. Accumulation of glucocerebroside substrate in macrophages, as a result of loss of enzyme function, leads to the formation of Gaucher cells causing hypertrophy of the spleen and liver, hematological disorders, skeletal malformations and the neurological symptoms characteristic of Gaucher's disease. The disease is subdivided into three types that differ in their symptoms, severity and prognosis. Patients of any age can be affected but those of a younger age have a poor prognosis often dying in infancy. As a genetic disorder the incidence of the disease is variable on a global scale. Enzyme replacement therapy is the therapy of choice and has demonstrated good efficacy in treating the visceral and skeletal symptoms of Gaucher's disease. A cost-effective plant-cell-derived human recombinant glucocerebrosidase, taliglucerase alfa, has been developed that demonstrated a promising safety and efficacy profile in phase I clinical trials and is currently in phase III and IV trials for the treatment of pediatric and adult patients with Gaucher's disease.
