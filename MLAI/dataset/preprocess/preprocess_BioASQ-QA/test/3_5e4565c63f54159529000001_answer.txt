IDEAL_ANSWER:
- Liebenberg syndrome (MIM 186550) is a very rare autosomal dominant condition characterized by three main features: dysplasia of all of the bony components of the elbow joint, abnormalities in the shape of carpal bones, and brachydactyly.
- Liebenberg syndrome (MIM 186550) is a very rare autosomal dominant condition characterized by dysplasia of all of the bony components of the elbow joint, abnormalities in the shape of carpal bones, and brachydactyly . It is caused by a deletion upstream to the PITX1 gene resulting in transformation of the upper limbs to reflect lower limb characteristics .
- People who are affected by Liebenberg Syndrome suffer from three main symptoms: Dysplasia (improper formation) of the bony components of the elbow. Abnormal shape of carpal bones. Brachydactyly, a symptom where the fingers and toes are shorter than normal.
- Liebenberg syndrome (MIM 186550) is a very rare autosomal dominant condition . It is characterized by dysplasia of all of the bony components of the elbow joint, abnormalities in the shape of carpal bones, and brachydactyly . We speculate that the area of deletion contains a regulatory sequence that suppresses the expression of PITX1 in the upper limb buds .
- Liebenberg syndrome (MIM 186550) is a very rare autosomal dominant condition characterized by three main features: dysplasia of all of the bony components of the elbow joint, abnormalities in the shape of carpal bones, and brachydactyly

EXACT_ANSWER:
- elbow dysplasia
