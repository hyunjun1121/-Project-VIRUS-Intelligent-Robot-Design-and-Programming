What is the difference between CRISPR-Cas12a and CRISPR-Cpf1?

[PMID: 29189942]
Clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPR)-CRISPR-associated protein (Cas) is a microbial adaptive immune system. CRISPR-Cas systems are classified into two main classes and six types. Cpf1 is a putative type V (class II) CRISPR effector, which has revolutionized the genome editing approaches through multiple distinct features such as using T-rich protospacer-adjacent motif, applying a short guide RNA lacking trans-activating crRNA, introducing a staggered double-strand break, and possessing RNA processing activity in addition to DNA nuclease activity. In the present review, we attempt to highlight most recent advances in CRISPR-Cpf1 (CRISPR-Cas12a) system in particular, considering ground expeditions of the nature and the biology of this system, introducing novel Cpf1 variants that have broadened the versatility and feasibility of CRISPR-Cpf1 system, and lastly the great impact of the CRISPR-Cpf1 system on the manipulation of the genome of prokaryotic, mammalian, and plant models is summarized. With regard to recent developments in utilizing the CRISPR-Cpf1 system in genome editing of various organisms, it can be concluded with confidence that this system is a reliable molecular toolbox of genome editing approaches.
