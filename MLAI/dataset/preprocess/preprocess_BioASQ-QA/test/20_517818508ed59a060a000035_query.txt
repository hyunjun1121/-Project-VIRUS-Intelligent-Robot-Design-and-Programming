Which is the neurodevelopmental disorder associated to mutations in the X- linked gene mecp2?

[PMID: 22670134]
Rett syndrome is one of the most common causes of complex disability in girls. It is characterized by early neurological regression that severely affects motor, cognitive and communication skills, by autonomic dysfunction and often a seizure disorder. It is a monogenic X-linked dominant neurodevelopmental disorder related to mutation in MECP2, which encodes the methyl-CpG-binding protein MeCP2. There are several mouse models either based on conditional knocking out of the Mecp2 gene or on a truncating mutation. We discuss the clinical aspects with special emphasis on the behavioral phenotype and we review current perspectives in clinical management alongside with perspectives in altering gene expression.

Mutations in the methyl-CpG-binding protein 2 gene (MECP2) are identified in the majority of females with Rett syndrome (RTT), an X-linked dominant neurodevelopmental disorder. We searched for mutations by sequencing the MECP2 coding region in 45 sporadic cases (35 with classic RTT, eight with variant forms and two males) and in seven families with two or more affected females. Following our previous report of mutations in two families and eight sporadic cases, we here present 18 additional mutations. We found 13 single nucleotide substitutions, all of which are C-->T transitions at CpG hot spots. Frameshift mutations, leading to premature termination of translation, include two single guanine (G) nucleotide deletions from a stretch of contiguous Gs, a novel four nucleotide deletion, a novel 32 nucleotide deletion in the C-terminal domain and a novel complex duplication/deletion rearrangement in the same region. When X-chromosome inactivation patterns were compared in 16 MECP2 mutation-positive and 23 mutation-negative samples, no significant differences were observed. The mutational spectrum in our subject population is similar to studies from around the world. Of over 300 MECP2 mutations reported, two-thirds are truncating mutations and one-third are missense mutations, mostly in the methyl-binding domain. Nearly 70% of all identified mutations are C-->T transitions at one of eight CpG hot spots, and about 10% are intragenic deletions or complex rearrangements that lead to frameshifts in the C-terminal region. The rate of mutation detection in the MECP2 coding region ranges from 70 to 85% in clinically diagnosed RTT and is much lower in diagnostic variants.

Rett syndrome is an X-linked dominant neurological disorder, which appears to be the commonest genetic cause of profound combined intellectual and physical disability in Caucasian females. Recently, this syndrome has been associated with mutations of the MECP2 gene, a transcriptional repressor of still unknown target genes. Here we report a detailed mutational analysis of 62 patients from UK and Italian archives, representing the first comparative study among different populations and one of the largest number of cases so far analyzed. We review the literature on MECP2 mutations in Rett syndrome. This analysis has permitted us to produce a map of the recurrent mutations identified in this and previous studies. Bioinformatic analysis of the mutations, taking advantage of structural and evolutionary data, leads us to postulate the existence of a new functional domain in the MeCP2 protein, which is conserved among brain-specific regulatory factors.

Rett syndrome (RTT) is a neurodevelopmental disorder caused by mutations in the X-linked methyl CpG binding protein 2 (MeCP2) gene. One hundred sixteen patients with classical and atypical RTT were studied for mutations of the MeCP2 gene by using DHPLC and direct sequencing. Causative mutations in the MeCP2 gene were identified in 63% of patients, representing a total of 30 different mutations. Mutations were identified in 72% of patients with classical RTT and one third of atypical cases studied (8 of 25). The authors found 17 novel mutations, including a complex gene rearrangement found in one individual involving two deletions and a duplication. The duplication was identical to a region within the 3' untranslated region (UTR), and represents the first report of involvement of the 3' UTR in RTT. The authors also report the identification of MeCP2 mutations in two males; a Klinefelter's male with classic RTT (T158M) and a hemizygous male infant with a Xq27-28 inversion and a novel 32 bp frameshift deletion [1154(del32)]. Studies examining the relationship between mutation type, X-inactivation status, and severity of clinical presentation found significant differences in clinical presentation between different types of mutations. Mutations in the amino-terminus were significantly correlated with a more severe clinical presentation compared with mutations closer to the carboxyl-terminus of MeCP2. Skewed X-inactivation patterns were found in two asymptomatic carriers of MeCP2 mutations and six girls diagnosed with either atypical or classical RTT. This patient series confirms the high frequency of MeCP2gene mutations causative of RTT in females and provides data concerning the molecular basis for clinical variability (mutation type and position and X-inactivation patterns).

Rett syndrome (RTT) is a progressive neurodevelopmental disorder that affects almost exclusively girls. Mutations in the X-linked methyl-CpG-binding protein 2 gene (MECP2) have been found to be a cause. In order to study the spectrum of MECP2 mutations in Chinese patients, we employed PCR and sequencing of the coding region of MECP2 gene in 31 Chinese cases of classical sporadic RTT. Mutations in MECP2 were found in about 55%. Twelve different mutations in exon 3 were identified in 17 of these 31 patients; two of these are novel. A novel missense variant was detected in the C-terminal region in a patient and her father who was normal. In addition, there was a single nucleotide variant in the 3'UTR.

Rett syndrome (RS) is a severe neurodevelopmental disorder characterised by normal neurological development followed by progressive developmental regression. The X-linked dominant inheritance of RS has been mapped to the gene that encodes the methyl-CpG-binding protein-2 (MECP2) at Xq28. In the present study, denaturing high-performance liquid chromatography (DHPLC) was used to detect mutations in the MECP2 gene in 20 Malaysian RS patients. Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) was carried out to amplify the MECP2 coding exons 2, 3, and 4 in a total of eight reactions (exons 2, 3a, 3b, 4a, 4b, 4c, 4d and 4e). Subsequently, PCR products were analysed by DHPLC. Mutations in the MECP2 gene were detected in 13 of the 20 (65 percent) RS patients. 11 patients had mutations in exons 3b and 4a and six patients had mutations in exon 4c. These mutations were mainly concentrated in the methyl-CpG-binding domain and the transcriptional-repression domain. Through the use of post-PCR high-performance liquid chromatography, 65 percent of 20 RS patients were found to have mutation(s) in the MECP2.

Rett syndrome is an X-linked dominant neurodevelopmental disorder caused by mutations in the MECP2 gene. Mutations have been demonstrated in more than 80% of females with typical features of Rett syndrome. We identified mutations in the MECP2 gene and documented the clinical manifestations in 65 Rett syndrome patients to characterize the genotype-phenotype spectrum. Bidirectional sequencing of the entire MECP2 coding region was performed. We diagnosed 65 patients with MECP2 mutations. Of these, 15 mutations had been reported previously and 13 are novel. Two patients have multiple deletions within the MECP2 gene. Eight common mutations were found in 43 of 65 patients (66.15%). The majority of patients with identified mutations have the classic Rett phenotype, and several had atypical phenotypes. MECP2 analysis identified mutations in almost all cases of typical Rett syndrome, as well as in some with atypical phenotypes. Eleven (20.4%) of the 54 patients with defined mutations and in whom phenotypic data were obtained did not develop acquired microcephaly. Hence, microcephaly at birth or absence of acquired microcephaly does not obviate the need for MECP2 analysis. We have initiated cascade testing starting with PCR analysis for common mutations followed by sequencing, when necessary. Analysis of common mutations before sequencing the entire gene is anticipated to be the most efficacious strategy to identify Rett syndrome gene mutations.

Rett syndrome is an uncommon neurodevelopmental disorder with an incidence of 1:9,000 live female births. The principal genetic cause was first reported in 1999 when the association with mutations in the methyl-CpG-binding protein 2 (or MECP2) gene was identified. This study uses data from a large international database, InterRett, to examine genotype-phenotype relationships and compares these with previous findings in a population-based cohort. The data set for these analyses was derived from a subset of InterRett cases with subject information collected from the family, the clinician, or both. Individual phenotypic characteristics and clinical severity using three scales were compared among those with eight known recurrent pathogenic MECP2 mutations as well as those with C-terminal deletions (n = 272). Overall, p.R270X and p.R255X were the most severe and p.R133C and p.R294X were the mildest mutations. Significant differences by mutation were seen for individual phenotypic characteristics such as hand use, ambulation, and language. This multicenter investigation into the phenotypic correlates of MECP2 mutations in Rett syndrome has provided a greater depth of understanding than hitherto available about the specific phenotypic characteristics associated with commonly occurring mutations. Although the modifying influence of X inactivation on clinical severity could not be included in the analysis, the findings confirm clear genotype-phenotype relationships in Rett syndrome and show the benefits of collaboration crucial to effective research in rare disorders.

A major challenge for understanding neurodevelopmental disorders, including autism spectrum disorders (ASDs), is to advance the findings from gene discovery to an exposition of neurobiological mechanisms that underlie these disorders and subsequently translate this knowledge into mechanism-based therapeutics. A promising way to proceed is revealed by the recent studies of rare subsets of ASDs. In this review, we summarize the latest advances in the mechanisms and emerging therapeutics for a rare single-gene ASD, Rett syndrome. Rett syndrome is caused by mutations in the gene coding for methyl CpG-binding protein 2 (MeCP2). Although MeCP2 has diverse functions, examination of MeCP2 mutant mice suggests the hypothesis that MeCP2 deficiency leads to aberrant maturation and maintenance of synapses and circuits in multiple brain systems. Some of the deficits arise from alterations in specific intracellular pathways such as the PI3K/Akt signaling pathway. These abnormalities can be at least partially rescued in MeCP2 mutant mice by treatment with therapeutic agents. Mechanism-based therapeutics are emerging for single-gene neurodevelopmental disorders such as Rett syndrome. Given the complexity of MeCP2 function, future directions include combination therapeutics that target multiple molecules and pathways. Such approaches will likely be applicable to other ASDs as well.

Mutations in the MECP2 gene (methyl-CpG-binding protein-2) are responsible for 60-95% of cases of Rett syndrome (RTT), an X-linked dominant neurodevelopmental disorder affecting mostly girls. Classic RTT is characterized by normal early development followed by psychomotor regression and onset of microcephaly, although variant forms are also observed. MECP2 has also been implicated in variable mental retardation (MR) phenotypes, including X-linked Mental Retardation (XLMR), Fragile-X-like Syndrome (FXS) and Angelman-like (AS) phenotypes. The aim of the study was: (a) to evaluate the incidence and spectrum of MECP2 mutations in children with RTT and variant MR; (b) to evaluate phenotype-genotype correlations. Exons 3-4 were analyzed for mutations in 281 MR patients (aged 13 months-27 years old, 144 males-137 females) consisting of 88 patients referred for RTT and 193 patients referred for AS-like and FXS-like types of MR. Statistical analysis included correlation between classic MECP2-positive and MECP2-negative and variant RTT patients, and frequency of MECP2 mutations in the various categories. Mutations were detected in ≈ 70% of classic and ≈ 21% of variant RTT, respectively. Amongst MR cases, 2.1% carried MECP2 mutations. MECP2-positive females had more problems in ambulation, muscle tone, tremor and ataxia, respiratory disturbances, head growth, hand use and stereotypies. Classic RTT-positive versus negative had significant respiratory and sitting problems and versus variant RTT-positive females ambulatory, hand and stereotypies problems. The analysis of the MECP2 gene could provide a diagnostic tool for RTT and non-specific MR research.

Rett syndrome (RTT) is a neurodevelopmental disorder which affects 1/10,000 girls. The aim of this study is to delineate the molecular characteristics of Rett syndrome in China based on the largest group of Chinese patients ever studied. In all, 365 Chinese patients with Rett syndrome were recruited. Clinical information including the family reproductive history was collected through interviewing patients and their parents as well as questionnaires. MECP2, CDKL5, FOXG1 mutational analysis was performed using polymerase chain reaction (PCR), direct sequencing and multiplex ligation-dependent probe amplification (MLPA). The parental origin of mutated MECP2 gene, the MECP2 gene mutation rate in the patients' mothers, and the X-chromosome inactivation pattern of the mothers who carry the mutation were also analyzed. Almost all of the patients were sporadic cases except one pair of twins. The pregnancy loss in probands' mothers and sex ratio of offspring in probands(') generation were available in 352 families and were comparable to the general population. Out of the 365 cases, 315 had MECP2 gene mutations and 3 had de novo CDKL5 gene mutations. No patients had FOXG1 mutation. Among the 315 cases with MECP2 mutations, 274 were typical cases and 41 were atypical cases. All the 3 cases with CDKL5 gene mutations were atypical RTT with early-onset seizures. The analysis of parental origin of mutated MECP2 gene were performed on 139 cases, 90 (64.7%) cases were informative for the study. The result showed 94.4% cases with mutations from paternal origin and 5.6% from maternal origin. Among the cases with paternal mutation, 90.6% had point mutations. C > T was the most common one, accounting for 85.7% of the point mutations. Only one normal phenotype mother (0.41%) carried the same p.R133C mutation of MECP2 gene as her daughter with mild phenotype. The different patterns of X-chromosome inactivation in the mother and the daughter may explain their different phenotypes. The high rate of paternal origin of the mutated MECP2 gene may explain the high occurrence of RTT in female gender. The family cases of RTT are rare and the recurrence risk of RTT is very low in China. Only 0.41% (1/244) mothers carry the pathogenic gene. FOXG1 mutations were not found in this group of Chinese patients.

Rett syndrome (RTT) is a neurodevelopmental disorder characterized by loss of acquired skills after a period of normal development in infant girls. The responsible gene, encoding methyl-CpG binding protein 2 (MeCP2), was recently discovered. Here we explore the spectrum of phenotypes resulting from MECP2 mutations. Both nonsense (R168X and R255X) and missense (R106W and R306C) mutations have been found, with multiple recurrences. R168X mutations were identified in six unrelated sporadic cases, as well as in two affected sisters and their normal mother. The missense mutations were de novo and affect conserved domains of MeCP2. All of the nucleotide substitutions involve C-->T transitions at CpG hotspots. A single nucleotide deletion, at codon 137, that creates a L138X stop codon within the methyl-binding domain was found in an individual with features of RTT and incontinentia pigmenti. An 806delG deletion causing a V288X stop in the transcription-repression domain was identified in a woman with motor-coordination problems, mild learning disability, and skewed X inactivation; in her sister and daughter, who were affected with classic RTT; and in her hemizygous son, who died from congenital encephalopathy. Thus, some males with RTT-causing MECP2 mutations may survive to birth, and female heterozygotes with favorably skewed X-inactivation patterns may have little or no involvement. Therefore, MECP2 mutations are not limited to RTT and may be implicated in a much broader phenotypic spectrum.

To determine if a relationship exists between the clinical features of Rett syndrome, an X-linked dominant neurodevelopmental disorder, and specific mutations in MECP2. Cross-sectional study of 245 girls and women with typical Rett syndrome seen between 1990 and 2004 in tertiary academic outpatient specialty clinics and who had complete MECP2 mutation analysis. A structured clinical evaluation was completed for each participant. The results were grouped by MECP2 mutation and compared. Participants with the R133C mutation are less severely affected than those with R168X or large DNA deletions (p < 0.05). Likewise, individuals with the R168X mutation are more severely affected than those with R294X and late carboxy-terminal truncating mutations (p < 0.05). Clinical differences are notable in ambulation, hand use, and language (p < 0.004), three cardinal features of Rett syndrome. Individuals with R168X are less likely to walk (p = 0.008), retain hand use (p = 0.002), or use words (p = 0.001). In contrast, those with carboxy-terminal truncations are more likely to walk (p = 0.007) and use words (p < 0.001). The R306C mutation, previously found to confer milder features, adversely affects only one clinical feature, language (p < 0.05). Specific mutations in MECP2 confer different severity. These results allow the design of therapies targeted toward the amelioration of expected problems. Furthermore, the distinct effects of MECP2 mutations on clinical severity must be considered in clinical intervention trials.

Mutations in the methyl-CpG-binding protein gene MECP2 at Xq28 cause Rett syndrome (RTT), an X-linked dominant neurodevelopmental disorder characterized by a period of stagnation followed by regression in the development of young girls. Mutations were sought in MECP2 in 48 females with classical sporadic RTT, seven families with possible familial RTT and five sporadic females with features suggestive, but not diagnostic of RTT. Long distance PCR coupled with long-read direct sequencing was employed to sequence the entire MECP2 gene coding region in all cases. Mutations were identified in 44/55 (80%) unrelated classical sporadic and familial RTT patients, but only 1/5 (20%) sporadic cases with suggestive but non-diagnostic features of RTT. Twenty-one different mutations were identified (12 missense, four nonsense and five frame-shift mutations); 14 of these were novel. All missense mutations were located either in the methyl-CpG-binding domain or in the transcription repression domain. Nine recurrent mutations were characterized in a total of 33 unrelated cases (73% of all cases with MECP2 mutations). Significantly milder disease was noted in patients carrying missense mutations as compared with those with truncating mutations ( P = 0. 0023), and milder disease was associated with late as compared with early truncating mutations ( P = 0.0190).

Rett syndrome (RTT) is a progressive neurodevelopmental disorder that is caused by mutations in the X-linked methyl-CpG-binding protein2 (MECP2) gene. In this study, the MECP2 sequences in 121 unrelated Chinese patients with classical or atypical RTT were screened for deletions and mutations. In all, we identified 45 different MECP2 mutations in 102 of these RTT patients. The p. T158M mutation (15.7%) was the most common, followed in order of frequency by p. R168X (11.8%), p. R133C (6.9%), p. R270X (6.9%), p. G269fs (6.9%), p. R255X (4.9%), and p. R306C (3.9%). In addition, we identified five novel MECP2 mutations: three missense (p. K305E, p. V122M, p. A358T), one insertion (c.45-46insGGAGGA), and one 22 bp deletion (c.881-902del22). Large deletions represented 10.5% of all identified MECP2 mutations. Conversely, mutations in exon 1 appeared to be rare (0.9%). The remaining cases without MECP2 mutations were screened for the cyclin-dependent kinase-like 5 (CDKL5) gene using denaturing high-performance liquid chromatography (DHPLC). One synonymous mutation (p. I72I) was found in exon 5, suggesting that CDKL5 is a rare cause of RTT. The overall MECP2 mutation detection rate for this patient series was 84.3:87.9% in 107 classical RTT cases and 57.1% in 14 atypical RTT cases. Moreover, there were two patients with homozygous mutations and normal female karyotypes. However, we did not pinpoint a significant relationship between genotype and phenotype in these cases.

Rett Syndrome (RTT) is an X-linked dominant neurodevelopmental disorder, which almost exclusively affects girls, with an estimated prevalence of one in 10,000-15,000 female births. Mutations in the methyl CpG binding protein 2 gene (MECP2) have been identified in roughly 75% of classical Rett girls. The vast majority of Rett cases (99%) are sporadic in origin, and are due to de novo mutations. We collected DNA samples from 50 Italian classical Rett girls, and screened the MECP2 coding region for mutations by denaturing high-performance liquid chromatography (DHPLC) and subsequent direct sequencing. DHPLC is a recently developed method for mutation screening which identifies heteroduplexes formed in DNA samples containing mismatches between wild type and mutant DNA strands, combining high sensitivity, reduced cost per run, and high throughput. In our series, 19 different de novo MECP2 mutations, eight of which were previously unreported, were found in 35 out of 50 Rett girls (70%). Seven recurrent mutations were characterized in a total of 22 unrelated cases. Initial DHPLC screening allowed the identification of 17 out of 19 different mutations (90%); after optimal conditions were established, this figure increased to 100%, with all recurrent MECP2 mutations generating a characteristic chromatographic profile. Detailed clinical data were available for 27 out of 35 mutation carrying Rett girls. Milder disease was detectable in patients carrying nonsense mutation as compared to patients carrying missense mutations, although this difference was not statistically significant (P = 0.077).

Rett syndrome is an X-linked dominant neurodevelopmental disorder that affects females almost exclusively. The recent identification of mutations of the methyl-CpG-binding protein 2 gene (MECP2) in patients with RTT, encouraged us to analyze the gene in 37 Japanese patients divided into classical RTT (14 cases), variant RTT (13 cases), and mentally retarded patients with Rett-like features (10 cases). Mutations in MECP2 were identified from most of the patients with classical and variant RTT (25 of 27 cases). Six reported common mutations were detected in 17 cases, and rare single nucleotide substitutions were found in 3 patients. In addition, one insertion mutation (1189insA) and four deletion mutations including one double deletion mutant (451delG, 100del4, 1124del53 and 881del289 plus 1187del8) were newly identified. In the 10 mentally retarded patients with Rett-like features, however, no mutation was detected in the coding region of MECP2. The finding of MECP2 mutations in 92.5% of patients with RTT indicates that RTT fulfilling the diagnostic criteria are due to genetic alteration.

Rett syndrome (RTT), an X-linked dominant neurodevelopmental disorder in females, is caused mainly by de novo mutations in the methyl-CpG-binding protein 2 gene (MECP2). Here we report mutation analysis of the MECP2 gene in 87 patients with RTT from the Czech and Slovak Republics, and Ukraine. The patients, all girls, with classical RTT were investigated for mutations using bi-directional DNA sequencing and conformation sensitive gel electrophoresis analysis of the coding sequence and exon/intron boundaries of the MECP2 gene. Restriction fragment length polymorphism analysis was performed to confirm the mutations that cause the creation or abolition of the restriction site. Mutation-negative cases were subsequently examined by multiple ligation-dependent probe amplification (MLPA) to identify large deletions. Mutation screening revealed 31 different mutations in 68 patients and 12 non-pathogenic polymorphisms. Six mutations have not been previously published: two point mutations (323T>A, 904C>T), three deletions (189_190delGA, 816_832del17, 1069delAGC) and one deletion/inversion (1063_1236del174;1189_1231inv43). MLPA analysis revealed large deletions in two patients. The detection rate was 78.16%. Our results confirm the high frequency of MECP2 mutations in females with RTT and provide data concerning the mutation heterogeneity in the Slavic population.

Rett syndrome (RTT) is an X-linked dominant neurodevelopmental disorder affecting 1/10,000-15,000 girls. The disease-causing gene was identified as MECP2 on chromosome Xq28, and mutations have been found in approximately 80% of patients diagnosed with RTT. Numerous mutations have been identified in de novo and rare familial cases, and they occur primarily in the methyl-CpG-binding and transcriptional-repression domains of MeCP2. Our first diagnostic strategy used bidirectional sequencing of the entire MECP2 coding region. Subsequently, we implemented a two-tiered strategy that used denaturing high-performance liquid chromatography (DHPLC) for initial screening of nucleotide variants, followed by confirmatory sequencing analysis. If a definite mutation was not identified, then the entire MECP2 coding region was sequenced, to reduce the risk of false negatives. Collectively, we tested 228 unrelated female patients with a diagnosis of possible (209) or classic (19) RTT and found MECP2 mutations in 83 (40%) of 209 and 16 (84%) of 19 of the patients, respectively. Thirty-two different mutations were identified (8 missense, 9 nonsense, 1 splice site, and 14 frameshifts), of which 12 are novel and 9 recurrent in unrelated patients. Seven unclassified variants and eight polymorphisms were detected in 228 probands. Interestingly, we found that T203M, previously reported as a missense mutation in an autistic patient, is actually a benign polymorphism, according to parental analysis performed in a second case identified in this study. These findings highlight the complexities of missense variant interpretation and emphasize the importance of parental DNA analysis for establishing an etiologic relation between a possible mutation and disease. Overall, we found a 98.8% concordance rate between DHPLC and sequence analyses. One mutation initially missed by the DHPLC screening was identified by sequencing. Modified conditions subsequently enabled its detection, underscoring the need for multiple optimized conditions for DHPLC analysis. We conclude that this two-tiered approach provides a sensitive, robust, and efficient strategy for RTT molecular diagnosis.

Rett syndrome (RTT) is a neurodevelopmental disorder, which almost exclusively affects girls, who, after an initial period of apparently normal development, display gradual loss of speech and purposeful hand use, gait abnormalities and stereotypical hand movements. In the year 2000, mutations in the gene for the methyl CpG binding protein 2, MECP2, have been identified in 35-80% of the patients in three different studies. We have identified 15 different MECP2 mutations in 26 of 30 Danish RTT patients. The mutations included five novel mutations (one point mutation, three smaller deletions involving identical regions in the gene, and one duplication). In contrast to the point mutations and the duplication, which all affect the methyl binding domain or the transcriptional repressing domain, the three overlapping deletions are clustered in the 3' end of the gene. We found no consistent correlation between the type of mutation and the clinical presentation of the patient or the X-inactivation pattern in peripheral blood. Our high mutation detection rate, compared to two of the previous studies, underscores the importance of the inclusion criteria of the patients and supports that MECP2 is the most important, if not the only, gene responsible for RTT.
