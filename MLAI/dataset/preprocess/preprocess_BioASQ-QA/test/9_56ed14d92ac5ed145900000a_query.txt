What is the genetic basis of tuberous sclerosis?

[PMID: 24105488]
Tuberous sclerosis complex is a genetic disorder caused by mutations in either the TSC1 or TSC2 gene that can result in the growth of hamartomas in multiple organ systems. Subependymal giant cell astrocytomas are slow-growing brain tumors associated primarily with tuberous sclerosis complex. They are usually located in the ventricles, often near the foramen of Monro, where they can cause an obstruction if they grow too large, leading to increased intracranial pressure. Surgery to remove a tumor has been the mainstay of treatment but can be associated with postoperative morbidity and mortality. Not all tumors and/or patients are suitable for surgery. The recent development of mammalian target of rapamycin inhibitors that target the pathway affected by TSC1/TSC2 mutations offers a novel pharmacotherapeutic option for these patients. We review the timing and use of surgery versus pharmacotherapy for the treatment of subependymal giant cell astrocytoma in patients with tuberous sclerosis complex.

Fifty years ago, the Eker rat was identified as the first animal model of hereditary renal adenoma and carcinoma, with histopathology resembling human renal carcinoma. Ten years ago, a mutation in the TSC2 gene was identified in the Eker rat at Fox Chase Cancer Center by Yeung and Knudson, and in Tokyo by Kobayashi and Hino. The literature contains dozens of reports of renal cell carcinoma (RCC) in tuberous sclerosis complex (TSC) patients, including tumors in children as young as five and one report in an infant. Despite these facts, the association between TSC and RCC is under-recognized, and sometimes completely omitted from discussions of inherited renal carcinoma. Here, we will review the clinical association of RCC in TSC, consider the factors that have led to its under-emphasis within the RCC field, address the cellular and biochemical mechanisms that may contribute to RCC in cells with TSC1 or TSC2 mutations, and finally discuss the ways in which the TSC signaling pathways may be linked to sporadic RCC in the general population.

Lymphangioleiomyomatosis (LAM) is a progressive and often fatal interstitial lung disease characterized by a diffuse proliferation of abnormal smooth muscle cells in the lungs. LAM is of unusual interest biologically because it affects almost exclusively young women. LAM can occur as an isolated disorder (sporadic LAM) or in association with tuberous sclerosis complex. Renal angiomyolipomas, which are found in most tuberous sclerosis patients, also occur in 60% of sporadic LAM patients. We previously found TSC2 loss of heterozygosity in 7 of 13 (54%) of angiomyolipomas from sporadic LAM patients, suggesting that LAM and TSC could have a common genetic basis. In this study, we report the identification of somatic TSC2 mutations in five of seven angiomyolipomas from sporadic LAM patients. In all four patients from whom lung tissue was available, the same mutation found in the angiomyolipoma was present in the abnormal pulmonary smooth muscle cells. In no case was the mutation present in normal kidney, morphologically normal lung, or lymphoblastoid cells. Our data demonstrate that somatic mutations in the TSC2 gene occur in the angiomyolipomas and pulmonary LAM cells of women with sporadic LAM, strongly supporting a direct role of TSC2 in the pathogenesis of this disease.

Lymphangioleiomyomatosis (LAM) is a cystic lung disease that can be included in the wide group of proliferative lesions named PEComas (perivascular epithelioid cell tumors). These proliferative tumors are characterized by the coexpression of myogenic and melanogenesis-related markers. In all these lesions, genetic alterations related to the tuberous sclerosis complex (TSC) have been demonstrated. Striking improvements in the understanding of the genetic basis of this autosomal dominant genetic disease are coupled to the understanding of the mechanisms that link the loss of TSC1 (9q34) or TSC2 (16p13.3) genes with the regulation of the Rheb/m-TOR/p70S6K pathway. These data have opened a new era in the comprehension of the pathogenesis of LAM and have also suggested new therapeutic strategies for this potentially lethal disease. To present and discuss the pathologic and molecular features of LAM within the spectrum of PEComas, providing a rational approach to their diagnosis. The published literature and personal experience. The inclusion of LAM within the PEComa category is supported by a variety of biologic data and can significantly help in providing a comprehensive view of this interesting and clinically relevant group of lesions. The demonstration of molecular alterations of the mTOR pathway in LAM and other PEComas represents a rational basis for innovative therapeutic approaches with inhibitors of mTOR signaling.

The study of hereditary tumor syndromes has laid a solid foundation toward understanding the genetic basis of cancer. One of the latest examples comes from the study of tuberous sclerosis complex (TSC). As a member of the phakomatoses, TSC is characterized by the appearance of benign tumors, most notably in the central nervous system, kidney, heart, lung, and skin. While classically described as "hamartomas," the pathology of the lesions has features suggestive of abnormal cellular proliferation, size, differentiation, and migration. Occasionally, tumors progress to become malignant (i.e., renal cell carcinoma). The genetic basis of this disease has been attributed to mutations in one of two unlinked genes, TSC1 and TSC2. Cells undergo bi-allelic inactivation of either gene to give rise to tumors in a classic tumor suppressor "two-hit" paradigm. The functions of the TSC1 and TSC2 gene products, hamartin and tuberin, respectively, have remained ill defined until recently. Genetic, biochemical, and biologic analyses have highlighted their role as negative regulators of the mTOR signaling pathway. Tuberin, serving as a substrate of AKT and AMPK, mediates mTOR activity by coordinating inputs from growth factors and energy availability in the control of cell growth, proliferation, and survival. Emerging evidence also suggests that the TSC 1/2 complex may play a role in modulating the activity of beta-catenin and TGFbeta. These findings provide novel functional links between the TSC genes and other tumor suppressors responsible for Cowden's disease (PTEN), Peutz-Jeghers syndrome (LKB1), and familial polyposis (APC). Common sporadic cancers such as prostate, lung, colon, endometrium, and breast have ties to these genes, highlighting the potential role of the TSC proteins in human cancers. Rapamycin, a specific mTOR inhibitor, has potent antitumoral activities in preclinical models of TSC and is currently undergoing phase I/II clinical studies.

Lymphangioleiomyomatosis (LAM) and multifocal micronodular pneumocyte hyperplasia (MMPH) produce cystic and nodular disease, respectively, in the lungs of patients with tuberous sclerosis. The objective of this study was to prospectively characterize the prevalence, clinical presentation, and genetic basis of lung disease in TSC. We performed genotyping and computerized tomographic (CT) scanning of the chest on 23 asymptomatic women with tuberous sclerosis complex (TSC). Cystic pulmonary parenchymal changes consistent with LAM were found in nine patients (39%). These patients tended to be older than cyst-negative patients (31.9 +/- 7.6 yr versus 24.8 +/- 11.6 yr, p = 0.09). There was no correlation between presence of cysts and tobacco use, age at menarche, history of pregnancy, or estrogen-containing medications. Three of the cyst-positive patients had a prior history of pneumothorax. Pulmonary function studies revealed evidence of gas trapping but normal spirometric indices in the cyst-positive group. All nine cyst-positive patients had angiomyolipomas (AML), which were larger (p < 0.05) and more frequently required intervention (p = 0.08) than cyst-negative patients (8 of 14 with AMLs, p < 0.05). Ten patients (43%) had pulmonary parenchymal nodules. Pulmonary nodules were more common in women with cysts (78% versus 21%, p < 0.05), and 52% of all patients had either cystic or nodular changes. TSC2 mutations were identified in all cyst-positive patients who were tested (n = 8), whereas both TSC1 and TSC2 mutations were found in patients with nodular disease. Correlation of the mutational and radiographic data revealed one pair of sisters who were discordant for cystic disease, two mother- daughter pairs who were discordant for nodular disease, and no clear association between cyst development and a specific mutational type. This prospective analysis demonstrates that cystic and nodular pulmonary changes consistent with LAM and MMPH are common in women with TSC.

Tuberous sclerosis is a relatively common inherited disease that causes multiple benign tumours in different organs, frequently leading to skin rashes, seizures and mental handicap. The disease can be caused by mutations in either of two genes, TSC2, identified in 1993, and TSC1, only recently identified. Here we review the current state of knowledge of the molecular genetics of tuberous sclerosis and the spectrum of mutations seen in and the implications of recent findings for patients. Although both genes appear to function as tumour suppressors, the function of their protein products is not understood. A speculative model of how these proteins might function is briefly described.

We have recently identified on rat chromosome 10q a germline mutation in the tuberous sclerosis gene (Tsc2), the gene predisposing to renal carcinoma (RC) in the Eker rat. The homozygous mutant condition is lethal at around the 13th day of fetal life. In heterozygotes, RCs invariably develop in the first year of life. Histologically, RCs develop through multiple stages from early preneoplastic lesions (i.e., phenotypically altered tubules) to adenomas. The wild-type allele mutation has been found even in the earliest preneoplastic lesions, fitting Knudson's two-hit hypothesis and supporting the hypothesis that Tsc2 is a tumor suppressor gene. In this study, homozygous deletion of the Ink4 homologue on rat chromosome 5q was observed in 14 of 24 (58%) RC-derived cell lines. This may represent involvement of a second tumor suppressor gene, contributing to tumor progression. Considering previous results of studies of homozygous deletion of the Ifn alpha gene in five of 24 cases (21%) and the Ifn beta gene in one of 24 cases (4%), the order of the genes may be Ink4-Ifn alpha-Ifn beta. Microsatellite instability was not observed in 26 Eker rat tumors.

Tuberous sclerosis complex is an autosomal dominant disease of benign tumors occurring in multiple organ systems of the body. Either of two genes, TSC1 or TSC2, can be mutated, resulting in the tuberous sclerosis complex phenotype. The protein products of the tuberous sclerosis complex genes, hamartin (TSC1) and tuberin (TSC2), have been discovered to play important roles in several cell-signaling pathways. Knowledge regarding the function of the tuberin-hamartin complex has led to therapeutic intervention trials. Numerous pathogenic mutations have been elucidated in individuals affected with tuberous sclerosis complex. Information on the type and distribution of nearly 1000 mutations in the two genes is discussed. Mosaicism for tuberous sclerosis complex mutations has been documented, complicating provision of genetic counseling to families. Emerging genotype-phenotype correlations should provide guidance for better medical care of individuals with tuberous sclerosis complex.
