Ca(2+) waves are thought to be important in the aetiology of ventricular tachyarrhythmias. There have been conflicting results regarding whether flecainide reduces Ca(2+) waves in isolated cardiomyocytes. We sought to confirm whether flecainide inhibits waves in the intact cardiomyocyte and to elucidate the mechanism. We imaged spontaneous sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR) Ca(2+) release events in healthy adult rat cardiomyocytes. Variation in stimulation frequency was used to produce Ca(2+) sparks or waves. Spark frequency, wave frequency, and wave velocity were reduced by flecainide in the absence of a reduction of SR Ca(2+) content. Inhibition of I(Na) via alternative pharmacological agents (tetrodotoxin, propafenone, or lidocaine) produced similar changes. To assess the contribution of I(Na) to spark and wave production, voltage clamping was used to activate contraction from holding potentials of -80 or -40 mV. This confirmed that reducing Na(+) influx during myocyte stimulation is sufficient to reduce waves and that flecainide only causes Ca(2+) wave reduction when I(Na) is active. It was found that Na(+)/Ca(2+)-exchanger (NCX)-mediated Ca(2+) efflux was significantly enhanced by flecainide and that the effects of flecainide on wave frequency could be reversed by reducing [Na(+)](o), suggesting an important downstream role for NCX function. Flecainide reduces spark and wave frequency in the intact rat cardiomyocyte at therapeutically relevant concentrations but the mechanism involves I(Na) reduction rather than direct ryanodine receptor (RyR2) inhibition. Reduced I(Na) results in increased Ca(2+) efflux via NCX across the sarcolemma, reducing Ca(2+) concentration in the vicinity of the RyR2.

Catecholaminergic polymorphic ventricular tachycardia (CPVT) causes sudden cardiac death due to mutations in cardiac ryanodine receptors (RyR2), calsequestrin, or calmodulin. Flecainide, a class I antiarrhythmic drug, inhibits Na(+) and RyR2 channels and prevents CPVT. The purpose of this study is to identify inhibitory mechanisms of flecainide on RyR2. RyR2 were isolated from sheep heart, incorporated into lipid bilayers, and investigated by single-channel recording under various activating conditions, including the presence of cytoplasmic ATP (2 mM) and a range of cytoplasmic [Ca(2+)], [Mg(2+)], pH, and [caffeine]. Flecainide applied to either the cytoplasmic or luminal sides of the membrane inhibited RyR2 by two distinct modes: 1) a fast block consisting of brief substate and closed events with a mean duration of ∼1 ms, and 2) a slow block consisting of closed events with a mean duration of ∼1 second. Both inhibition modes were alleviated by increasing cytoplasmic pH from 7.4 to 9.5 but were unaffected by luminal pH. The slow block was potentiated in RyR2 channels that had relatively low open probability, whereas the fast block was unaffected by RyR2 activation. These results show that these two modes are independent mechanisms for RyR2 inhibition, both having a cytoplasmic site of action. The slow mode is a closed-channel block, whereas the fast mode blocks RyR2 in the open state. At diastolic cytoplasmic [Ca(2+)] (100 nM), flecainide possesses an additional inhibitory mechanism that reduces RyR2 burst duration. Hence, multiple modes of action underlie RyR2 inhibition by flecainide.

Flecainide is a class 1C antiarrhythmic drug especially used for the management of supraventricular arrhythmia. In overdose cases, flecainide can induce life treating ventricular arrhythmias and cardiogenic shock. We report the case of a 72-year-old woman admitted to our intensive care unit for a regular monomorphic wide complex tachycardia (QRS duration 240 ms, right bundle branch block and superior axis morphology) without apparent P waves. Clinical examination showed slight left congestive heart failure signs without cardiogenic shock. An intravenous bolus of 10 mg adenosine 5'-triphosphate (ATP) was ineffective to stop the tachycardia. The diagnosis of ventricular tachycardia induced by flecainide overdose was considered. 500 mL of intravenous 84‰ sodium bicarbonate was administrated. The patient's QRS narrowed immediately and 12-lead ECG showed sinus rhythm. Blood samples confirmed the flecainide overdose and the clinical status progressively improved.

Flecainide is a class 1c antiarrhythmic that acts by blocking sodium channels to reduce intracardiac conduction and is used mainly in the treatment of supraventricular arrhythmias. Dizziness, visual disturbances, headache, and nausea are commonly associated with flecainide, but severe central nervous system toxicity is rare. Here, we report the case of a 71-year-old woman with a history of renal transplantation who developed severe myoclonus 24 hours after being started on flecainide, 100 mg 2 times a day, because of atrial fibrillation. This symptom completely disappeared once the drug was removed. Only 2 patients presenting with flecainide-induced myoclonus have been previously reported. Although the exact pathophysiologic explanation of this phenomenon remains unclear, it is well known that the susceptibility to severe flecainide toxicity is increased in patients with chronic kidney disease.

Flecainide is recommended as a first-line antiarrhythmic drug to maintain normal sinus rhythm in patients with atrial fibrillation (AF) who have structurally normal hearts or hypertension without left ventricular hypertrophy. Flecainide is a sodium channel blocker with minimal effects expected on ventricular repolarization. We describe the case of a 32-year-old man with a structurally normal heart and persistent AF who was started on diltiazem and flecainide 50 mg twice/day approximately a year prior to presentation. Due to persistent and bothersome symptoms, his dose was increased to 150 mg twice/day, which was associated with a progressive lengthening of his corrected QT interval. On the day of presentation, he underwent an exercise test as part of his job requirements. While running, he felt lightheaded and experienced a syncopal event and cardiac arrest. An automated external defibrillator was available that displayed polymorphic ventricular tachycardia. The patient was successfully resuscitated. Although rare, this case suggests that flecainide can induce QT prolongation leading to torsades de pointes. Clinicians should be aware and consider periodic evaluations with electrocardiograms.

It remains unclear whether flecainide, a Class I antiarrhythmic drug, improves left ventricular pressure gradient (LVPG) or symptoms in patients with obstructive hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM). Our study evaluated the long-term efficacy of flecainide, compared to disopyramide, when administered orally, on LVPG and symptoms in obstructive HCM patients. Among 164 obstructive HCM patients, 15 were administered oral flecainide therapy and 33 administered oral disopyramide therapy. LVPG declined from 79.8 ± 36.6 to 39.2 ± 36.7 mmHg (p = 0.003) after flecainide therapy and from 74.5 ± 26.4 to 31.4 ± 24.8 mmHg (p < 0.001) after disopyramide therapy. The percent reduction in LVPG was -47.9 ± 43.2 % in patients treated with flecainide, comparable to the results for those treated with disopyramide (-57.1 ± 33.0 %; p = 0.425). We found no significant differences in improvement in NYHA functional class between patients treated with flecainide and those treated with disopyramide (p = 0.331). Patients treated with flecainide exhibited no significant adverse side effects, and there was no need for myectomy or alcohol septal ablation to reduce LVPG and symptoms. Improvements in LVPG and symptoms were similar in patients treated with flecainide and patients treated with disopyramide, suggesting that flecainide is a potentially useful alternative for symptomatic obstructive HCM patients, particularly those with disopyramide-induced vagolytic side effects, narrow angle glaucoma, or prostatic hyperplasia and pre-existing urination difficulties. Our data must be viewed with caution, however, in view of the small number of study patients. Flecainide therapy will require further proof of safety before it can be routinely recommended in patients with symptomatic obstructive HCM.

Mechanical stretch has been shown to provoke arrhythmia. We wanted to analyze ventricular arrhythmia induced by local left ventricular stretch in order to find out, where arrhythmias originate and whether they can be prevented pharmacologically. Isolated rabbit hearts (Langendorff technique) were submitted to increased left ventricular stretch at the left wall by insertion of an additional intraventricular balloon and adjusting the end-diastolic pressure (EDP) to 25 mmHg for 10 min followed by 20 min recovery at normal EDP of 5-8 mmHg. Activation and repolarization processes were investigated by ventricular 256 electrode epicardial mapping. The hearts were treated during the whole procedure either with vehicle, 0.5 μM flecainide (sodium channel blocker) or 100 μM streptomycin (here used as stretch-activated ion-channel blocker). In addition, we performed a series of experiments, in which we enhanced EDP to 30 mmHg (global stretch instead of local stretch) by inflating the left ventricular pressure balloon (strain, 0.148 ± 0.034). Each series was performed with n = 6. Stretch resulted in local strain of 25% at the left wall together with a local slowing of the activation process at the left wall, in a change in the activation pattern, and in ventricular arrhythmia. Coronary flow was not affected. Ventricular arrhythmias originated from the border between the stretched area and the non-stretched region. Flecainide and streptomycin reduced the prolongation of the activation process at the stretched left wall and mitigated the difference in total activation time between left and front wall but only partially prevented arrhythmia. In the additional global stretch experiments relative coronary flow and the other parameters remained unchanged, in particular TAT. Thus, in contrast to the local stretch series, there was no difference in the change in TAT between left and front wall. Only rare single ventricular extrasystoles (<1/min; originating from LV (front and left wall) i.e. from within the stretched region) were seen during stretch (but not at the beginning) and during recovery. Local left ventricular stretch can elicit ventricular arrhythmias. Local slowing of electrical activation seems involved so that the difference in total activation time of the stretched free left wall and the non-stretched increased.
