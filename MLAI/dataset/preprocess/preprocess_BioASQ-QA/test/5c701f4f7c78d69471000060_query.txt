Which disease is Dasatinib used to treat?

[PMID: 29515069]
A 37-year-old woman was diagnosed with chronic phase chronic myeloid leukemia. Nilotinib treatment was initiated; however, it had to be discontinued due to an allergic reaction one month later, and dasatinib treatment was provided. Although favorable response was obtained, she started complaining of shortness of breath 7 months after initiating dasatinib treatment. Chest X-ray and echocardiography indicated pulmonary congestion and hypertension. Further, she was diagnosed with mixed connective tissue disease (MCTD) based on Raynaud phenomenon, swollen fingers, sclerodactyly, pancytopenia, hypocomplementemia, and positive anti-U1-RNP antibody. Consequently, dasatinib treatment was discontinued, and she was administered prednisolone (1 mg/kg/day), which was effective and successfully tapered with concomitant administration of cyclophosphamide. This is the first case of MCTD that developed during dasatinib treatment. However, because the present case was a young woman, the development of MCTD could probably be attributed to autoimmune diatheses or it may be a coincidence. However, the possibility of patients receiving dasatinib treatment developing autoimmune diseases needs to be assessed.

The use of imatinib combined with chemotherapy has demonstrated improved outcome in adults with Philadelphia chromosome-positive acute lymphoblastic leukemia (Ph-positive ALL). However, a substantial proportion of patients continue to die as a result of disease progression. We assessed the minimal residual disease (MRD)-based effect and long-term outcome of first-line incorporation of dasatinib (100 mg once daily) into chemotherapy alternatively for adults with Ph-positive ALL. The primary end point was the major molecular response (MMR) rate by the end of the second dasatinib cycle. Patients with a donor proceeded to allogeneic stem cell transplantation (SCT) as early as possible. MRD monitoring was centrally evaluated by real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction (4.5-log sensitivity) using bone marrow samples. Fifty-one patients (median age, 46 years) were enrolled and treated with this strategy. After the first dasatinib cycle, 50 patients (98.0%) achieved complete remission (CR). By the end of the second dasatinib cycle, 46 (93.9%) of 49 assessable patients had persistent CR, and 38 (77.6%) had MMR (32.7%) or undetectable MRD (44.9%). On the basis of the MRD kinetics by this time point, the numbers of early-stable, late, and poor molecular responders were 23 (46.9%), 15 (30.7%), and 11 (22.4%), respectively. Thirty-nine patients (76.5%) underwent allogeneic SCT in CR1. After a median follow-up of 54 months, the 4-year cumulative incidence of relapse and disease-free survival (DFS) rate for all patients were 30.0% and 52.0%, respectively, and the corresponding outcomes among those receiving allogeneic SCT in CR1 were 20.5% and 64.1%, respectively. Poor molecular responders had a higher risk of relapse and DFS than those of early-stable molecular responders. This dasatinib-based protocol was effective for achieving a good quality molecular response and durable DFS in adults with Ph-positive ALL. clinicaltrials.gov, NCT01004497.

To assess the toxicity, tolerance, steroid-sparing capacity, effectiveness, and response rate to imatinib and dasatinib for the treatment of severe sclerotic chronic graft-vs-host disease (scGVHD). This retrospective study analyzed 8 consecutive patients with severe refractory scGVHD who received salvage therapy with imatinib. Patients intolerant and/or refractory to imatinib received dasatinib treatment. 7 patients discontinued imatinib treatment (1 achieved complete response, 5 were resistant and/or intolerant, and 1 developed grade IV neutropenia) and 1 patient achieved prolonged partial response, but died due to an infectious complication while on treatment. 5 patients started dasatinib treatment (3 achieved partial responses and discontinued dasatinib, 1 achieved a durable partial response, but died due to a consecutive rapid pulmonary cGVHD progression and 1 with stable disease discontinued treatment due to gastroenteric intolerance). The response rate (partial and/or complete responses) for severe scGVHD was 25% for imatinib and 60% for dasatinib. In our series, dasatinib was better tolerated, safer, steroid-sparing, and had a low incidence of infectious complications, which suggests that it may be a more effective therapeutic alternative for patients with refractory scGVHD than imatinib. Treatment of scGVHD with effective antifibrotic drugs such as TKI, which block the kinase fibrotic pathway, may be a safe and effective therapeutic option, but further studies are needed to confirm our findings.

Imatinib has improved outcomes in patients with Philadelphia chromosome-positive (Ph+) acute lymphoblastic leukemia (all). Minimal residual disease (mrd) is a useful tool for predicting leukemia relapse. However, there is no consensus on how to treat children with elevation of BCR-ABL transcripts but no evidence of hematologic relapse during chemotherapy combined with imatinib. Here, we report the case of a child with Ph+ all who had persistent elevation of mrd, but no evidence of hematologic relapse while receiving imatinib plus intensive chemotherapy. Dasatinib was substituted for imatinib because no suitable donor for allogeneic hematopoietic stem-cell transplantation (hsct) was available. Less-intensive chemotherapy with methotrexate and 6-mercaptopurine was administered concomitantly. No serious adverse events were encountered. With continuous dasatinib combined with chemotherapy, but no allogeneic hsct, our patient reached complete molecular remission and has been in complete molecular remission for more than 13 months. This report is the first about the long-term use of dasatinib in patients with Ph+ all and mrd elevation but hematologic remission during imatinib chemotherapy. In a similar situation, chemotherapy combined with dasatinib instead of allogeneic hsct could be considered to avoid hsct-related mortality and morbidity. Clinical trials are needed.

Sclerotic chronic graft-versus-host disease (scGVHD) is a severe form of this disease that resembles systemic sclerosis and has limited and disappointing treatment options. Tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKI) targeting up-regulated profibrotic pathways, such as imatinib mesylate, have been proposed as a potential therapeutic approach for patients with scGVHD. Dasatinib, a second-generation TKI with a well-established safety and efficacy profile in chronic myeloid leukemia patients, who are refractory or intolerant to imatinib, has also shown potent antifibrotic effects. We present here the first direct clinical evidence, from 3 patients treated in a small single-center series, suggesting that dasatinib can be a therapeutic option for patients with severe scGVHD resistant or intolerant to imatinib. All patients achieved partial response, with improvement in scGHVD target organs severity, joint mobility, lung impairment, and deep fibrotic lesions. This clinical response has remained stable or continued to improve after a median of 22 months (20-25) on dasatinib treatment, with very good tolerance. In addition, corticosteroids could be discontinued or significantly reduced in all patients. This clinical evidence suggests that dasatinib could be a safe and effective alternative for scGVHD patients refractory to corticosteroids and resistant or intolerant to imatinib. Based on these preliminary findings, and in order to address appropriate patient selection, time of intervention, and choice of drug, future larger studies should more formally establish the efficacy and safety of second-generation TKI for the treatment of scGVHD.

Patients with chronic myeloid leukemia, treated with imatinib, who have a durable complete molecular response, might remain in complete molecular response after stopping treatment. Previous reports of patients stopping treatment in complete molecular response have included only patients with a good response to imatinib. We describe 3 patients with stable complete molecular response on dasatinib treatment following imatinib failure. Two of the 3 patients remain in complete molecular response more than 12 months after stopping dasatinib. In these 2 patients we used highly sensitive patient-specific BCR-ABL1 DNA PCR to show that the leukemic clone remains detectable, as we have previously shown in imatinib-treated patients. Dasatinib-associated immunological phenomena, such as the emergence of clonal T-cell populations, were observed both in one patient who relapsed and in one patient in remission. Our results suggest that the characteristics of complete molecular response on dasatinib treatment may be similar to that achieved with imatinib, at least in patients with adverse disease features.

This study aimed to determine whether the multi-kinase inhibitor dasatinib would provide an effective therapy for myeloproliferative diseases (MPDs) involving c-Cbl mutations. These mutations, which occur in the RING finger and linker domains, abolish the ability of c-Cbl to function as an E3 ubiquitin ligase and downregulate activated protein tyrosine kinases. Here we analyzed the effects of dasatinib in a c-Cbl RING finger mutant mouse that develops an MPD with a phenotype similar to the human MPDs. The mice are characterized by enhanced tyrosine kinase signaling resulting in an expansion of hematopoietic stem cells, multipotent progenitors and cells within the myeloid lineage. Since c-Cbl is a negative regulator of c-Kit and Src signaling we reasoned that dasatinib, which targets these kinases, would be an effective therapy. Furthermore, two recent studies showed dasatinib to be effective in inhibiting the in vitro growth of cells from leukemia patients with c-Cbl RING finger and linker domain mutations. Surprisingly we found that dasatinib did not provide an effective therapy for c-Cbl RING finger mutant mice since it did not suppress any of the hematopoietic lineages that promote MPD development. Thus we conclude that dasatinib may not be an appropriate therapy for leukemia patients with c-Cbl mutations. We did however find that dasatinib caused a marked reduction of pre-B cells and immature B cells which correlated with a loss of Src activity. This study is therefore the first to provide a detailed characterization of in vivo effects of dasatinib in a hematopoietic disorder that is driven by protein tyrosine kinases other than BCR-ABL.

A recent study reported that treatment-free remission (TFR) of chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) after dasatinib (Das) treatment was significantly associated with natural killer (NK) cell proliferation in the peripheral blood. However, biomarkers to predict lymphocytosis or successful TFR are not well characterized. In order to clarify individual differences in NK cell responses among patients treated with Das, we retrospectively analyzed the association between polymorphisms in the natural killer group 2D receptor [NKG2D; also known as killer cell lectin like receptor K1 (KLRK1)] gene and clinical outcomes in 31 patients treated with Das as first-line treatment for CML. Patients with the NKG2D HNK1/HNK1 (high-cytotoxic activity-related allele on NKG2D hb-1) haplotype achieved MR4.5 more quickly than those with other haplotypes [hazard ratio (HR) 4.39; 95% confidence interval (CI) 2.75-118.6; P = 0.004]. In addition, NK cells with the NKG2D HNK1 allele exhibited enhanced phosphorylation of vav guanine nucleotide exchange factor 1 (VAV1) at Tyr174. These data suggest that NKG2D gene polymorphisms may represent candidate biomarkers for the prediction of TFR following Das treatment.

There are no effective treatments or validated clinical response markers in systemic sclerosis (SSc). We assessed imaging biomarkers and performed gene expression profiling in a single-arm open-label clinical trial of tyrosine kinase inhibitor dasatinib in patients with SSc-associated interstitial lung disease (SSc-ILD). Primary objectives were safety and pharmacokinetics. Secondary outcomes included clinical assessments, quantitative high-resolution computed tomography (HRCT) of the chest, serum biomarker assays and skin biopsy-based gene expression subset assignments. Clinical response was defined as decrease of >5 or >20% from baseline in the modified Rodnan Skin Score (MRSS). Pulmonary function was assessed at baseline and day 169. Dasatinib was well-tolerated in 31 patients receiving drug for a median of nine months. No significant changes in clinical assessments or serum biomarkers were seen at six months. By quantitative HRCT, 65% of patients showed no progression of lung fibrosis, and 39% showed no progression of total ILD. Among 12 subjects with available baseline and post-treatment skin biopsies, three were improvers and nine were non-improvers. Improvers mapped to the fibroproliferative or normal-like subsets, while seven out of nine non-improvers were in the inflammatory subset (p = 0.0455). Improvers showed stability in forced vital capacity (FVC) and diffusing capacity for carbon monoxide (DLCO), while both measures showed a decline in non-improvers (p = 0.1289 and p = 0.0195, respectively). Inflammatory gene expression subset was associated with higher baseline HRCT score (p = 0.0556). Non-improvers showed significant increase in lung fibrosis (p = 0.0313). In patients with SSc-ILD dasatinib treatment was associated with acceptable safety profile but no significant clinical efficacy. Patients in the inflammatory gene expression subset showed increase in skin fibrosis, decreasing pulmonary function and worsening lung fibrosis during the study. These findings suggest that target tissue-specific gene expression analyses can help match patients and therapeutic interventions in heterogeneous diseases such as SSc, and quantitative HRCT is useful for assessing clinical outcomes.
