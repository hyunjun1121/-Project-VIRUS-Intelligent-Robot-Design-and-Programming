The nonapeptides arginine vasopressin (AVP; including its non-mammalian homolog arginine vasotocin, AVT) and oxytocin (OT; including its non-mammalian homologs mesotocin, MT, and isotocin, IT) regulate social behavior, including aggression and reproduction, via receptors conserved across vertebrates. In monogamous prairie voles, the vasopressin and oxytocin pathways are crucially important for pair-bond formation, specifically by influencing affiliative behavior toward the mate and aggression toward non-mates. Monogamous social systems are found in diverse taxa. We hypothesized that the AVT/IT pathways are associated with mating behavior in monogamous teleost fishes. We used the monogamous convict cichlid, Amatitlania nigrofasciata, to test this idea. In the first experiment, we treated males with a general nonapeptide receptor antagonist during pair-bond formation. Control males were treated with vehicle. On the first day of treatment we observed a significant reduction in both affiliative behavior toward the potential mate and aggression toward neighbors. However, the antagonist did not prevent the pair-bond from forming and the behavioral effects disappeared on subsequent treatment days. In the second experiment, we administered on three consecutive days the AVP/OT receptor antagonist to males that were in an established pair-bond. In established pairs, male affiliation towards the mate and aggressive behavior towards territorial neighbors were not affected by the antagonist. Our results indicate that the basic social behaviors typically mediated by the AVP/OT pathways may provide the building blocks necessary for monogamous mating behavior.

Oxytocin is a central neuromodulator required for facilitating mate preferences for familiar individuals in a monogamous rodent (prairie vole), irrespective of sex. While the role of oxytocin in mate choice is only understood in a few monogamous species, its function in nonmonogamous species, comprising the vast majority of vertebrate species, remains unclear. To address this issue, we evaluated the involvement of an oxytocin homolog (isotocin, referred herein as oxt) in mate choice in medaka fish (<i>Oryzias latipes</i>). Female medaka prefer to choose familiar mates, whereas male medaka court indiscriminately, irrespective of familiarity. We generated mutants of the oxt ligand (<i>oxt</i>) and receptor genes (<i>oxtr1</i> and <i>oxtr2</i>) and revealed that the oxt-oxtr1 signaling pathway was essential for eliciting female mate preference for familiar males. This pathway was also required for unrestricted and indiscriminate mating strategy in males. That is, either <i>oxt</i> or <i>oxtr1</i> mutation in males decreased the number of courtship displays toward novel females, but not toward familiar females. Further, males with these mutations exhibited enhanced mate-guarding behaviors toward familiar females, but not toward novel females. In addition, RNA-sequencing (seq) analysis revealed that the transcription of genes involved in gamma-amino butyric acid metabolism as well as those encoding ion-transport ATPase are up-regulated in both <i>oxt</i> and <i>oxtr1</i> mutants only in female medaka, potentially explaining the sex difference of the mutant phenotype. Our findings provide genetic evidence that oxt-oxtr1 signaling plays a role in the mate choice for familiar individuals in a sex-specific manner in medaka fish.

Nonapeptides are a highly conserved family of peptides synthesized in the neuroendocrine brain and acting on central and peripheral receptors to regulate physiological functions in vertebrates. While the evolution of the two gene families of oxytocin-like and vasopressin-like nonapeptides and their receptors, as well as the neuroanatomy of their independent neuronal circuits have been well-characterized across vertebrate species, comparative studies on the physiological roles across vertebrates are lagging behind. In the current study, we focused on the comparative neuroendocrine functions and regulation of isotocin, the teleost homologue of mammalian oxytocin. Specifically, we address the hypothesis that isotocin exerts opposing effects on food intake and reproduction, which are well-established effects of its homologue oxytocin in mammalian species. Using goldfish, a well-characterized model of neuroendocrine regulation of both food intake and reproduction, we here showed that isotocin acts as an anorexigenic factor while exerting stimulatory effects on pituitary luteinizing hormone and growth hormone release. Given the dual inhibitory and stimulatory roles of serotonin on food intake and pituitary release of reproductive hormone in goldfish, we also investigated the potential crosstalk between both systems using immunohistochemistry and pharmacological approaches. Results provide neuroanatomical and pharmacological evidence for serotonergic regulation of magnocellular isotocinergic neurons in the preoptic area and pituitary. Together, these findings firstly provide the basis to investigate neuroendocrine cross-talk between serotonergic and nonapeptidergic systems in the regulation of both food intake and reproduction in goldfish, and secondly point to a conserved function of oxytocin-like peptides in the differential neuroendocrine control of both physiological processes in vertebrates.

The mammalian nonapeptide hormones, vasopressin and oxytocin, are known to be potent regulators of social behaviour. Teleost fishes possess vasopressin and oxytocin homologues known as arginine vasotocin (AVT) and isotocin (IT), respectively. The role of these homologous nonapeptides in mediating social behaviour in fishes has received far less attention. The extraordinarily large number of teleost fish species and the impressive diversity of their social systems provide us with a rich test bed for investigating the role of nonapeptides in regulating social behaviour. Existing studies, mostly focused on AVT, have revealed relationships between the nonapeptides, and both social behaviour and dominance status in fishes. To date, much of the work on endogenous nonapeptides in fish brains has measured genomic or neuroanatomical proxies of nonapeptide production rather than the levels of these molecules in the brain. In this study, we measure biologically available AVT and IT levels in the brains of Neolamprologus pulcher, a cooperatively breeding cichlid fish, using high performance liquid chromatography with fluorescence detection. We found that brain AVT levels were higher in the subordinate than in dominant animals, and levels of IT correlated negatively with the expression of affiliative behaviour. We contrast these results with previous studies, and we discuss the role the nonapeptide hormones may play in the regulation of social behaviour in this highly social animal.

The synthesis and release of LH and FSH in the pituitary of vertebrates are differentially regulated during gonadal development and maturation. However, the underlying neuroendocrine mechanisms remain to be fully elucidated. The present study examined the possible involvement of isotocin (Ist), an oxytocin-like neuropeptide, in the regulation of Lh and Fsh in a teleost, the ricefield eel Monopterus albus. The immunoreactive isotocin receptor 2 (Istr2) was shown to be localized to Lh but not Fsh cells. In contrast, immunoreactive isotocin receptor 1 (Istr1) was not observed in either Lh or Fsh cells in the pituitary. Interestingly, Lh cells in female ricefield eels expressed Istr2 and secreted Lh in response to Ist challenge stage-dependently and in correlation with ovarian vitellogenesis. Moreover, Ist decreased Lh contents in the pituitary of female fish, indicating its stimulatory roles on Lh release in vivo. The induction of Lh release by Ist in dispersed pituitary cells was blocked by a PLC or IP3R inhibitor but not by a PKA or PKC inhibitor, indicating the involvement of the IP3/Ca2+ pathway. Collectively, the above results indicate that isotocin may bind to Istr2 to stimulate Lh release via the IP3/Ca2+ pathway, and play important roles in the ovarian maturation in ricefield eels. Furthermore, the present study suggests a novel neuroendocrine mechanism underlying the differential regulation of Lh and Fsh in vertebrates.

A wide range of physiological and behavioral processes, such as social, sexual, and maternal behaviors, learning and memory, and osmotic homeostasis are influenced by the neurohypophysial peptides oxytocin and vasopressin. Disruptions of these hormone systems have been linked to several neurobehavioral disorders, including autism, Prader-Willi syndrome, affective disorders, and obsessive-compulsive disorder. Studies in zebrafish promise to reveal the complex network of regulatory genes and signaling pathways that direct the development of oxytocin- and vasopressin-like neurons, and provide insight into factors involved in brain disorders associated with disruption of these systems. Isotocin, which is homologous to oxytocin, is expressed early, in a simple pattern in the developing zebrafish brain. Single-minded 1 (sim1), a member of the bHLH-PAS family of transcriptional regulatory genes, is required for terminal differentiation of mammalian oxytocin cells and is a master regulator of neurogenesis in Drosophila. Here we show that sim1 is expressed in the zebrafish forebrain and is required for isotocin cell development. The expression pattern of sim1 mRNA in the embryonic forebrain is dynamic and complex, and overlaps with isotocin expression in the preoptic area. We provide evidence that the role of sim1 in zebrafish neuroendocrine cell development is evolutionarily conserved with that of mammals.

The present study using zebrafish as a model explores the role of isotocin, a homolog of oxytocin, in controlling ion regulatory mechanisms. Double-deionized water treatment for 24 h significantly stimulated isotocin mRNA expression in zebrafish embryos. Whole-body Cl(-), Ca(2+), and Na(+) contents, mRNA expressions of ion transporters and ionocyte-differentiation related transcription factors, and the number of skin ionocytes decreased in isotocin morphants. In contrast, overexpression of isotocin caused an increase in ionocyte numbers. Isotocin morpholino caused significant suppression of foxi3a mRNA expression, while isotocin cRNA stimulated foxi3a mRNA expressions at the tail-bud stage of zebrafish embryos. The density of P63 (an epidermal stem cell marker)-positive cells was downregulated by isotocin morpholinos and was upregulated by isotocin cRNA. Taken together, isotocin stimulates the proliferation of epidermal stem cells and differentiation of ionocyte progenitors by regulating the P63 and Foxi3a transcription factors, consequently enhancing the functional activities of ionocytes.

Pro-social effects of oxytocin and its homologues are well-documented in birds and mammals. However, in fishes, the effect of isotocin, the homologue of oxytocin, on social behaviour is less clear. Studies in fishes have generally shown no effect of isotocin on social behaviours or even an anti-social effect. In our study, we measured association preference for conspecifics in 92 adult guppies (46 females and 46 males), half of which were injected with isotocin and the other half with an isotocin antagonist. We found that individuals injected with isotocin spent 29% more time associating with conspecifics than individuals injected with an isotocin antagonist. The effect of isotocin on association time did not differ between males and females. Our study provides some of the first evidence of a pro-social effects of isotocin in a fish and suggests that in fishes, isotocin may have a homologous role to oxytocin, at least in promoting shoaling behaviour.

The mammalian neurohypophysial hormones, vasopressin and oxytocin are involved in osmoregulation and uterine smooth muscle contraction respectively. All jawed vertebrates contain at least one homolog each of vasopressin and oxytocin whereas jawless vertebrates contain a single neurohypophysial hormone called vasotocin. The vasopressin homolog in non-mammalian vertebrates is vasotocin; and the oxytocin homolog is mesotocin in non-eutherian tetrapods, mesotocin and [Phe2]mesotocin in lungfishes, and isotocin in ray-finned fishes. The genes encoding vasopressin and oxytocin genes are closely linked in the human and rodent genomes in a tail-to-tail orientation. In contrast, their pufferfish homologs (vasotocin and isotocin) are located on the same strand of DNA with isotocin gene located upstream of vasotocin gene separated by five genes, suggesting that this locus has experienced rearrangements in either mammalian or ray-finned fish lineage, or in both lineages. The coelacanths occupy a unique phylogenetic position close to the divergence of the mammalian and ray-finned fish lineages. We have sequenced a coelacanth (Latimeria menadoensis) BAC clone encompassing the neurohypophysial hormone genes and investigated the evolutionary history of the vertebrate neurohypophysial hormone gene locus within a comparative genomics framework. The coelacanth contains vasotocin and mesotocin genes like non-mammalian tetrapods. The coelacanth genes are present on the same strand of DNA with no intervening genes, with the vasotocin gene located upstream of the mesotocin gene. Nucleotide sequences of the second exons of the two genes are under purifying selection implying a regulatory function. We have also analyzed the neurohypophysial hormone gene locus in the genomes of opossum, chicken and Xenopus tropicalis. The opossum contains two tandem copies of vasopressin and mesotocin genes. The vasotocin and mesotocin genes in chicken and Xenopus, and the vasopressin and mesotocin genes in opossum are linked tail-to-head similar to their orthologs in coelacanth and unlike their homologs in human and rodents. Our results indicate that the neurohypophysial hormone gene locus has experienced independent rearrangements in both placental mammals and teleost fishes. The coelacanth genome appears to be more stable than mammalian and teleost fish genomes. As such, it serves as a valuable outgroup for studying the evolution of mammalian and teleost fish genomes.
