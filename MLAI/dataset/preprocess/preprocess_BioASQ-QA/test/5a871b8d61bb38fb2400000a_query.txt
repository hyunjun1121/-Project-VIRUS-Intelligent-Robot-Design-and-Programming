Although it has been established that recurrent or prolonged clinical seizures during infancy may cause lifelong brain damage, the underlying molecular mechanism is still not well elucidated. The present study, to the best of our knowledge, is the first to investigate the expression of twenty zinc (Zn)/lipid metabolism‑associated genes in the hippocampus and cerebral cortex of rats following recurrent neonatal seizures. In the current study, 6‑day‑old Sprague‑Dawley rats were randomly divided into control (CONT) and recurrent neonatal seizure (RS) groups. On postnatal day 35 (P35), mossy fiber sprouting and gene expression were assessed by Timm staining and reverse transcription‑quantitative polymerase chain reaction, respectively. Of the twenty genes investigated, seven were significantly downregulated, while four were significantly upregulated in the RS group compared with CONT rats, which was observed in the hippocampus but not in the cerebral cortex. Meanwhile, aberrant mossy fiber sprouting was observed in the supragranular region of the dentate gyrus and Cornu Ammonis 3 subfield of the hippocampus in the RS group. In addition, linear correlation analysis identified significant associations between the expression of certain genes in the hippocampus, which accounted for 40% of the total fifty‑five gene pairs among the eleven regulated genes. However, only eight gene pairs in the cerebral cortex exhibited significant positive associations, which accounted for 14.5% of the total. The results of the present study indicated the importance of hippocampal Zn/lipid metabolism‑associated genes in recurrent neonatal seizure‑induced aberrant mossy fiber sprouting, which may aid the identification of novel potential targets during epileptogenesis.

Mossy cells give rise to the commissural and associational pathway of the dentate gyrus, and receive their major excitatory inputs from the mossy fibers of granule cells. Through these feed-back excitatory connections, mossy cells have been suggested to play important roles in both normal signal processing in learning and memory, as well as in seizure propagation. However, the nature of the activity-dependent modifications of the mossy fiber inputs to mossy hilar cells is not well understood. We studied the long- and short-term plasticity properties of the mossy fiber-mossy cell synapse, using the minimal stimulation technique in slices in whole cell recorded mossy cells retrogradely prelabeled with the fluorescent dye DiO from the contralateral dentate gyrus. Following tetanic stimulation, mossy fiber synapses showed significant NMDA receptor-independent long-term potentiation (LTP), associated with increased excitatory postsynaptic currents (EPSC) amplitude and decreased failure rates. Coefficient of variance and failure rate analyses suggested a presynaptic locus of LTP induction. Mossy fiber synapses on mossy cells also showed activity-dependent short-term modification properties, including both frequency-dependent facilitation (stimuli at higher frequencies evoked larger EPSCs with lower failure rates) and burst facilitation (each EPSC in a burst had a larger amplitude and higher probability of occurrence than the preceding EPSCs within the burst). The data show that mossy fiber-mossy cell synapses exhibit both long- and short-term plasticity phenomena that are generally similar to the mossy fiber synapses on CA3 pyramidal cells.

Granule cells in the dentate gyrus of the hippocampus are thought to be essential to memory function by decorrelating overlapping input patterns (pattern separation). A second excitatory cell type in the dentate gyrus, the mossy cell, forms an intricate circuit with granule cells, CA3c pyramidal cells, and local interneurons, but the influence of mossy cells on dentate function is often overlooked. Multiple tetrode recordings, supported by juxtacellular recording techniques, showed that granule cells fired very sparsely, whereas mossy cells in the hilus fired promiscuously in multiple locations and in multiple environments. The activity patterns of these cell types thus represent different environments through distinct computational mechanisms: sparse coding in granule cells and changes in firing field locations in mossy cells.

Mossy cells in the hilus of the dentate gyrus constitute a major excitatory principal cell type in the mammalian hippocampus; however, it remains unknown how these cells behave in vivo. Here, we have used two-photon Ca<sup>2+</sup> imaging to monitor the activity of mossy cells in awake, behaving mice. We find that mossy cells are significantly more active than dentate granule cells in vivo, exhibit spatial tuning during head-fixed spatial navigation, and undergo robust remapping of their spatial representations in response to contextual manipulation. Our results provide a functional characterization of mossy cells in the behaving animal and demonstrate their active participation in spatial coding and contextual representation.

Recent experimental and modeling results demonstrated that surviving mossy cells in the dentate gyrus play key roles in the generation of network hyperexcitability. Here we examined if mossy cells exhibit long-term plasticity in the posttraumatic, hyperexcitable dentate gyrus. Mossy cells 1 wk after fluid percussion head injury did not show alterations in their current-firing frequency (I-F) and current-membrane voltage (I-V) relationships. In spite of the unchanged I-F and I-V curves, mossy cells showed extensive modifications in Na(+), K(+) and h-currents, indicating the coordinated nature of these opposing modifications. Computational experiments in a realistic large-scale model of the dentate gyrus demonstrated that individually, these perturbations could significantly affect network activity. Synaptic inputs also displayed systematic, opposing modifications. Miniature excitatory postsynaptic current (EPSC) amplitudes were decreased, whereas miniature inhibitory postsynaptic current (IPSC) amplitudes were increased as expected from a homeostatic response to network hyperexcitability. In addition, opposing alterations in miniature and spontaneous synaptic event frequencies and amplitudes were observed for both EPSCs and IPSCs. Despite extensive changes in synaptic inputs, cannabinoid-mediated depolarization-induced suppression of inhibition was not altered in posttraumatic mossy cells. These data demonstrate that many intrinsic and synaptic properties of mossy cells undergo highly specific, long-term alterations after traumatic brain injury. The systematic nature of such extensive and opposing alterations suggests that single-cell properties are significantly influenced by homeostatic mechanisms in hyperexcitable circuits.

Patients with temporal lobe epilepsy often display cognitive comorbidity with recurrent seizures. However, the cellular mechanisms underlying the impairment of neuronal information processing remain poorly understood in temporal lobe epilepsy. Within the hippocampal formation neuronal networks undergo major reorganization, including the sprouting of mossy fibers in the dentate gyrus; they establish aberrant recurrent synapses between dentate granule cells and operate via postsynaptic kainate receptors. In this report, we tested the hypothesis that this aberrant local circuit alters information processing of perforant path inputs constituting the major excitatory afferent pathway from entorhinal cortex to dentate granule cells. Experiments were performed in dentate granule cells from control rats and rats with temporal lobe epilepsy induced by pilocarpine hydrochloride treatment. Neurons were recorded in patch clamp in whole cell configuration in hippocampal slices. Our present data revealed that an aberrant readout of synaptic inputs by kainate receptors triggered a long-lasting impairment of the perforant path input-output operation in epileptic dentate granule cells. We demonstrated that this is due to the aberrant activity-dependent potentiation of the persistent sodium current altering intrinsic firing properties of dentate granule cells. We propose that this aberrant activity-dependent intrinsic plasticity, which lastingly impairs the information processing of cortical inputs in dentate gyrus, may participate in hippocampal-related cognitive deficits, such as those reported in patients with epilepsy.
