What is a foam cell?

[PMID: 31945610]
Oxidative stress, inflammation, and foam cell formation in vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMCs) are considered to play crucial roles in the pathogenesis of atherosclerosis. Poria cocos polysaccharides (PCP) has been shown to possess anti-inflammatory, antitumor and anti-oxidative properties. In this study we explored the effects of PCP on ox-LDL-induced inflammation, oxidative stress and foam cell formation in VSMCs. PCP significantly attenuated ox-LDL-induced oxidative stress, as evidenced by the decreased reactive oxygen species (ROS) and MDA levels, and the increased SOD activity in VSMCs. PCP suppressed the induction effect of ox-LDL on inflammatory cytokines and inflammatory mediators. PCP also substantially inhibited VSMCs foam cell formation and intracellular lipids accumulation. Mechanistically, PCP suppressed ox-LDL-induced up-regulation of LOX-1, which is responsible for ox-LDL uptake. Western blotting suggested that PCP activated ERK1/2 signaling pathway, increased Nrf2 translocated from cytoplasm to nucleus and heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1) expression. Up-regulation of PCP on Nrf2/HO-1 signaling was reversed by pretreatment with ERK inhibitor PD98059, indicating the involvement of ERK in PCP activation of Nrf2/HO-1 signaling. In conclusion, these results demonstrated that PCP exerted its protection against oxidative stress and inflammation via the ERK/Nrf2/HO-1 signaling pathway and that PCP may be a promising candidate for the therapy of atherosclerosis.

<b>Background and Purpose</b>: Atherosclerosis is an underlying cause of coronary heart disease. Foam cell, a hallmark of atherosclerosis, is prominently derived from monocyte-differentiated macrophage, and vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMCs) through unlimitedly phagocytizing oxidized low-density lipoprotein (oxLDL). Therefore, the inhibition of monocyte adhesion to endothelium and uptake of oxLDL might be a breakthrough point for retarding atherosclerosis. Formononetin, an isoflavone extracted from <i>Astragalus membranaceus</i>, has exhibited multiple inhibitory effects on proatherogenic factors, such as obesity, dyslipidemia, and inflammation in different animal models. However, its effect on atherosclerosis remains unknown. In this study, we determined if formononetin can inhibit atherosclerosis and elucidated the underlying molecular mechanisms. <b>Methods</b>: ApoE deficient mice were treated with formononetin contained in high-fat diet for 16 weeks. After treatment, mouse aorta, macrophage and serum samples were collected to determine lesions, immune cell profile, lipid profile and expression of related molecules. Concurrently, we investigated the effect of formononetin on monocyte adhesion, foam cell formation, endothelial activation, and macrophage polarization <i>in vitro</i> and <i>in vivo</i>. <b>Results</b>: Formononetin reduced <i>en face</i> and aortic root sinus lesions size. Formononetin enhanced lesion stability by changing the composition of plaque. VSMC- and macrophage-derived foam cell formation and its accumulation in arterial wall were attenuated by formononetin, which might be attributed to decreased SRA expression and reduced monocyte adhesion. Formononetin inhibited atherogenic monocyte adhesion and inflammation. KLF4 negatively regulated the expression of SRA at transcriptional and translational level. <b>Conclusions</b>: Our study demonstrate that formononetin can substantially attenuate the development of atherosclerosis via regulation of interplay between KLF4 and SRA, which suggests the formononetin might be a novel therapeutic approach for inhibition of atherosclerosis.

Excessive accumulation of lipid inclusions in the arterial wall cells (foam cell formation) caused by modified low-density lipoprotein (LDL) is the earliest and most noticeable manifestation of atherosclerosis. The mechanisms of foam cell formation are not fully understood and can involve altered lipid uptake, impaired lipid metabolism, or both. Recently, we have identified the top 10 master regulators that were involved in the accumulation of cholesterol in cultured macrophages induced by the incubation with modified LDL. It was found that most of the identified master regulators were related to the regulation of the inflammatory immune response, but not to lipid metabolism. A possible explanation for this unexpected result is a stimulation of the phagocytic activity of macrophages by modified LDL particle associates that have a relatively large size. In the current study, we investigated gene regulation in macrophages using transcriptome analysis to test the hypothesis that the primary event occurring upon the interaction of modified LDL and macrophages is the stimulation of phagocytosis, which subsequently triggers the pro-inflammatory immune response. We identified genes that were up- or downregulated following the exposure of cultured cells to modified LDL or latex beads (inert phagocytosis stimulators). Most of the identified master regulators were involved in the innate immune response, and some of them were encoding major pro-inflammatory proteins. The obtained results indicated that pro-inflammatory response to phagocytosis stimulation precedes the accumulation of intracellular lipids and possibly contributes to the formation of foam cells. In this way, the currently recognized hypothesis that the accumulation of lipids triggers the pro-inflammatory response was not confirmed. Comparative analysis of master regulators revealed similarities in the genetic regulation of the interaction of macrophages with naturally occurring LDL and desialylated LDL. Oxidized and desialylated LDL affected a different spectrum of genes than naturally occurring LDL. These observations suggest that desialylation is the most important modification of LDL occurring in vivo. Thus, modified LDL caused the gene regulation characteristic of the stimulation of phagocytosis. Additionally, the knock-down effect of five master regulators, such as <i>IL15, EIF2AK3, F2RL1, TSPYL2</i>, and <i>ANXA1</i>, on intracellular lipid accumulation was tested. We knocked down these genes in primary macrophages derived from human monocytes. The addition of atherogenic naturally occurring LDL caused a significant accumulation of cholesterol in the control cells. The knock-down of the <i>EIF2AK3</i> and <i>IL15</i> genes completely prevented cholesterol accumulation in cultured macrophages. The knock-down of the <i>ANXA1</i> gene caused a further decrease in cholesterol content in cultured macrophages. At the same time, knock-down of <i>F2RL1</i> and <i>TSPYL2</i> did not cause an effect. The results obtained allowed us to explain in which way the inflammatory response and the accumulation of cholesterol are related confirming our hypothesis of atherogenesis development based on the following viewpoints: LDL particles undergo atherogenic modifications that, in turn, accompanied by the formation of self-associates; large LDL associates stimulate phagocytosis; as a result of phagocytosis stimulation, pro-inflammatory molecules are secreted; these molecules cause or at least contribute to the accumulation of intracellular cholesterol. Therefore, it became obvious that the primary event in this sequence is not the accumulation of cholesterol but an inflammatory response.

Atherosclerosis (AS) is a chronic inflammatory disease that contributes to multiple cardiovascular diseases (CVDs), and foam cell formation plays important roles in the progression of AS. There is an urgent need to identify new molecular targets for treating AS, and thereby improve the quality of life and reduce the financial burden of individuals with CVD. An in vitro model of AS was generated by treating THP-1 cells and human aortic vascular smooth muscle cells (HA-VSMCs) with oxidized low-density lipoproteins (ox-LDLs). HA-VSMC proliferation and foam cell formation were detected by the MTT assay and Oil Red O staining. C-X-C motif chemokine 12 (CXCL12) expression was suppressed by siRNA. An AS rat model was established by feeding rats a high-fat diet and vitamin D2 for 3 weeks. Histopathology examinations were conducted by Hematoxylin and Eosin (H&E) staining and the levels ionized calcium-binding adapter molecule 1 (IBA1) and α smooth muscle actin (α-SMA) expression were determined by ELISA assays and immunohistochemistry. An in vitro model of AS was established with THP-1 cells. CXCL12 expression in the model THP-1 cells was significantly increased when compared with its expression in control cells. Suppression of CXCL12 expression reduced the progression of AS in the cell model. Moreover, CXCL12 promoted AS in the in vivo rat model. Our results suggest that CXCL12 plays an important role in promoting the progression of AS. Furthermore, inhibition of CXCL12 might suppress the development of AS by inhibiting HA-VSMC proliferation and their transformation to foam cells.

Lipid droplet (LD) accumulation, a key feature of foam cells, constitutes an attractive target for therapeutic intervention in atherosclerosis. However, despite advances in cellular imaging techniques, current noninvasive and quantitative methods have limited application in living foam cells. Here, using optical diffraction tomography (ODT), we performed quantitative morphological and biophysical analysis of living foam cells in a label-free manner. We identified LDs in foam cells by verifying the specific refractive index using correlative imaging comprising ODT integrated with three-dimensional fluorescence imaging. Through time-lapse monitoring of three-dimensional dynamics of label-free living foam cells, we precisely and quantitatively evaluated the therapeutic effects of a nanodrug (mannose-polyethylene glycol-glycol chitosan-fluorescein isothiocyanate-lobeglitazone; MMR-Lobe) designed to affect the targeted delivery of lobeglitazone to foam cells based on high mannose receptor specificity. Furthermore, by exploiting machine-learning-based image analysis, we further demonstrated therapeutic evaluation at the single-cell level. These findings suggest that refractive index measurement is a promising tool to explore new drugs against LD-related metabolic diseases.

Abnormal lipid metabolism in macrophages leads to atherosclerosis (AS). Excessive LDL cholesterol uptake by macrophages in the aortic endothelium leads to formation of foam cells. Previous studies suggested that proanthocyanidins effectively suppress this process, while the in-depth mechanism has not been elucidated. In mononuclear THP-1 cells, we found that the oligomeric fraction of proanthocyanidins was more effective in suppressing foam cell formation and 25 μg ml-1 for 48 h were the optimum conditions. Under these model conditions, we investigated gene expression and for the first time reported expression of regulatory microRNA (miRNA). It was found that the proanthocyanidins restrained macrophage foaming mainly by lowering the expression levels of cholesterol influx-related receptors CD36 and SR-A, and promoting the expression of cholesterol efflux-related receptor ABCA1. Further, it was latest revealed that proanthocyanidins could notably inhibit the expression of ACAT1, a key gene for intracellular cholesterol esterification. Further investigation was performed on the expression of regulatory miRNAs (miR-134 for CD36, miR-134, miR-155 for SR-A, miR-155, let-7g for LOX-1, miR-9 for ACAT1, miR-27a, miR-19b, miR-10b and miR-33a for ABCA1). The relative expression of miR-9, a miRNA targeting ACAT1, was decreased after the treatment of proanthocyanidins. It was most likely that proanthocyanidins suppressed the expression of ACAT1 via up-regulating the expression of miR-9, thus lessening the intracellular lipid accumulation and eventually inhibiting macrophage foam cell formation. This assumption was further verified by use of miR-9 mimic and its inhibitor.
