What syndrome is associated with mutations in lysine methyltransferase 2D KMT2D?

[PMID: 28475860]
Epigenetic dysregulation has emerged as a recurring mechanism in the etiology of neurodevelopmental disorders. Two such disorders, CHARGE and Kabuki syndromes, result from loss of function mutations in chromodomain helicase DNA-binding protein 7 (CHD7<sup>LOF</sup>) and lysine (K) methyltransferase 2D (KMT2D<sup>LOF</sup>), respectively. Although these two syndromes are clinically distinct, there is significant phenotypic overlap. We therefore expected that epigenetically driven developmental pathways regulated by CHD7 and KMT2D would overlap and that DNA methylation (DNAm) alterations downstream of the mutations in these genes would identify common target genes, elucidating a mechanistic link between these two conditions, as well as specific target genes for each disorder. Genome-wide DNAm profiles in individuals with CHARGE and Kabuki syndromes with CHD7<sup>LOF</sup> or KMT2D<sup>LOF</sup> identified distinct sets of DNAm differences in each of the disorders, which were used to generate two unique, highly specific and sensitive DNAm signatures. These DNAm signatures were able to differentiate pathogenic mutations in these two genes from controls and from each other. Analysis of the DNAm targets in each gene-specific signature identified both common gene targets, including homeobox A5 (HOXA5), which could account for some of the clinical overlap in CHARGE and Kabuki syndromes, as well as distinct gene targets. Our findings demonstrate how characterization of the epigenome can contribute to our understanding of disease pathophysiology for epigenetic disorders, paving the way for explorations of novel therapeutics.

SCLC is a lethal neuroendocrine tumor type that is highly prone to metastasis. There is an urgency to understand the mutated genes that promote SCLC, as there are no approved targeted therapies yet available. SCLC is rarely resected, limiting the number of samples available for genomic analyses of somatic mutations. To identify potential driver mutations in human SCLC we sequenced the whole exomes of 18 primary SCLCs and seven cell lines along with matched normal controls. We extended these data by resequencing a panel of genes across 40 primary SCLCs and 48 cell lines. We report frequent mutations in the lysine methyltransferase 2D gene (KMT2D) (also known as MLL2), a key regulator of transcriptional enhancer function. KMT2D exhibited truncating nonsense/frameshift/splice site mutations in 8% of SCLC tumors and 17% of SCLC cell lines. We found that KMT2D mutation in human SCLC cell lines was associated with reduced lysine methyltransferase 2D protein levels and reduced monomethylation of histone H3 lysine 4, a mark associated with transcriptional enhancers. We also found mutations in other genes associated with transcriptional enhancer control, including CREB binding protein gene (CREBBP), E1A binding protein p300 gene (EP300), and chromodomain helicase DNA binding protein 7 gene (CHD7), and we report mutations in additional chromatin remodeling genes such as polybromo 1 gene (PBRM1). These data indicate that KMT2D is one of the major mutated genes in SCLC, and they point to perturbation of transcriptional enhancer control as potentially contributing to SCLC.

Kabuki syndrome (KS) is a rare congenital disorder characterized by distinctive facies, postnatal growth deficiency, cardiac defects and skeletal anomalies. Studies have determined that pathogenic variants of the lysine-specific methyltransferase 2D (KMT2D) and lysine-specific demethylase 6A (KDM6A) genes are the major causes of KS. The two genes encode different histone-modifying enzymes that are found in the same protein complex that is critical for cell differentiation during development. Here we report the results from next-generation sequencing of genomic DNA from 13 patients who had a clinical diagnosis of KS based on facial dysmorphism and other KS-specific cardinal phenotypes. Nine of the 13 patients were confirmed to be carrying heterozygous pathogenic KMT2D variants, seven of which were truncating and two were missense substitutions. Overall, we uncovered 11 novel variants - nine in KMT2D and two in KDM6A. Seven of the novel variants (all KMT2D) were likely causative of the KS phenotype. Our study expands the number of naturally occurring KMT2D and KDM6A variants. The discovery of novel pathogenic variants will add to the knowledge on disease-causing variants and the relevance of missense variants in KS.

Kabuki syndrome is an autosomal dominant developmental disorder with high similarities to CHARGE syndrome. It is characterized by a typical facial gestalt in combination with short stature, intellectual disability, skeletal findings and additional features like cardiac and urogenital malformations, cleft palate, hearing loss and ophthalmological anomalies. The major cause of Kabuki syndrome are mutations in KMT2D, a gene encoding a histone H3 lysine 4 (H3K4) methyltransferase belonging to the group of chromatin modifiers. Here we provide evidence that Kabuki syndrome is a neurocrestopathy, by showing that Kmt2d loss-of-function inhibits specific steps of neural crest (NC) development. Using the Xenopus model system, we find that Kmt2d loss-of-function recapitulates major features of Kabuki syndrome including severe craniofacial malformations. A detailed marker analysis revealed defects in NC formation as well as migration. Transplantation experiments confirm that Kmt2d function is required in NC cells. Furthermore, analyzing in vivo and in vitro NC migration behavior demonstrates that Kmt2d is necessary for cell dispersion but not protrusion formation of migrating NC cells. Importantly, Kmt2d knockdown correlates with a decrease in H3K4 monomethylation and H3K27 acetylation supporting a role of Kmt2d in the transcriptional activation of target genes. Consistently, using a candidate approach, we find that Kmt2d loss-of-function inhibits Xenopus Sema3F expression, and overexpression of Sema3F can partially rescue Kmt2d loss-of-function defects. Taken together, our data reveal novel functions of Kmt2d in multiple steps of NC development and support the hypothesis that major features of Kabuki syndrome are caused by defects in NC development.

KBG syndrome is a rare, autosomal dominant disorder caused by mutations or deletions leading to haploinsufficiency for the Ankrin Repeating Domain-Containing protein 11 (ANKRD11) at chromosome 16q24.3. Kabuki syndrome is caused by mutations or deletions of lysine (K)-specific methyltransferase 2D (KMT2D) and lysine-specific methylase 6A (KDM6A). We report on a male with developmental delays, cleft palate, craniofacial dysmorphism, hypotonia, and central nervous system anomalies including diminished white matter with thinning of the corpus callosum. Exome sequencing revealed a de novo mutation in ANKRD11, c.2606_2608delAGA, predicting p.Lys869del and an additional, de novo mutation, c.2353T>C, predicting p.Tyr785His in KDM1A, a gene not previously associated with a human phenotype. We describe this child as the first report of a deleterious sequence variant in KDM1A and hypothesize that his phenotype resulted from the combined effect of both mutations.

Kabuki syndrome is characterized by distinctive facial features and varying degrees of growth retardation. It leads to malformations in skeletal, urogenital and cardiac structures; moreover, endocrine conditions such as premature thelarche, precocious puberty, growth hormone deficiency, diabetes insipidus, thyroid dysfunction and obesity have been reported. Kabuki syndrome is caused by a heterozygous mutation in the KMT2D or KDM6A genes. An 11-year-old girl with the typical facial features of Kabuki syndrome visited our hospital due to her short stature. She was found to have the de novo heterozygous mutation of c.8200C > T, p(Arg2734*) in exon 32 of the KMT2D gene and was diagnosed with Kabuki syndrome. The patient also exhibited endocrine abnormalities such as a constitutional delay of puberty, transiently congenial hypothyroidism, obesity and growth hormone deficiency. This is a case of a mutation in the KMT2D gene in a girl with Kabuki syndrome who presented with endocrine symptoms (constitutional delay of puberty, hypothyroidism, obesity and growth hormone deficiency).

Kabuki syndrome is a haploinsufficient congenital multi-organ malformation syndrome, which frequently includes severe heart defects. Mutations in the histone H3K4 methyltransferase KMT2D have been identified as the main cause of Kabuki syndrome, however, the role of KMT2D in heart development remains to be characterized. Here we analyze the function of Kmt2d at different stages of Xenopus heart development. Xenopus Kmt2d is ubiquitously expressed at early stages of cardiogenesis, with enrichment in the anterior region including the cardiac precursor cells. Morpholino-mediated knockdown of Kmt2d led to hypoplastic hearts lacking the three-chambered structure. Analyzing different stages of cardiogenesis revealed that development of the first and second heart fields as well as cardiac differentiation were severely affected by loss of Kmt2d function. Kmt2d loss of function in Xenopus recapitulates the hypoplastic heart defects observed in Kabuki syndrome patients and shows that Kmt2d function is required for the establishment of the primary and secondary heart fields. Thus, Xenopus Kmt2d morphants can be a valuable tool to elucidate the etiology of the congenital heart defects associated with Kabuki syndrome.

Kabuki syndrome is a rare genetic disorder characterized by distinct dysmorphic facial features, intellectual disability, and multiple developmental abnormalities. Despite more than 350 documented cases, the oro-dental spectrum associated with kabuki syndrome and expression of <i>KMT2D</i> (histone-lysine N-methyltransferase 2D) or <i>KDM6A</i> (lysine-specific demethylase 6A) genes in tooth development have not been well defined. Here, we report seven unrelated Thai patients with Kabuki syndrome having congenital absence of teeth, malocclusion, high-arched palate, micrognathia, and deviated tooth shape and size. Exome sequencing successfully identified that six patients were heterozygous for mutations in <i>KMT2D</i>, and one in <i>KDM6A</i>. Six were novel mutations, of which five were in <i>KMT2D</i> and one in <i>KDM6A</i>. They were truncating mutations including four frameshift deletions and two nonsense mutations. The predicted non-functional KMT2D and KDM6A proteins are expected to cause disease by haploinsufficiency. Our study expands oro-dental, medical, and mutational spectra associated with Kabuki syndrome. We also demonstrate for the first time that <i>KMT2D</i> and <i>KDM6A</i> are expressed in the dental epithelium of human tooth germs.

Lysine methyltransferase 2D (KMT2D; OMIM 602113) encodes a histone methyltransferase involved in transcriptional regulation of the beta-globin and estrogen receptor as part of a large protein complex known as activating signal cointegrator-2-containing complex (ASCOM). Heterozygous germline mutations in the KMT2D gene are known to cause Kabuki syndrome (OMIM 147920), a developmental multisystem disorder. Neither holoprosencephaly nor other defects in human forebrain development have been previously associated with Kabuki syndrome. Here we report two patients diagnosed with alobar holoprosencephaly in their antenatal period with de novo monoallelic KMT2D variants identified by trio-based exome sequencing. The first patient was found to have a stop-gain variant c.12565G>T (p.Gly4189*), while the second patient had a missense variant c.5A>G (p.Asp2Gly). Phenotyping of each patient did not reveal any age-related feature of Kabuki syndrome. These two cases represent the first report on association between KMT2D and holoprosencephaly.

Chromatin modifiers act to coordinate gene expression changes critical to neuronal differentiation from neural stem/progenitor cells (NSPCs). Lysine-specific methyltransferase 2D (KMT2D) encodes a histone methyltransferase that promotes transcriptional activation and is frequently mutated in cancers and in the majority (>70%) of patients diagnosed with the congenital, multisystem intellectual disability disorder Kabuki syndrome 1 (KS1). Critical roles for KMT2D are established in various non-neural tissues, but the effects of KMT2D loss in brain cell development have not been described. We conducted parallel studies of proliferation, differentiation, transcription, and chromatin profiling in KMT2D-deficient human and mouse models to define KMT2D-regulated functions in neurodevelopmental contexts, including adult-born hippocampal NSPCs in vivo and in vitro. We report cell-autonomous defects in proliferation, cell cycle, and survival, accompanied by early NSPC maturation in several KMT2D-deficient model systems. Transcriptional suppression in KMT2D-deficient cells indicated strong perturbation of hypoxia-responsive metabolism pathways. Functional experiments confirmed abnormalities of cellular hypoxia responses in KMT2D-deficient neural cells and accelerated NSPC maturation in vivo. Together, our findings support a model in which loss of KMT2D function suppresses expression of oxygen-responsive gene programs important to neural progenitor maintenance, resulting in precocious neuronal differentiation in a mouse model of KS1.

CHARGE syndrome is a complex developmental disorder caused by mutations in the chromodomain helicase DNA-binding gene CHD7. Kabuki syndrome, another developmental disorder, is characterized by typical facial features in combination with developmental delay, short stature, prominent digit pads and visceral abnormalities. Mutations in the KMT2D gene, which encodes a H3K4 histone methyltransferase, are the major cause of Kabuki syndrome. Here, we report a patient, who was initially diagnosed with CHARGE syndrome based on the spectrum of inner organ malformations like choanal hypoplasia, heart defect, anal atresia, vision problems and conductive hearing impairment. While sequencing and MLPA analysis of all coding exons of CHD7 revealed no pathogenic mutation, sequence analysis of the KMT2D gene identified the heterozygous de novo nonsense mutation c.5263C > T (p.Gln1755*). Thus, our patient was diagnosed with Kabuki syndrome. By using co-immunoprecipitation, immunohistochemistry and direct yeast two hybrid assays, we could show that, like KMT2D, CHD7 interacts with members of the WAR complex, namely WDR5, ASH2L and RbBP5. We therefore propose that CHD7 and KMT2D function in the same chromatin modification machinery, thus pointing out a mechanistic connection, and presenting a probable explanation for the phenotypic overlap between Kabuki and CHARGE syndromes.

The recessive mutant mice bate palmas (bapa) - claps in Portuguese arose from N-ethyl-N-nitrosourea mutagenesis. A single nucleotide, T > C, change in exon 13, leading to a Thr<sub>1289</sub> Ala substitution, was identified in the lysine (K)-specific methyltransferase 2D gene (Kmt2d) located on chromosome 15. Mutations with a loss-of-function in the KMT2D gene on chromosome 12 in humans are responsible for Kabuki syndrome (KS). Phenotypic characterization of the bapa mutant was performed using a behavioral test battery to evaluate the parameters related to general activity, the sensory nervous system, the psychomotor system, and the autonomous nervous system, as well as to measure motor function and spatial memory. Relative to BALB/cJ mice, the bapa mutant showed sensory and psychomotor impairments, such as hypotonia denoted by a surface righting reflex impairment and hindquarter fall, and a reduction in the auricular reflex, suggesting hearing impairment. Additionally, the enhanced general activity showed by the increased rearing and grooming frequency, distance traveled and average speed possibly presupposes the presence of hyperactivity of bapa mice compared with the control group. A slight motor coordination dysfunction was showed in bapa mice, which had a longer crossing time on the balance beam compared with BALB/cJ controls. Male bapa mice also showed spatial gait pattern changes, such as a shorter stride length and shorter step length. In conclusion, the bapa mouse may be a valuable animal model to study the mechanisms involved in psychomotor and behavior impairments, such as hypotonia, fine motor coordination and hyperactivity linked to the Kmt2d mutation.

Kabuki syndrome (KS) is commonly caused by mutations in the histone-modifying enzyme lysine methyltransferase 2D (KMT2D). Immune dysfunction is frequently observed in individuals with KS, but the role of KMT2D in immune system function has not been identified. We sought to understand the mechanisms driving KS-associated immune deficiency (hypogammaglobulinemia [low IgA], splenomegaly, and diminished immunization responses). We performed a comprehensive evaluation of humoral immunity and secondary lymphoid tissues in an established KS (Kmt2d<sup>+/βGeo</sup>) mouse model and validated select findings in a patient with KS. Compared with wild-type littermates, Kmt2d<sup>+/βGeo</sup> mice demonstrated deficiencies in multiple B-cell lineages and reduced serum IgA and elevated IgM levels across multiple ages. The bone marrow, spleen, and intestine of Kmt2d<sup>+/βGeo</sup> mice contained diminished numbers of IgA-secreting cells, while elevated germinal center B cells were found in the mesenteric lymph node and Peyer patches. Kmt2d<sup>+/βGeo</sup> mice have decreased size and numbers of Peyer patches, a finding confirmed in human samples. We identified deficiency of Itgb7 RNA and protein expression, a gene encoding an adhesion protein that mediates intestinal homing, and we demonstrated KMT2D-dependent control of ITGB7 expression in a human cell line. Kmt2d haploinsufficiency has broad deleterious effects on B-cell differentiation, specifically hampering gut lymphocyte homing and IgA<sup>+</sup> plasma cell differentiation. Intestinal lymphoid defects caused by ITGB7 deficiency have not previously been recognized in KS, and these results provide new mechanistic insights into the pathogenesis of KS-associated immune deficiency.

Kabuki syndrome is characterized by a variable degree of intellectual disability, characteristic facial features, and complications in various organs. Many variants have been identified in two causative genes, that is, lysine methyltransferase 2D (KMT2D) and lysine demethylase 6A (KDM6A). In this study, we present the results of genetic screening of 100 patients with a suspected diagnosis of Kabuki syndrome in our center from July 2010 to June 2018. We identified 76 variants (43 novel) in KMT2D and 4 variants (3 novel) in KDM6A as pathogenic or likely pathogenic. Rare variants included a deep splicing variant (c.14000-8C>G) confirmed by RNA sequencing and an 18% mosaicism level for a KMT2D mutation. We also characterized a case with a blended phenotype consisting of Kabuki syndrome, osteogenesis imperfecta, and 16p13.11 microdeletion. We summarized the clinical phenotypes of 44 patients including a patient who developed cervical cancer of unknown origin at 16 years of age. This study presents important details of patients with Kabuki syndrome including rare clinical cases and expands our genetic understanding of this syndrome, which will help clinicians and researchers better manage and understand patients with Kabuki syndrome they may encounter.

Kabuki syndrome (KS) is a complex multisystem developmental disorder associated with mutation of genes encoding histone-modifying proteins. In addition to craniofacial, intellectual, and cardiac defects, KS is also characterized by humoral immune deficiency and autoimmune disease, yet no detailed molecular characterization of the KS-associated immune phenotype has been reported. We sought to characterize the humoral immune defects found in patients with KS with lysine methyltransferase 2D (KMT2D) mutations. We comprehensively characterized B-cell function in a cohort (n = 13) of patients with KS (age, 4 months to 27 years). Three quarters (77%) of the cohort had a detectable heterozygous KMT2D mutation (50% nonsense, 20% splice site, and 30% missense mutations), and 70% of the reported mutations are novel. Among the patients with KMT2D mutations (KMT2D(Mut/+)), hypogammaglobulinemia was detected in all but 1 patient, with IgA deficiency affecting 90% of patients and a deficiency in at least 1 other isoform seen in 40% of patients. Numbers of total memory (CD27(+)) and class-switched memory B cells (IgM(-)) were significantly reduced in patients with KMT2D(Mut/+) mutations compared with numbers in control subjects (P < .001). Patients with KMT2D(Mut/+) mutations also had significantly reduced rates of somatic hypermutation in IgG (P = .003) but not IgA or IgM heavy chain sequences. Impaired terminal differentiation was noted in primary B cells from patients with KMT2D(Mut/+) mutations. Autoimmune pathology was observed in patients with missense mutations affecting the SET domain and its adjacent domains. In patients with KS, autosomal dominant KMT2D mutations are associated with dysregulation of terminal B-cell differentiation, leading to humoral immune deficiency and, in some cases, autoimmunity. All patients with KS should undergo serial clinical immune evaluations.

Kabuki syndrome (KS) is a rare genetic syndrome characterized by multiple congenital anomalies and varying degrees of mental retardation. Patients with KS often present with facial, skeletal, visceral and dermatoglyphic abnormalities, cardiac anomalies and immunological defects. Mutation of the lysine methyltransferase 2D (KMT2D) gene (formerly known as MLL2) is the primary cause of KS. The present study reported the case of a 4‑year‑old Chinese girl who presented with atypical KS, including atypical facial features, unclear speech and suspected mental retardation. A diagnosis of KS was confirmed by genetic testing, which revealed a nonsense mutation in exon 16 of KMT2D (c.4485C>A, Tyr1495Ter). To the best of our knowledge, this is a novel mutation that has not been reported previously. The present case underscores the importance of genetic testing in KS diagnosis.

KMT2D, which encodes a histone H3K4 methyltransferase, has been implicated in human congenital heart disease in the context of Kabuki syndrome. However, its role in heart development is not understood. Here, we demonstrate a requirement for KMT2D in cardiac precursors and cardiomyocytes during cardiogenesis in mice. Gene expression analysis revealed downregulation of ion transport and cell cycle genes, leading to altered calcium handling and cell cycle defects. We further determined that myocardial Kmt2d deletion led to decreased H3K4me1 and H3K4me2 at enhancers and promoters. Finally, we identified KMT2D-bound regions in cardiomyocytes, of which a subset was associated with decreased gene expression and decreased H3K4me2 in mutant hearts. This subset included genes related to ion transport, hypoxia-reoxygenation and cell cycle regulation, suggesting that KMT2D is important for these processes. Our findings indicate that KMT2D is essential for regulating cardiac gene expression during heart development primarily via H3K4 di-methylation.

Pathogenic variants in KMT2D, which encodes lysine specific methyltransferase 2D, cause autosomal dominant Kabuki syndrome, associated with distinctive dysmorphic features including arched eyebrows, long palpebral fissures with eversion of the lower lid, large protuberant ears, and fetal finger pads. Most disease-causing variants identified to date are putative loss-of-function alleles, although 15-20% of cases are attributed to missense variants. We describe here four patients (including one previously published patient) with de novo KMT2D missense variants and with shared but unusual clinical findings not typically seen in Kabuki syndrome, including athelia (absent nipples), choanal atresia, hypoparathyroidism, delayed or absent pubertal development, and extreme short stature. These individuals also lack the typical dysmorphic facial features found in Kabuki syndrome. Two of the four patients had severe interstitial lung disease. All of these variants cluster within a 40-amino-acid region of the protein that is located just N-terminal of an annotated coiled coil domain. These findings significantly expand the phenotypic spectrum of features associated with variants in KMT2D beyond those seen in Kabuki syndrome and suggest a possible new underlying disease mechanism for these patients.

KMT2D (lysine (K)-specific methyltransferase 2D), formerly named MLL2 (myeloid/lymphoid or mixed-lineage leukemia 2, also known as ALR/MLL4), is a histone methyltransferase that plays an important role in regulating gene transcription. In particular, it targets histone H3 lysine 4 (H3K4), whose methylations serve as a gene activation mark. Recently, KMT2D has emerged as one of the most frequently mutated genes in a variety of cancers and in other human diseases, including lymphoma, medulloblastoma, gastric cancer, and Kabuki syndrome. Mutations in KMT2D identified thus far point to its loss-of-function in pathogenesis and suggest its role as a tumor suppressor in various tissues. To determine the effect of a KMT2D deficiency on neoplastic cells, we used homologous recombination- and nuclease-mediated gene editing approaches to generate a panel of isogenic colorectal and medulloblastoma cancer cell lines that differ with respect to their endogenous KMT2D status. We found that a KMT2D deficiency resulted in attenuated cancer cell proliferation and defective cell migration. Analysis of histone H3 modifications revealed that KMT2D was essential for maintaining the level of global H3K4 monomethylation and that its enzymatic SET domain was directly responsible for this function. Furthermore, we found that a majority of KMT2D binding sites are located in regions of potential enhancer elements. Together, these findings revealed the role of KMT2D in regulating enhancer elements in human cells and shed light on the tumorigenic role of its deficiency. Our study supports that KMT2D has distinct roles in neoplastic cells, as opposed to normal cells, and that inhibiting KMT2D may be a viable strategy for cancer therapeutics.
