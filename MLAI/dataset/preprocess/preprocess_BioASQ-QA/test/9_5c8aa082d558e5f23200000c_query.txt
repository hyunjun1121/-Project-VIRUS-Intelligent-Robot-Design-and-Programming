Cytosolic DNA stimulates innate immune responses, including type I interferons (IFN), which have antiviral and immunomodulatory activities. Cyclic GMP-AMP synthase (cGAS) recognizes cytoplasmic DNA and signals via STING to induce IFN production. Despite the importance of DNA in innate immunity, the nature of the DNA that stimulates IFN production is not well described. Using low DNA concentrations, we show that dsDNA induces IFN in a length-dependent manner. This is observed over a wide length-span of DNA, ranging from the minimal stimulatory length to several kilobases, and is fully dependent on cGAS irrespective of DNA length. Importantly, <i>in vitro</i> studies reveal that long DNA activates recombinant human cGAS more efficiently than short DNA, showing that length-dependent DNA recognition is an intrinsic property of cGAS independent of accessory proteins. Collectively, this work identifies long DNA as the molecular entity stimulating the cGAS pathway upon cytosolic DNA challenge such as viral infections.

Cyclic GMP-AMP synthase (cGAS) has recently been identified as the primary protein that detects cytosolic double stranded DNA to invoke a type I interferon response. The cGAS pathway is vital in the recognition of DNA encoded viruses as well as self-DNA leaked from the nucleus of damaged cells. Currently, the dynamics regulating the cGAS pathway are poorly understood; limiting our knowledge of how DNA-induced immune responses are regulated. Using systems biology approaches, we formulated a mathematical model to describe the dynamics of this pathway and examine the resulting system-level emergent properties. Unknown model parameters were fit to data compiled from literature using a Parallel Tempering Markov Chain Monte Carlo (PT-MCMC) approach, resulting in an ensemble of parameterized models. A local sensitivity analysis demonstrated that parameter sensitivity trends across model ensembles were independent of the select parameterization. An in-silico knock-down of TREX1 found that the interferon response is highly robust, showing that complete inhibition is necessary to induce chemical conditions consistent with chronic inflammation. Lastly, we demonstrate that the model recapitulates interferon expression data resulting from small molecule inhibition of cGAS. Overall, the importance of this model is exhibited in its capacity to identify sensitive components of the cGAS pathway, generate testable hypotheses, and confirm experimental observations.

The recognition of microbial nucleic acids is a major mechanism by which the immune system detects pathogens. Cyclic GMP-AMP (cGAMP) synthase (cGAS) is a cytosolic DNA sensor that activates innate immune responses through production of the second messenger cGAMP, which activates the adaptor STING. The cGAS-STING pathway not only mediates protective immune defense against infection by a large variety of DNA-containing pathogens but also detects tumor-derived DNA and generates intrinsic antitumor immunity. However, aberrant activation of the cGAS pathway by self DNA can also lead to autoimmune and inflammatory disease. Thus, the cGAS pathway must be properly regulated. Here we review the recent advances in understanding of the cGAS-STING pathway, focusing on the regulatory mechanisms and roles of this pathway in heath and disease.

Cyclic di-AMP (c-di-AMP) is a bacterial signaling nucleotide synthesized by several human pathogens. This widespread and specific bacterial product is recognized by infected host cells to trigger an innate immune response. Detection of c-di-AMP in the host cytosol leads primarily to the induction of type I interferon via the STING-cGAS signaling axis, while being also entangled in the activation of the NF-κB pathway. During their long-standing interaction, host and pathogens have co-evolved to control c-di-AMP activation of innate immunity. On the bacterial side, the quantity of c-di-AMP released inside cells allows to manipulate the host response to exacerbate infection by avoiding immune recognition or, at the opposite, by overloading the STING-cGAS pathway.

Cyclic GMP-AMP (cGAMP) synthase (cGAS) senses cytosolic DNA and catalyses synthesis of the second messenger cGAMP, which activates the downstream signalling adaptor protein STING, leading to the expression of type I interferons. Hepatitis B virus (HBV) is a small DNA virus, and the cGAS-STING pathway may inhibit HBV RNA synthesis and viral assembly in cell culture, but the exact roles of the cGAS pathway in the restriction of HBV replication in infection systems remain to be elucidated. In this study, replication of HBV was significantly inhibited both in cell culture and in vivo in a mouse model when the cGAS-STING pathway was activated by dsDNA or cGAMP. In contrast, the presence of enzymatically inactive cGAS mutant did not influence HBV replication. Moreover, knockdown of cGAS in human peripheral blood monocytes led to a higher level of intracellular HBV DNA. Collectively, our data indicate that the cGAS-STING pathway plays a role in the surveillance of HBV infection and may be exploited for development of novel anti-HBV strategies.

cGMP-AMP (cGAMP) synthase (cGAS) is a cytosolic DNA sensor that activates innate immune responses. cGAS catalyzes the synthesis of cGAMP, which functions as a second messenger that binds and activates the adaptor protein STING to induce type I interferons (IFNs) and other immune modulatory molecules. Here we show that cGAS is indispensable for the antitumor effect of immune checkpoint blockade in mice. Wild-type, but not cGAS-deficient, mice exhibited slower growth of B16 melanomas in response to a PD-L1 antibody treatment. Consistently, intramuscular delivery of cGAMP inhibited melanoma growth and prolonged the survival of the tumor-bearing mice. The combination of cGAMP and PD-L1 antibody exerted stronger antitumor effects than did either treatment alone. cGAMP treatment activated dendritic cells and enhanced cross-presentation of tumor-associated antigens to CD8 T cells. These results indicate that activation of the cGAS pathway is important for intrinsic antitumor immunity and that cGAMP may be used directly for cancer immunotherapy.

Cyclic GMP-AMP synthase (cGAS) is activated by ds-DNA binding to produce the secondary messenger 2',3'-cGAMP. cGAS is an important control point in the innate immune response; dysregulation of the cGAS pathway is linked to autoimmune diseases while targeted stimulation may be of benefit in immunoncology. We report here the structure of cGAS with dinucleotides and small molecule inhibitors, and kinetic studies of the cGAS mechanism. Our structural work supports the understanding of how ds-DNA activates cGAS, suggesting a site for small molecule binders that may cause cGAS activation at physiological ATP concentrations, and an apparent hotspot for inhibitor binding. Mechanistic studies of cGAS provide the first kinetic constants for 2',3'-cGAMP formation, and interestingly, describe a catalytic mechanism where 2',3'-cGAMP may be a minor product of cGAS compared with linear nucleotides.

The mechanisms by which hypoxic tumours evade immunological pressure and anti-tumour immunity remain elusive. Here, we report that two hypoxia-responsive microRNAs, miR-25 and miR-93, are important for establishing an immunosuppressive tumour microenvironment by downregulating expression of the DNA sensor cGAS. Mechanistically, miR-25/93 targets NCOA3, an epigenetic factor that maintains basal levels of cGAS expression, leading to repression of cGAS during hypoxia. This allows hypoxic tumour cells to escape immunological responses induced by damage-associated molecular pattern molecules, specifically the release of mitochondrial DNA. Moreover, restoring cGAS expression results in an anti-tumour immune response. Clinically, decreased levels of cGAS are associated with poor prognosis for patients with breast cancer harbouring high levels of miR-25/93. Together, these data suggest that inactivation of the cGAS pathway plays a critical role in tumour progression, and reveal a direct link between hypoxia-responsive miRNAs and adaptive immune responses to the hypoxic tumour microenvironment, thus unveiling potential new therapeutic strategies.

The cationic polysaccharide chitosan is an attractive candidate adjuvant capable of driving potent cell-mediated immunity, but the mechanism by which it acts is not clear. We show that chitosan promotes dendritic cell maturation by inducing type I interferons (IFNs) and enhances antigen-specific T helper 1 (Th1) responses in a type I IFN receptor-dependent manner. The induction of type I IFNs, IFN-stimulated genes and dendritic cell maturation by chitosan required the cytoplasmic DNA sensor cGAS and STING, implicating this pathway in dendritic cell activation. Additionally, this process was dependent on mitochondrial reactive oxygen species and the presence of cytoplasmic DNA. Chitosan-mediated enhancement of antigen specific Th1 and immunoglobulin G2c responses following vaccination was dependent on both cGAS and STING. These findings demonstrate that a cationic polymer can engage the STING-cGAS pathway to trigger innate and adaptive immune responses.
