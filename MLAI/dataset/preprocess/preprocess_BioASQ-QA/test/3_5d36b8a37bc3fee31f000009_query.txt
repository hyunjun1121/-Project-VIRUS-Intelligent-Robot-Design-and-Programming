What is the effect of Satb1 knock-out in mice?

Satb1 regulates chromatin structure and gene expression, and is aberrantly expressed in many tumors. However, there is still no report about Satb1 functions in peripheral nerve injury until now. In this study, we explored the regulatory effect of Satb1 on Schwann cells. MTT assay, transwell assay, and flow cytometry assay were respectively used to determine Schwann cell viability, migration, and apoptosis. The mRNA and phosphorylation levels of Satb1 and SHIP1 were assessed by RT-PCR and Western blotting analysis, respectively. The correlation between Satb1 and SHIP1 was examined by ChIP assay. The expressions of PI3K/AKT pathway related factors were detected by Western blotting. In the present study, we found that knock-out of Satb1 significantly inhibited cell viability and migration, and promoted Schwann cells apoptosis. Conversely, over-expression of Satb1 promoted cell viability, migration, and inhibited apoptosis. Satb1 inhibited SHIP1 expression by recruiting HDAC1. Furthermore, results showed that Satb1 activated the PI3K/AKT signaling pathway by inhibiting the expression of SHIP1. SHIP1 showed significant reversal effects on the regulatory roles of Satb1 in Schwann cells. Over-expression of Satb1 and SHIP1 inhibited cell viability, migration, and promoted apoptosis. Our study demonstrated that the Satb1 knock-out could inhibit the activation of PI3K/AKT pathway by up-regulating SHIP1, thus inhibiting cell viability and migration, and promoting Schwann cell apoptosis.

Special AT-rich binding protein 1 (SATB1) originally was identified as a protein that bound to the nuclear matrix attachment regions (MARs) of the immunoglobulin heavy chain intronic enhancer. Subsequently, SATB1 was shown to repress many genes expressed in the thymus, including interleukin-2 receptor alpha, c-myc, and those encoded by mouse mammary tumor virus (MMTV), a glucocorticoid-responsive retrovirus. SATB1 binds to MARs within the MMTV provirus to repress transcription. To address the role of the nuclear matrix in SATB1-mediated repression, a series of SATB1 deletion constructs was used to determine protein localization. Wild-type SATB1 localized to the soluble nuclear, chromatin, and nuclear matrix fractions. Mutants lacking amino acids 224-278 had a greatly diminished localization to the nuclear matrix, suggesting the presence of a nuclear matrix targeting sequence (NMTS). Transient transfection experiments showed that NMTS fusions to green fluorescent protein or LexA relocalized these proteins to the nuclear matrix. Difficulties with previous assay systems prompted us to develop retroviral vectors to assess effects of different SATB1 domains on expression of MMTV proviruses or integrated reporter genes. SATB1 overexpression repressed MMTV transcription in the presence and absence of functional glucocorticoid receptor. Repression was alleviated by deletion of the NMTS, which did not affect DNA binding, or by deletion of the MAR-binding domain. Our studies indicate that both nuclear matrix association and DNA binding are required for optimal SATB1-mediated repression of the integrated MMTV promoter and may allow insulation from cellular regulatory elements.

The genome organizer special AT-rich sequence binding protein 1 (SATB1) regulates specific functions through chromatin remodeling in T helper cells. It was recently reported by our team that T cells from SATB1 conditional knockout (SATB1cKO) mice, in which the Satb1 gene is deleted from hematopoietic cells, impair phosphorylation of signaling molecules in response to T cell receptor (TCR) crosslinking. However, in vivo T cell responses upon antigen presentation in the absence of SATB1 remain unclear. In the current study, it was shown that SATB1 modulates T cell antigen responses during the induction and effector phases. Expression of SATB1 was upregulated in response to TCR stimulation, suggesting that SATB1 is important for this antigen response. The role of SATB1 in TCR responses and induced experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE) was therefore examined using the myelin oligodendrocyte glycoprotein peptide 35-55 (MOG35-55) and pertussis toxin. SATB1cKO mice were found to be resistant to EAE and had defects in IL-17- and IFN-Î³-producing pathogenic T cells. Thus, SATB1 expression appears necessary for T cell function in the induction phase. To examine SATB1 function during the effector phase, a tamoxifen-inducible SATB1 deletion system, SATB1cKO-ER-Cre mice, was used. Encephalitogenic T cells from MOG35-55-immunized SATB1cKO-ER-Cre mice were transferred into healthy mice. Mice that received tamoxifen before the onset of paralysis were resistant to EAE. Furthermore, no disease progression occurred in recipient mice treated with tamoxifen after the onset of EAE. Thus, SATB1 is essential for maintaining TCR responsiveness during the induction and effector phases and may provide a novel therapeutic target for T cell-mediated autoimmune diseases.
