IDEAL_ANSWER:
- Pumilio1 (Pum1) has been shown to play key roles in translational regulation of target mRNAs in many systems of diverse organisms.
- Pumilio is a member of the highly conserved PUF family of RNA-binding proteins that function as a developmental regulator in diverse animal species. Pumilio1 (Pum1) has been shown to play key roles in translational regulation of target mRNAs in many systems of diverse organisms.

EXACT_ANSWER:
- developmental and translational regulator of RNA
- regulate specific target mRNAs posttranscriptionally
- translational regulation of target mRNAs
- RNA-binding proteins that function as a developmental regulator in diverse animal species.
