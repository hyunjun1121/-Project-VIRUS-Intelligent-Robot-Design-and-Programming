Although alpha-synuclein (alpha-syn) has been implicated as a major component of the abnormal filaments that form glial cytoplasmic inclusions (GCIs) in multiple system atrophy (MSA), it is uncertain if GCIs are homogenous and contain full-length alpha-syn. Since this has implications for hypotheses about the pathogenesis of GCIs, we used a novel panel of antibodies to defined regions throughout alpha-syn in immunohistochemical epitope mapping studies of GCIs in MSA brains. Although the immunostaining profile of GCIs with these antibodies was similar for all MSA brains, there were significant differences in the immunoreactivity of the alpha-syn epitopes detected in GCIs. Notably, carboxy-terminal alpha-syn epitopes were immunodominant in GCIs, but the entire panel of antibodies immunostained cortical Lewy bodies (LBs) in dementia with LBs brain with similar intensity. While the distribution of alpha-syn labeled GCIs paralleled that previously reported using silver stains, antibodies to carboxy-terminal alpha-syn epitopes revealed a previously undescribed burden of GCIs in the MSA hippocampal formation. Finally, Western blots demonstrated detergent insoluble monomeric and high-molecular weight alpha-syn species in GCI rich MSA cerebellar white matter. Collectively, these data indicate that alpha-syn is a prominent component of GCIs in MSA, and that GCIs and LBs may result from cell type specific conformational or post-translational permutations in alpha-syn.

The identification of the alpha-synuclein gene on chromosome 4q as a locus for familial Lewy-body parkinsonism and of alpha-synuclein as a component of Lewy bodies has heralded a new era in the study of Parkinson's disease. We have identified a large family with Lewy body parkinsonism linked to a novel locus on chromosome 4p15 that does not have a mutation in the alpha-synuclein gene. Here we report the clinical and neuropathological findings in an individual from this family and describe unusual high molecular weight alpha-synuclein-immunoreactive proteins in brain homogenates from brain regions with the most marked neuropathology. Distinctive histopathology was revealed with alpha-synuclein immunostaining, including pleomorphic Lewy bodies, synuclein-positive glial inclusions and widespread, severe neuritic dystrophy. We also discuss the relationship of this familial disorder to a Lewy body disease clinical spectrum, ranging from Parkinson's disease to dementia with psychosis.

We immunohistochemically investigated the degeneration processes of the nigro-striatal and nigro-amygdaloid pathways and the relationship between the loss of dopaminergic neurons and Lewy bodies (LB) formation in the substantia nigra using 15 autopsied cases of dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB). The number of tyrosine hydroxylase (TH)-positive neurons in the substantia nigra and TH-positive axonal terminals in the putamen decreased with a specific pattern. The substantia nigra possessed alpha-synuclein-positive LB-bearing neurons that were almost evenly distributed, while the putamen exhibited diffuse or granular alpha-synuclein-immunostaining. Most of the granular stains were positive for anti-phosphorylated alpha-synuclein antibody, whereas the diffuse stains were negative. These findings suggest that the axonal terminals in the putamen undergo abnormal alpha-synuclein accumulation, but may not always originate from LB-bearing neurons in the substantia nigra. The central amygdaloid nucleus contained anti-alpha-synuclein- and -phosphorylated alpha-synuclein-positive dystrophic axonal terminals, the degree of which was greater for cases with granular staining in the putamen, and which was proportional to the number of alpha-synuclein-positive neurons in the substantia nigra. Thus, the axonal terminals in the central amygdaloid nucleus may have originated from LB-bearing neurons in the substantia nigra. The results of the present study indicate that the nigro-striatal and nigro-amygdaloid pathways undergo different degeneration processes in DLB, and suggest that the degeneration of the nigro-amygdaloid pathway more strongly reflects LB formation in dopaminergic neurons of the substantia nigra than that of the nigro-striatal pathway. In addition, they indicate that there is no direct relationship between the loss of dopaminergic neurons and LB formation in the substantia nigra.

Parkinson's disease and dementia with Lewy bodies are very frequent neurological disorders of the elderly. Mutations in the alpha-synuclein (alphaSYN) gene cause Parkinson's disease, often associated with dementia. Neuropathologically these diseases are characterized by the presence of Lewy bodies and Lewy neurites, intraneuronal inclusions mostly composed of alphaSYN protein fibrils. Moreover, alphaSYN is phosphorylated at S129 (phospho-serine-129 [PSer129]) in neuropathological lesions. Using our (Thy1)-[A30P]alphaSYN transgenic mouse model that develops age-dependent impairment in fear conditioning behavior, we investigated PSer129 immunostaining in the brain. We found distinct staining patterns using new, sensitive monoclonal antibodies. Somal and nuclear PSer129 immunoreactivity increased with age in hippocampal and cortical areas as well as the lateral/basolateral amygdalar nuclei and was present also in young, pre-symptomatic mice, but not wild-type controls. The tendency of PSer129 immunostaining to accumulate in the nucleus was confirmed in cell culture. (Thy1)-[A30P]alphaSYN transgenic mice further developed age-dependent, specific neuritic/terminal alphaSYN pathology in the medial parts of the central amygdalar nucleus and one of its projection areas, the lateral hypothalamus. Interestingly, this type of PSer129 neuropathology was thioflavine S negative, unlike the Lewy-like neuropathology present in the brain stem of (Thy1)-[A30P]alphaSYN mice. Thus, alphaSYN becomes phosphorylated in distinct parts of the brain in this alpha-synucleinopathy mouse model, showing age-dependent increases of nuclear PSer129 in cortical brain areas and the formation of neuritic/terminal PSer129 neuropathology with variable amyloid quality within the fear conditioning circuitry and the brain stem.

α-Synuclein is the major protein associated with Lewy body dementia, Parkinson's disease and multiple system atrophy. Since α-synuclein is present in the brain in physiological conditions as a presynaptic protein, it is crucial to characterize disease-associated modifications to develop an in vivo biomarker. With the aim to develop antibodies showing high specificity and sensitivity for disease-associated α-synuclein, synthetic peptides containing different amino acid sequences were used for immunization of mice. After generation of α-synuclein aggregates, ELISA and immunoblotting were used to test the specificity of antibodies. Tissue microarray sections originating from different human α-synucleinopathies were used to compare immunostaining with other, commercially available antibodies. Immunization of mice with the peptide TKEGVVHGVATVAE (amino acid 44-57 of α-synuclein) resulted in the generation of a monoclonal antibody (5G4), which was able to bind aggregated α-synuclein preparation in sandwich ELISA or coated on magnetic beads. 5G4 proved to be superior to other antibodies in comparative immunohistochemical studies by revealing more widespread and distinct α-synuclein pathology. Immunoblotting of human brain tissue revealed an additional band seen in dementia with Lewy bodies, whereas the band representing monomeric α-synuclein was very weak or lacking. In summary, the 5G4 antibody is most promising for re-evaluation of archival material and may offer new perspective for the development of in vivo diagnostic assays for detecting disease-associated α-synuclein in body fluids.

A mutation in the alpha-synuclein gene has recently been linked to some cases of familial Parkinson's disease (PD). We characterized the expression of this presynaptic protein in the midbrain, striatum, and temporal cortex of control, PD, and dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB) brain. Control brain showed punctate pericellular immunostaining. PD brain demonstrated alpha-synuclein immunoreactivity in nigral Lewy bodies, pale bodies and abnormal neurites. Rare neuronal soma in PD brain were immunoreactive for alpha-synuclein. DLB cases demonstrated these findings as well as alpha-synuclein immunoreactivity in cortical Lewy bodies and CA2-3 neurites. These results suggest that, even in sporadic cases, there is an early and direct role for alpha-synuclein in the pathogenesis of PD and the neuropathologically related disorder DLB.

Diffuse Lewy body disease (DLBD) is characterized by the presence of Lewy bodies (LB) in the neurons and neurites of cortical, subcortical, and brain stem structures. Recently, alpha-synuclein (alphaS) has been found to be a central constituent of LB. In DLBD, abnormal accumulation of alphaS has been reported in both neurons and glia, but studies on glial lesions in DLBD have been limited. We examined in detail the constituents and distribution of glial lesions in eight patients with DLBD and report the pathogenesis of the glial lesions. alphaS-positive neuronal cytoplasmic inclusions (NI), neuropil threads (NT), and coiled bodies (CB) showed similar immunostaining profiles. Without pretreatment, NI, NT, and CB were detected by all antibodies against alphaS. The immunostaining profile of star-like astrocytes (SLA) was quite different from those of NI, NT, and CB. A few SLA were stained by an antibody against the non-Abeta component portion of alphaS without pretreatment, but formic acid pretreatment dramatically enhanced SLA immunoreactivity. SLA and CB were found in all eight brains with DLBD. SLA were scarce in the brain stem, but there were hundreds of SLA per visual field at x100 magnification in the temporal cortex of most cases, while CB were found diffusely in both the cerebral cortex and brain stem, similar to NI. This suggests that the pathogenesis of SLA is different from those of NI and CB.

Progressive supranuclear palsy (PSP) is a neurodegenerative tauopathy characterized by Parkinsonism, vertical gaze palsy, and early falls. Lewy bodies (LBs) are detected in approximately 10% of PSP cases, but there is little information on the relationship of LBs to tau pathology. We determined the frequency of LBs in a large series of autopsy-confirmed cases of PSP and studied the density and distribution of LBs, including Parkinson disease stage, in cases with LBs (PSP/LBD). PSP/LBD was compared with pure LB disease (LBD), including assessment of neuronal loss in key brainstem nuclei. Immunohistochemistry for alpha-synuclein revealed LBs in 31 of 290 PSP cases (11%). One case had multiple system atrophy in addition to PSP and was excluded from further study along with 2 PSP/LBD cases with concurrent Alzheimer disease. The 29 cases of PSP/LBD were compared with 30 cases of PSP and 24 cases of LBD. The age, sex, brain weight, Braak neurofibrillary tangle (NFT) stage, as well as counts of NFTs and senile plaques were not different among PSP, LBD, and PSP/LBD, but disease duration was longer in LBD. The Parkinson disease stage was similar, but the density of LBs in most subcortical nuclei tended to be greater in LBD than in PSP/LBD. In contrast, substantia nigra neuronal loss was greater in PSP/LBD than both PSP and LBD. Double immunostaining demonstrated alpha-synuclein and tau in different neurons with few exceptions. The findings suggest that LBs in PSP are similar in distribution to those in LBD and independent of tau pathology. The greater density of LBs in LBD compared with PSP/LBD may be the result of longer disease duration in LBD, whereas greater neuronal loss in the substantia nigra in PSP/LBD may be the result of vulnerability of this brain region to both disease processes.

alpha-Synuclein is a presynaptic protein recently identified as a specific component of Lewy bodies (LB) and Lewy neurites. The aim of this study was to assess the morphology and distribution of alpha-synuclein immunoreactivity in cases of dementia with LB (DLB), and to compare alpha-synuclein with ubiquitin immunostaining. We examined substantia nigra, paralimbic regions (entorhinal cortex, cingulate gyrus, insula and hippocampus), and neocortex (frontal and occipital association cortices) with double alpha-synuclein and ubiquitin immunostaining in 25 cases meeting neuropathological criteria for DLB. alpha-Synuclein immunostaining was more specific than ubiquitin immunostaining in that it differentiated LB from globose tangles. It was also slightly more sensitive, staining 4-5% more intracytoplasmic structures, especially diffuse alpha-synuclein deposits that were ubiquitin negative. In addition to LB, alpha-synuclein staining showed filiform and globose neurites in the substantia nigra, CA2-3 regions of the hippocampus, and entorhinal cortex. A spectrum of alpha-synuclein staining was seen in substantia nigra: from diffuse "cloud-like" inclusions to aggregated intracytoplasmic inclusions with variable ubiquitin staining to classic LB. We hypothesize that these represent different stages in LB formation.

The precursor of the non-Abeta component of Alzheimer's disease amyloid (NACP) (also known as alpha-synuclein) is a presynaptic terminal molecule that abnormally accumulates in the plaques of Alzheimer's disease (AD) and in the Lewy bodies (LBs) of Lewy body variant of AD, diffuse Lewy body disease, and Parkinson's disease. To better understand the distribution of NACP/alpha-synuclein and its fragments in the LB-bearing neurons and neurites, as well as to clarify the patterns of NACP/alpha-synuclein compartmentalization, we studied NACP/alpha-synuclein immunoreactivity using antibodies against the C-terminal, N-terminal, and NAC regions after Proteinase K and formic acid treatment in the cortex of patients with LBs. Furthermore, studies of the subcellular localization of NACP/alpha-synuclein within LB-bearing neurons were performed by immunogold electron microscopy. These studies showed that the N-terminal antibody immunolabeled the LBs and dystrophic neurites with great intensity and, to a lesser extent, the synapses. In contrast, the C-terminal antibody strongly labeled the synapses and, to a lesser extent, the LBs and dystrophic neurites. Whereas Proteinase K treatment enhanced NACP/alpha-synuclein immunoreactivity with the C-terminal antibody, it diminished the N-terminal NACP/alpha-synuclein immunoreactivity. Furthermore, formic acid enhanced LB and dystrophic neurite labeling with both the C- and N-terminal antibodies. In addition, whereas without pretreatment only slight anti-NAC immunoreactivity was found in the LBs, formic acid pretreatment revealed an extensive anti-NAC immunostaining of LBs, plaques, and glial cells. Ultrastructural analysis revealed that NACP/alpha-synuclein immunoreactivity was diffusely distributed within the amorphous electrodense material in the LBs and as small clusters in the filaments of LBs and neurites. These results support the view that aggregated NACP/alpha-synuclein might play an important role in the pathogenesis of disorders associated with LBs.

Dementia is a frequent complication of idiopathic parkinsonism or PD, usually occurring later in the protracted course of the illness. The primary site of neuropathologic change in PD is the substantia nigra, but the neuropathologic and molecular basis of dementia in PD is less clear. Although Alzheimer's pathology has been a frequent finding, recent advances in immunostaining of alpha-synuclein have suggested the possible importance of cortical Lewy bodies (CLBs) in the brains of demented patients with PD. The brains of 22 demented and 20 nondemented patients with a clinical and neuropathologic diagnosis of PD were evaluated with standard neuropathologic techniques. In addition, CLBs and dystrophic neurites were identified immunohistochemically with antibodies specific for alpha-synuclein and ubiquitin; plaques and tangles were identified by staining with thioflavine S. Associations between dementia status and pathologic markers were tested with logistic regression. CLBs positive for alpha-synuclein are highly sensitive (91%) and specific (90%) neuropathologic markers of dementia in PD and slightly more sensitive than ubiquitin-positive CLBs. They are better indicators of dementia than neurofibrillary tangles, amyloid plaques, or dystrophic neurites. CLBs detected by alpha-synuclein antibodies in patients with PD are a more sensitive and specific correlate of dementia than the presence of Alzheimer's pathology, which was present in a minority of the cases in this series.

Hallervorden-Spatz syndrome (HSS) is a rare autosomal recessive disorder clinically characterized by extrapyramidal signs and progressive dementia. In a typical case, the clinical symptoms become apparent during late childhood, and usually the course is protracted over a decade or more. We recently had an opportunity to study the brains of two cases of HSS with a clinical course of over 30 years. Case 1 was a 44-year-old female and case 2 was a 37-year-old male. Grossly, the brains showed severe fronto-temporal lobar atrophy with abundant spheroids and mild iron deposits in the globus pallidus, associated with features of motor neuron disease. In addition, there was diffuse sponginess in the atrophic cortex as well as widespread Alzheimer's neurofibrillary tangles (NFTs) and Lewy bodies (LBs) in the cortical and subcortical regions, including the spinal cord. Ultrastructurally, NFTs were composed of paired helical filaments, and LBs of central dense cores with radiating fibrils. Discrete immunostaining was demonstrated in NFTs and neuropil threads with various antibodies against phosphorylated tau, and in LBs with antibody against alpha-synuclein. In addition, diffuse, overlapping immunoreactivity of alpha-synuclein and phosphorylated tau was seen within the cytoplasm of many neurons. However, when LBs and NFTs coexisted within the same neurons, they were clearly segregated. The findings of our present cases as well as those reported in the literature may indicate that simultaneous and extensive occurrence of abnormal phosphorylation of tau and accumulation of alpha-synuclein may constitute cardinal pathological features of HSS with protracted clinical course.

It is increasingly clear that the normal protein alpha-synuclein is in some manner closely associated with presynaptic components of select neuronal types within the adult human central nervous system (CNS) and, in addition, that in its pathologically altered state alpha-synuclein aggregates selectively in the form of filamentous inclusion bodies during certain progressive neurodegenerative disorders, such as familial and sporadic Parkinson's disease. By having the antibody AFshp raised specifically to alpha-synuclein to label Parkinson disease-specific Lewy bodies and Lewy neurites as well as synaptic boutons containing the unaltered protein, an initial attempt is made to map the overall distribution pattern and describe the staining behavior of the immunoreactive punctae in select regions of the prosencephalon. Neocortical immunolabeling is most prominent in the prodigious, but incompletely myelinated, association fields and faintest in the heavily myelinated primary motor and primary sensory fields, with the premotor and first order sensory association areas occupying an intermediate position. Of the thalamic grays evaluated, those containing powerfully myelinated fiber tracts (e.g. centrum medianum, habenular complex) show the weakest immunolabeling, whereas, less sturdily myelinated structures are highly immunoreactive. The fact that the immunostaining spectrum for normal alpha-synuclein is so broad, together with the fact that some thalamic sites actually are immunonegative leads to the following conclusions (1) alpha-synuclein, although present in the synaptic boutons of many nerve cells in the adult human CNS, is by no means ubiquitous there, and (2) neuronal types lacking the normal protein cannot generate the Parkinson's disease-specific filamentous pathology.

The major protein constituent of Lewy bodies (LBs), the pathological hallmark of Parkinson disease and dementia with Lewy bodies, is considered to be alpha-synuclein, but other proteins, in particular the microtubule-associated protein tau, have been implicated in the pathogenesis of LBs. Tau is the major structural component of neurofibrillary tangles (NFTs). Both direct immunochemical studies of partially purified LBs and indirect immunohistochemical studies have suggested that LBs may contain tau, but most of these studies were based upon a single tau antibody, and immunologic cross-reactivity was not completely excluded. To gain insight into the relation between tau and alpha-synuclein in LBs, double immunostaining was performed in Lewy body cases with a rabbit polyclonal antibody to alpha-synuclein and a panel of monoclonal antibodies to phospho- and nonphospho-tau epitopes (Alz50, CP9, CP13, PG5, TG3, PHFI) that spanned the length of the tau molecule. Tau-immunoreactive LBs were present in the medulla in 80% of the cases, irrespective of Braak stage. All tau antibodies recognized at least some LBs, arguing against nonspecific antibody cross-reactivity. In most lesions the tau immunostaining was present at the periphery of the LB. The phospho-tau antibody, TG3, detected more LBs than any of the other tau antibodies. The proportion of LBs with tau immunoreactivity was greatest in neurons vulnerable to NETs, such as those in the locus ceruleus and basal nucleus of Meynert, and least in neurons resistant to NFTs, such as the dorsal motor nucleus of the vagus in the medulla. The present results suggest that tau may coaggregate with alpha-synuclein in LBs, especially in neuronal populations vulnerable to both NFTs and LBs.
