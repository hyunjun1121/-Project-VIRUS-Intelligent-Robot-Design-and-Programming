What is the function of HDAC  proteins?

[PMID: 17767915]
The function of eukaryotic histone deacetylase (HDAC) has been extensively studied for its critical role in transcriptional regulation and carcinogenesis. However that of the prokaryotic counterpart remains largely unknown. Recently, we cloned HDAC-like protein in Thermus caldophilus GK24 (Tca HDAC) from a genomic library of the microorganism based on homology analysis with human HDAC1. To explore the function of Tca HDAC in mammalian cells, Tca HDAC gene expressing vector was transfected into a human fibrosarcoma cell line, HT1080. Tca HDAC was mainly localized in nuclei of the mammalian cells as a human HDAC1 was, due to an N-terminal HDAC association domain. We further generated histidine-substituted Tca HDAC mutants and investigated their role in biochemical and cellular activity of the enzyme. Tca HDAC mutants exhibited dramatic loss of enzymatic activity and conditioned media (CM) from HT1080 cells transfected with mutant Tca HDAC was unable to stimulate angiogenic phenotypes of endothelial cells in vitro whereas that of wild Tca HDAC did. Collectively, these results demonstrate that a prokaryotic histone deacetylase from T. caldophilus GK24 is functionally active in mammalian cells and its function in gene expression is conserved from prokaryotes to eukaryotes.

Gene expression is in part controlled by chromatin remodeling factors and the acetylation state of nucleosomal histones. The latter process is regulated by histone acetyltransferases and histone deacetylases (HDACs). Previously, three human and five yeast HDAC enzymes had been identified. These can be categorized into two classes: the first class represented by yeast Rpd3-like proteins and the second by yeast Hda1-like proteins. Human HDAC1, HDAC2, and HDAC3 proteins are members of the first class, whereas no class II human HDAC proteins had been identified. The amino acid sequence of Hda1p was used to search the GenBank/expressed sequence tag databases to identify partial sequences from three putative class II human HDAC proteins. The corresponding full-length cDNAs were cloned and defined as HDAC4, HDAC5, and HDAC6. These proteins possess certain features present in the conserved catalytic domains of class I human HDACs, but also contain additional sequence domains. Interestingly, HDAC6 contains an internal duplication of two catalytic domains, which appear to function independently of each other. These class II HDAC proteins have differential mRNA expression in human tissues and possess in vitro HDAC activity that is inhibited by trichostatin A. Coimmunoprecipitation experiments indicate that these HDAC proteins are not components of the previously identified HDAC1 and HDAC2 NRD and mSin3A complexes. However, HDAC4 and HDAC5 associate with HDAC3 in vivo. This finding suggests that the human class II HDAC enzymes may function in cellular processes distinct from those of HDAC1 and HDAC2.

Normal cell function is dependent on the proper maintenance of chromatin structure. Regulation of chromatin structure is controlled by histone modifications that directly influence chromatin architecture and genome function. Specifically, the histone deacetylase (HDAC) family of proteins modulate chromatin compaction and are commonly dysregulated in many tumors, including colorectal cancer (CRC). However, the role of HDAC proteins in early colorectal carcinogenesis has not been previously reported. We found HDAC1, HDAC2, HDAC3, HDAC5, and HDAC7 all to be up-regulated in the field of human CRC. Furthermore, we observed that HDAC2 up-regulation is one of the earliest events in CRC carcinogenesis and observed this in human field carcinogenesis, the azoxymethane-treated rat model, and in more aggressive colon cancer cell lines. The universality of HDAC2 up-regulation suggests that HDAC2 up-regulation is a novel and important early event in CRC, which may serve as a biomarker. HDAC inhibitors (HDACIs) interfere with tumorigenic HDAC activity; however, the precise mechanisms involved in this process remain to be elucidated. We confirmed that HDAC inhibition by valproic acid (VPA) targeted the more aggressive cell line. Using nuclease digestion assays and transmission electron microscopy imaging, we observed that VPA treatment induced greater changes in chromatin structure in the more aggressive cell line. Furthermore, we used the novel imaging technique partial wave spectroscopy (PWS) to quantify nanoscale alterations in chromatin. We noted that the PWS results are consistent with the biological assays, indicating a greater effect of VPA treatment in the more aggressive cell type. Together, these results demonstrate the importance of HDAC activity in early carcinogenic events and the unique role of higher-order chromatin structure in determining cell tumorigenicity.

The epigenetic regulation of DNA structure and function is essential for changes in gene expression involved in development, growth, and maintenance of cellular function. Epigenetic changes include histone modifications such as methylation, acetylation, ubiquitination, and phosphorylation. Histone deacetylase (HDAC) proteins have a major role in epigenetic regulation of chromatin structure. HDACs are enzymes that catalyze the removal of acetyl groups from lysine residues within histones, as well as a range of other proteins including transcriptional factors. HDACs are highly conserved proteins divided into two families and based on sequence similarity in four classes. Here we will discuss the roles of Rpd3 in physiology and longevity with emphasis on its role in flies. Rpd3, the Drosophila HDAC1 homolog, is a class I lysine deacetylase and a member of a large family of HDAC proteins. Rpd3 has multiple functions including control of proliferation, development, metabolism, and aging. Pharmacological and dietary HDAC inhibitors have been used as therapeutics in psychiatry, cancer, and neurology.

Class I histone deacetylases (HDACs) are known to remove acetyl groups from histone tails. This liberates positive charges on the histone tail and allows for tighter winding of DNA, preventing transcription factor binding and gene activation. Although the functions of HDAC proteins are becoming apparent both biochemically and clinically, how this class of proteins is regulated remains poorly understood. We identified a novel interaction between nuclear actin and HDAC 1 and HDAC 2. Nuclear actin has been previously shown to interact with a growing list of nuclear proteins including chromatin remodeling complexes, transcription factors and RNA polymerases. We find that monomeric actin is able to bind the class I HDAC complex. Furthermore, increasing the concentration of actin in HeLa nuclear extracts was able to suppress overall HDAC function. Conversely, polymerizing nuclear actin increased HDAC activity and decreased histone acetylation. Moreover, the interaction between class I HDACs and nuclear actin was found to be activity dependent. Together, our data suggest nuclear actin is able to regulate HDAC 1 and 2 activity.

Transcription is controlled in part by the dynamic acetylation and deacetylation of histone proteins. The latter process is mediated by histone deacetylases (HDACs). Previous analysis of the regulation of HDAC activity in transcription has focused primarily on the recruitment of HDAC proteins to specific promoters or chromosomal domains by association with DNA-binding proteins. To characterize the cellular function of the recently identified HDAC4 and HDAC5 proteins, complexes were isolated by immunoprecipitation. Both HDACs were found to interact with14-3-3 proteins at three phosphorylation sites. The association of 14-3-3 with HDAC4 and HDAC5 results in the sequestration of these proteins in the cytoplasm. Loss of this interaction allows HDAC4 and HDAC5 to translocate to the nucleus, interact with HDAC3, and repress gene expression. Regulation of the cellular localization of HDAC4 and HDAC5 by 14-3-3 represents a mechanism for controlling the transcriptional activity of these class II HDAC proteins.

Accessibility of the genome to DNA-binding transcription factors is regulated by proteins that control the acetylation of amino-terminal lysine residues on nucleosomal histones. Specifically, histone deacetylase (HDAC) proteins repress transcription by deacetylating histones. To date, the only known regulatory mechanism of HDAC1 function is via interaction with associated proteins. Although the control of HDAC1 function by protein interaction and recruitment is well precedented, we were interested in exploring HDAC1 regulation by post-translational modification. Human HDAC1 protein was analyzed by ion trap mass spectrometry, and two phosphorylated serine residues, Ser(421) and Ser(423), were unambiguously identified. Loss of phosphorylation at Ser(421) and Ser(423) due to mutation to alanine or disruption of the casein kinase 2 consensus sequence directing phosphorylation reduced the enzymatic activity and complex formation of HDAC1. Deletion of the highly charged carboxyl-terminal region of HDAC1 also decreased its deacetylase activity and protein associations, revealing its requirement in maintaining HDAC1 function. Our results reinforce the importance of protein associations in modulating HDAC1 function and provide the first step toward characterizing the role of post-translational modifications in regulating HDAC activity in vivo.

Post-partum uterine disorders and reproductive tract infections cause ovarian dysfunction and infertility. Histone deacetylases (HDACs) prevent the relaxation of chromatin, and positively or negatively regulate transcription. Hence, HDACs play a pivotal role in altering the gene expression that impact different signalling pathways underling ovarian dysfunction. Thus, HDAC inhibitors (HDACi) may act as potential therapeutic targets in the treatment of an array of disorders impacting ovarian function.

Histone deacetylases (HDACs) are key regulators of gene expression that require assembly into larger protein complexes for activity. Efforts to understand how associated proteins modulate the function of HDACs would benefit from new technologies that evaluate HDAC activity in native biological systems. Here, we describe an active site-directed chemical probe for profiling HDACs in native proteomes and live cells. This probe, designated SAHA-BPyne, contains structural elements of the general HDAC inhibitor suberoylanilide hydroxamic acid (SAHA), as well as benzophenone and alkyne moieties to effect covalent modification and enrichment of HDACs, respectively. Both class I and II HDACs were identified as specific targets of SAHA-BPyne in proteomes. Interestingly, multiple HDAC-associated proteins were also enriched by SAHA-BPyne, even after denaturation of probe-labeled proteomes. These data indicate that certain HDAC-associated proteins are directly modified by SAHA-BPyne, placing them in close proximity to HDAC active sites where they would be primed to regulate substrate recognition and activity. We further show that SAHA-BPyne can be used to measure differences in HDAC content and complex assembly in human disease models. This chemical proteomics probe should thus prove valuable for profiling both the activity state of HDACs and the binding proteins that regulate their function.

The generation of functionally distinct neuronal subtypes within the vertebrate central nervous system (CNS) requires the precise regulation of progenitor gene expression in specific neuronal territories during early embryogenesis. Accumulating evidence has implicated histone deacetylase (HDAC) proteins in cell specification, proliferation, and differentiation in diverse embryonic and adult tissues. However, although HDAC proteins have shown to be expressed in the developing vertebrate neural tube, their specific role in CNS neural progenitor fate specification remains unclear. Prior work from our lab showed that the Tcf7l2/Tcf4 transcription factor plays a key role in ventral progenitor lineage segregation by differential repression of two key specification factors, Nkx2.2 and Olig2. In this study, we found that administration of HDAC inhibitors (Valproic Acid (VPA), Trichostatin-A (TSA), or sodium butyrate) in chick embryos in ovo disrupted normal progenitor gene segregation in the developing neural tube, indicating that HDAC activity is required for this process. Further, using functional and pharmacological approaches in vivo, we found that HDAC activity is required for the differential repression of Nkx2.2 and Olig2 by Tcf7l2/Tcf4. Finally, using dominant-negative functional assays, we provide evidence that Tcf7l2/Tcf4 repression also requires Gro/TLE/Grg co-repressor factors. Together, our data support a model where the transcriptional repressor activity of Tcf7l2/Tcf4 involves functional interactions with both HDAC and Gro/TLE/Grg co-factors at specific target gene regulatory elements in the developing neural tube, and that this activity is required for the proper segregation of the Nkx2.2 (p3) and Olig2 (pMN) expressing cells from a common progenitor pool.

Histone deacetylases (HDACs) modify core histones and participate in large regulatory complexes that both suppress and enhance transcription. Recent studies indicate that some HDACs can act on non-histone proteins as well. Interest in these enzymes is growing because HDAC inhibitors appear to be promising therapeutic agents against cancer and a variety of other diseases. Thus far, 11 members of the HDAC family have been identified in humans, but few have been characterized in detail. To better define the biological function of these proteins, make maximal use of studies performed in other systems, and assist in drug development efforts, we have performed a phylogenetic analysis of all HDAC-related proteins in all fully sequenced free-living organisms. Previous analyses have divided non-sirtuin HDACs into two groups, classes 1 and 2. We find that HDACs can be divided into three equally distinct groups: class 1, class 2, and a third class consisting of proteins related to the recently identified human HDAC11 gene. We term this novel group "class 4" to distinguish it from the unrelated "class 3" sirtuin deacetylases. Analysis of gene duplication events indicates that the common ancestor of metazoan organisms contained two class 1, two class 2, and a single class 4 HDAC. Examination of HDAC characteristics in light of these evolutionary relationships leads to functional predictions, among them that self-association is common among HDAC proteins. All three HDAC classes (including class 4) exist in eubacteria. Phylogenetic analysis of bacterial HDAC relatives suggests that all three HDAC classes precede the evolution of histone proteins and raises the possibility that the primary activity of some "histone deacetylase" enzymes is directed against non-histone substrates.

Cellular chaperones promote the folding and maturation of newly synthesized proteins and partially folded proteins in the cytosol and endoplasmic reticulum (ER) as well as prevent the aggregation of misfolded proteins. Histone deacetylases (HDACs) and histone acetyl transferases catalyze the reversible acetylation of histones and nonhistone substrates to control the epigenetic and transcriptomic landscape of normal and tumor cells. Treatment with HDAC inhibitors results in the hyperacetylation of chaperones including heat shock protein (hsp)90, hsp70, hsp40, and the ER-resident hsp70 homolog, glucose-regulated protein 78 (GRP78), which affects their function. HDAC inhibitor-mediated deregulation of chaperone function, in turn, deregulates protein homeostasis and induces protein misfolding and proteotoxic stress. In the context of tumors which are particularly dependent on functional chaperones for maintaining protein homeostasis, HDAC inhibitors tip the balance toward lethal proteotoxic and ER stress. In this chapter, we describe HDAC inhibitor-induced hyperacetylation of major chaperones and its implication for the use of HDAC inhibitors in the treatment of solid and hematologic tumors.

Histone deacetylases (HDACs) are commonly dysregulated in pancreatic adenocarcinoma (PA) and have a central role in the development and progression of the disease. HDAC is a family of enzymes involved in deacetylation of lysine residues on histone and non-histone proteins. Deacetylation of histone proteins leads to compaction of the DNA/histone complex resulting in inhibition of gene expression. Deacetylation of non-histone proteins can affect the stability and function of key proteins leading to dysregulation of cellular signaling pathways. HDAC inhibitors have been shown to potentiate the antiproliferative and proapoptotic effects of several cytotoxic agents, in vitro and in vivo PA xenograft models. The areas covered include the biology and function of the HDAC isoenzymes and their significant role in multiple oncogenic pathways in PA. Preclinical and clinical trials evaluating HDAC inhibitors are also reviewed. Despite discouraging early phase clinical trials evaluating HDAC inhibitors in PA, this strategy deserves further evaluation guided by better preclinical studies in identifying the role of specific HDAC isoenzyme inhibitors in PA. Evaluation of the effects of HDAC inhibitors on PA stem cell function and epithelial to mesenchymal transformation is also an evolving area that holds future potential for these agents. Such preclinical studies will yield insight into the functionality of HDAC isoenzymes, which can then be translated into rationally designed clinical trials. One such strategy could focus on HDAC inhibition employed in combination with proteasome inhibition targeting the aggresome pathway in PA.

Conserved chromosomal HP1 proteins capable of binding to histone H3 methylated at lysine 9 are believed to provide a dynamic platform for the recruitment and/or spreading of various regulatory proteins involved in diverse chromosomal processes. The fission yeast Schizosaccharomyces pombe HP1 family members Chp2 and Swi6 are important for heterochromatin assembly and transcriptional silencing, but their precise roles are not fully understood. Here, we show that Swi6 and Chp2 associate with histone deacetylase (HDAC) protein complexes containing class I HDAC Clr6 and class II HDAC Clr3 (a component of Snf2/HDAC repressor complex), which are critical for transcriptional silencing of centromeric repeats targeted by the heterochromatin machinery. Mapping of RNA polymerase (Pol) II distribution in single and double mutant backgrounds revealed that Swi6 and Chp2 proteins and their associated HDAC complexes have overlapping functions in limiting Pol II occupancy across pericentromeric heterochromatin domains. The purified Swi6 fraction also contains factors involved in various chromosomal processes such as chromatin remodeling and DNA replication. Also, Swi6 copurifies with Mis4 protein, a cohesin loading factor essential for sister chromatid cohesion, and with centromere-specific histone H3 variant CENP-A, which is incorporated into chromatin in a heterochromatin-dependent manner. These analyses suggest that among other functions, HP1 proteins associate with chromatin-modifying factors that in turn cooperate to assemble repressive chromatin; thus, precluding accessibility of underlying DNA sequences to transcriptional machinery.

Class I histone deacetylase (HDAC) inhibitors are believed to have positive effects on neurite outgrowth, synaptic plasticity, and neurogenesis in adult brain. However, the downstream molecular targets of class I HDAC inhibitors in neurons are not clear. Although class I HDAC inhibitors are thought to broadly promote transcription of many neuronal genes through enhancement of histone acetylation, the affected gene set may include unidentified genes that are essential for neuronal survival and function. To identify novel genes that are targets of class I HDAC inhibitors, we used a microarray to screen transcripts from neuronal cultures and evaluated changes in protein and mRNA expression following treatment with four HDAC inhibitors. We identified tescalcin (Tesc) as the most strongly up-regulated gene following treatment with class I HDAC inhibitors in neurons. Moreover, hippocampal neurons overexpressing TESC showed a greater than 5-fold increase in the total length of neurites and number of branch points compared with controls. These findings highlight a potentially important role for TESC in mediating the neuroprotective effect of class I HDAC inhibitors. TESC may also be involved in the development of brain and neurodegenerative diseases through epigenetic mechanisms.

Histone deacetylases (HDACs) influence diverse cellular processes and may contribute to tumor development and progression by multiple mechanisms. Class I HDACs are often overexpressed in cancers contributing to a genome-wide epigenetic state permitting increased proliferation, and diminished apoptosis and cell differentiation. Class IIA and IIB isoenzymes may likewise contribute to tumorigenesis as components of specific intranuclear repressor complexes or regulators of posttranslational protein modifications. As HDAC inhibitors may counteract these tumorigenic effects several of these compounds are currently tested in clinical trials. HDAC inhibitors are also considered for urothelial carcinoma, where novel therapeutic drugs are urgently required. However, only modest antineoplastic activity has been observed with isoenzyme-unspecific pan-HDAC inhibitors. Therefore, inhibition of specific HDAC isoenzymes might be more efficacious and tumor-specific. Here, we systematically review knowledge on the expression, function and suitability as therapeutic targets of the 11 classical HDACs in UC. Overall, the class I HDACs HDAC1 and HDAC2 are the most promising targets for antineoplastic treatment. In contrast, targeting HDAC8 and HDAC6 is likely to be of minor relevance in urothelial carcinoma. Class IIA HDACs like HDAC4 require further study, since their downregulation rather than upregulation could be involved in urothelial carcinoma pathogenesis.
