Bruton's tyrosine kinase (BTK) is crucial for FcεRI-mediated mast cell activation and essential for autoantibody production by B cells in chronic spontaneous urticaria (CSU). Fenebrutinib, an orally administered, potent, highly selective, reversible BTK inhibitor, may be effective in CSU. This double-blind, placebo-controlled, phase 2 trial (EudraCT ID 2016-004624-35 ) randomized 93 adults with antihistamine-refractory CSU to 50 mg daily, 150 mg daily and 200 mg twice daily of fenebrutinib or placebo for 8 weeks. The primary end point was change from baseline in urticaria activity score over 7 d (UAS7) at week 8. Secondary end points were the change from baseline in UAS7 at week 4 and the proportion of patients well-controlled (UAS7 ≤ 6) at week 8. Fenebrutinib efficacy in patients with type IIb autoimmunity and effects on IgG-anti-FcεRI were exploratory end points. Safety was also evaluated. The primary end point was met, with dose-dependent improvements in UAS7 at week 8 occurring at 200 mg twice daily and 150 mg daily, but not at 50 mg daily of fenebrutinib versus placebo. Asymptomatic, reversible grade 2 and 3 liver transaminase elevations occurred in the fenebrutinib 150 mg daily and 200 mg twice daily groups (2 patients each). Fenebrutinib diminished disease activity in patients with antihistamine-refractory CSU, including more patients with refractory type IIb autoimmunity. These results support the potential use of BTK inhibition in antihistamine-refractory CSU.

To review the published literature on current and new treatments for chronic spontaneous urticaria (CSU) and to provide guidance on the potential use of these therapeutics. A PubMed search was performed to include English-language articles with the keywords chronic spontaneous urticaria, pathophysiology, quality of life, and treatments, with a preference to those articles written in the last 5 years. ClinicalTrials.gov was reviewed for recent relevant clinical trials related to potential CSU therapeutics. Literature was included if it provided information related to the current understanding of the pathophysiology and management of CSU as well as potential novel therapeutics currently in development. CSU has a significant effect on patients' quality of life. Current therapies include antihistamines, leukotriene receptor antagonists, omalizumab, and immunosuppressants; however, additional treatments are needed. New therapeutics under investigation include IgG1 anti-IgE monoclonal antibodies (ligelizumab), chemoattractant rector-homologous molecule expressed on T<sub>H</sub>2 cells antagonists (AZD1981), Bruton tyrosine kinase inhibitors (fenebrutinib), anti-siglec-8 monoclonal antibody (AK002), and topical spleen tyrosine kinase inhibitors (GSK2646264). We review the mechanisms of action as well as recently published data from clinical trials regarding the efficacy and safety of these treatments. The development of new treatments for CSU will lead to improved options for patients and may assist with improving our understanding of disease pathophysiology.

Bruton's tyrosine kinase (Btk) is thought to play a pathogenic role in chronic immune diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis and lupus. While covalent, irreversible Btk inhibitors are approved for treatment of hematologic malignancies, they are not approved for autoimmune indications. In efforts to develop additional series of reversible Btk inhibitors for chronic immune diseases, we sought to differentiate from our clinical stage inhibitor fenebrutinib using cyclopropyl amide isosteres of the 2-aminopyridyl group to occupy the flat, lipophilic H2 pocket. While drug-like properties were retained-and in some cases improved-a safety liability in the form of hERG inhibition was observed. When a fluorocyclopropyl amide was incorporated, Btk and off-target activity was found to be stereodependent and a lead compound was identified in the form of the (<i>R</i>,<i>R</i>)- stereoisomer.

To evaluate fenebrutinib, an oral and highly selective non-covalent inhibitor of Bruton's tyrosine kinase (BTK), in patients with active rheumatoid arthritis (RA). Patients with RA and inadequate response to methotrexate (cohort 1, n=480) were randomized to fenebrutinib (50 mg once daily, 150 mg once daily, 200 mg twice daily), 40 mg adalimumab every other week, or placebo. Patients with RA and inadequate response to tumor necrosis factor inhibitors (cohort 2, n=98) received fenebrutinib (200 mg twice daily) or placebo. Both cohorts continued methotrexate therapy. In cohort 1, American College of Rheumatology scores (ACR50) at week 12 were similar for fenebrutinib 50 mg once daily and placebo, and higher for fenebrutinib 150 mg once daily (28%) and 200 mg twice daily (35%) than placebo (15%) (p=0.017; p=0.0003). Fenebrutinib 200 mg twice daily and adalimumab (36%) were comparable (p=0.81). In cohort 2, more patients achieved ACR50 with fenebrutinib 200 mg twice daily (25%) than placebo (12%) (p=0.072). The most common adverse events for fenebrutinib included nausea, headache, anemia, and upper respiratory tract infections. Fenebrutinib had significant effects on myeloid and B cell biomarkers (CCL4 and rheumatoid factor). Fenebrutinib and adalimumab caused overlapping as well as distinct changes in B cell and myeloid biomarkers. Fenebrutinib demonstrated efficacy comparable to adalimumab in patients with an inadequate response to methotrexate, and safety consistent with existing immunomodulatory therapies for RA. These data support targeting both B and myeloid cells via this novel mechanism for potential efficacy in the treatment of RA.

Bruton tyrosine kinase (Btk) is expressed in B-lymphocytes, myeloid cells and platelets, and Btk-inhibitors (BTKi) are used to treat patients with B-cell malignancies, developed against autoimmune diseases, have been proposed as novel antithrombotic drugs, and been tested in patients with severe COVID-19. However, mild bleeding is frequent in patients with B-cell malignancies treated with the irreversible BTKi ibrutinib and the recently approved 2nd generation BTKi acalabrutinib, zanubrutinib and tirabrutinib, and also in volunteers receiving in a phase-1 study the novel irreversible BTKi BI-705564. In contrast, no bleeding has been reported in clinical trials of other BTKi. These include the brain-penetrant irreversible tolebrutinib and evobrutinib (against multiple sclerosis), the irreversible branebrutinib, the reversible BMS-986142 and fenebrutinib (targeting rheumatoid arthritis and lupus erythematodes), and the reversible covalent rilzabrutinib (against pemphigus and immune thrombocytopenia). Remibrutinib, a novel highly selective covalent BTKi, is currently in clinical studies of autoimmune dermatological disorders. This review describes twelve BTKi approved or in clinical trials. By focusing on their pharmacological properties, targeted disease, bleeding side effects and actions on platelets it attempts to clarify the mechanisms underlying bleeding. Specific platelet function tests in blood might help to estimate the probability of bleeding of newly developed BTKi.

Fenebrutinib (GDC-0853), a Bruton's tyrosine kinase (BTK) inhibitor was investigated in a Phase 2 clinical trial in patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA). Our aim was to apply a model-informed drug development (MIDD) approach to examine the totality of available clinical efficacy data. Population pharmacokinetics (popPK) modeling, exposure-response (E-R) analysis, and model-based meta-analysis (MBMA) of fenebrutinib were performed based on the Phase 2 data. PopPK of fenebrutinib after oral administration was described using a 3-compartment model with linear elimination and a flexible absorption transit compartment model. Healthy subjects had a 52% higher apparent clearance than patients. E-R analyses based on longitudinal ACR20, ACR50, and ACR70 and DAS28 (CRP) data modeled fenebrutinib effect with an E<sub>max</sub> function, and an efficacy plateau was achieved within the exposure range obtained in the Phase 2 clinical trial. Based on literature data, a summary-level clinical efficacy database was constructed, and MBMA determined ACR20, ACR50, and ACR70 responder rates in the placebo and adalimumab arms of the Phase 2 clinical trial were found to be consistent with historical data for these treatments. Our multi-pronged approach applied MIDD to maximize knowledge extraction of efficacy data and enabled robust interpretation from a Phase 2 clinical trial.

Chronic urticaria (CU) is a common, heterogeneous, and debilitating disease. Antihistamines and omalizumab are the mainstay therapies of CU. Additional treatment options are needed. Here, we review the off and beyond label use of licensed drugs, novel treatments that are currently under development, and promising new targets. MEDLINE was searched for recent reports of the successful use of treatments in CU and promising targets for the development of novel treatment options. We also searched ClinicalTrials.gov for recent and ongoing randomized clinical trials in CU. Relevant articles were selected and reviewed. Omalizumab, the treatment of choice in patients with antihistamine-resistant chronic spontaneous urticaria (CSU), should be explored for use in chronic inducible urticaria in children younger than 12 years with CSU and at higher doses. The off-label use of dupilumab, reslizumab, mepolizumab, and benralizumab can be effective in CU. Ligelizumab and UB-221, 2 novel anti-IgE monoclonal antibodies, are in clinical trials for CU. Other promising drugs that are currently under development for CU are a chemoattractant receptor-homologous molecule expressed on T<sub>H</sub>2 cell antagonist, a monoclonal antibody to Siglec-8 (AK002), Bruton tyrosine kinase inhibitors (fenebrutinib and Lou064), a spleen tyrosine kinase inhibitor, and dupilumab. Promising targets of future therapies include the Mas-related G-protein-coupled receptor X2; the histamine<sub>4</sub> receptor; C5a and its receptor; inhibitory mast cell receptors other than Siglec-8; interleukin 33, interleukin 25, and thymic stromal lymphopoietin, and stem cell factor. Novel and better treatments for CU are very much needed. Some agents are in clinical trials already (eg, ligelizumab), and additional ones should be developed, making use of the many promising targets recently identified and characterized.

Fenebrutinib (GDC-0853) is a noncovalent, oral, and highly selective inhibitor of Bruton's tyrosine kinase (BTK). The efficacy, safety, and pharmacodynamics of fenebrutinib in systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) were assessed in this phase II, multicenter, randomized, placebo-controlled study. Patients who had moderately to severely active SLE while receiving background standard therapy were randomized to receive placebo, fenebrutinib 150 mg once daily, or fenebrutinib 200 mg twice daily. Glucocorticoid taper was recommended from weeks 0 to 12 and from weeks 24 to 36. The primary end point was the SLE Responder Index 4 (SRI-4) response at week 48. Patients (n = 260) were enrolled from 44 sites in 12 countries, with the majority from Latin America, the US, and Western Europe. The SRI-4 response rates at week 48 were 51% for fenebrutinib 150 mg once daily (P = 0.37 versus placebo), 52% for fenebrutinib 200 mg twice daily (P = 0.34 versus placebo), and 44% for placebo. British Isles Lupus Assessment Group-based Combined Lupus Assessment response rates at week 48 were 53% for fenebrutinib 150 mg once daily (P = 0.086 versus placebo), 42% for fenebrutinib 200 mg twice daily (P = 0.879 versus placebo), and 41% for placebo. Safety results were similar across all arms, although serious adverse events were more frequent with fenebrutinib 200 mg twice daily. By week 48, patients treated with fenebrutinib had reduced levels of a BTK-dependent plasmablast RNA signature, anti-double-stranded DNA autoantibodies, total IgG, and IgM, as well as increased complement C4 levels, all relative to placebo. While fenebrutinib had an acceptable safety profile, the primary end point, SRI-4 response, was not met despite evidence of strong pathway inhibition.

The cytoplasmic protein-tyrosine kinase BTK plays an essential role for differentiation and survival of B-lineage cells and, hence, represents a suitable drug target. The number of BTK inhibitors (BTKis) in the clinic has increased considerably and currently amounts to at least 22. First-in-class was ibrutinib, an irreversible binder forming a covalent bond to a cysteine in the catalytic region of the kinase, for which we have identified 228 active trials listed at ClinicalTrials.gov. Next-generation inhibitors, acalabrutinib and zanubrutinib, are approved both in the United States and in Europe, and zanubrutinib also in China, while tirabrutinib is currently only registered in Japan. In most cases, these compounds have been used for the treatment of B-lymphocyte tumors. However, an increasing number of trials instead addresses autoimmunity and inflammation in multiple sclerosis, rheumatoid arthritis, pemphigus and systemic lupus erythematosus with the use of either irreversibly binding inhibitors, e.g., evobrutinib and tolebrutinib, or reversibly binding inhibitors, like fenebrutinib. Adverse effects (AEs) have predominantly implicated inhibition of other kinases with a BTKi-binding cysteine in their catalytic domain. Analysis of the reported AEs suggests that ibrutinib-associated atrial fibrillation is caused by binding to ERBB2/HER2 and ERBB4/HER4. However, the binding pattern of BTKis to various additional kinases does not correlate with the common assumption that skin manifestations and diarrhoeas are off-target effects related to EGF receptor inhibition. Moreover, dermatological toxicities, diarrhoea, bleedings and invasive fungal infections often develop early after BTKi treatment initiation and subsequently subside. Conversely, cardiovascular AEs, like hypertension and various forms of heart disease, often persist.

Fenebrutinib (GDC-0853) is an orally administered small molecule inhibitor of Bruton's tyrosine kinase being investigated for treatment of rheumatoid arthritis in patients with inadequate responses to methotrexate (MTX). This study interrogated the potential for pharmacokinetic drug interactions between fenebrutinib and MTX. Eighteen healthy male subjects were enrolled in the study. They received a single oral dose of MTX (7.5 mg) on day 1 followed by a 13-day washout period. Subsequently, on days 15-20 the participants received 200 mg of fenebrutinib twice daily. On day 21, they received a 7.5 mg dose of MTX and a 200 mg dose of fenebrutinib under fasting conditions. The geometric mean ratios of MTX area under the plasma concentration-time curve (AUC) and <i>C</i> <sub>max</sub> on day 21 relative to day 1 (90% confidence interval [CI]) were 0.96 (0.88-1.04) and 1.05 (0.94-1.18), respectively. The geometric mean ratios of fenebrutinib AUC and <i>C</i> <sub>max</sub> for day 21 relative to day 20 (90% CI) were 1.03 (0.95-1.11) and 1.02 (0.90-1.15), respectively. The combination treatment was well tolerated, with an adverse event profile similar to that reported in other MTX trials. These results indicate that there is no clinically significant pharmacokinetic interaction between fenebrutinib and MTX.

Spleen tyrosine kinase (Syk) and Bruton's tyrosine kinase (BTK) play critical roles in platelet physiology, facilitating intracellular immunoreceptor tyrosine-based activation motif (ITAM)-mediated signaling downstream of platelet glycoprotein VI (GPVI) and GPIIb/IIIa receptors. Small molecule tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) targeting Syk and BTK have been developed as antineoplastic and anti-inflammatory therapeutics and have also gained interest as antiplatelet agents. Here, we investigate the effects of 12 different Syk and BTK inhibitors on GPVI-mediated platelet signaling and function. These inhibitors include four Syk inhibitors, Bay 61-3606, R406 (fostamatinib), entospletinib, TAK-659; four irreversible BTK inhibitors, ibrutinib, acalabrutinib, ONO-4059 (tirabrutinib), AVL-292 (spebrutinib); and four reversible BTK inhibitors, CG-806, BMS-935177, BMS-986195, and fenebrutinib. In vitro, TKIs targeting Syk or BTK reduced platelet adhesion to collagen, dense granule secretion, and alpha granule secretion in response to the GPVI agonist cross-linked collagen-related peptide (CRP-XL). Similarly, these TKIs reduced the percentage of activated integrin α<sub>IIb</sub>β<sub>3</sub> on the platelet surface in response to CRP-XL, as determined by PAC-1 binding. Although all TKIs tested inhibited phospholipase C γ2 (PLCγ2) phosphorylation following GPVI-mediated activation, other downstream signaling events proximal to phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K) and PKC were differentially affected. In addition, reversible BTK inhibitors had less pronounced effects on GPIIb/IIIa-mediated platelet spreading on fibrinogen and differentially altered the organization of PI3K around microtubules during platelets spreading on fibrinogen. Select TKIs also inhibited platelet aggregate formation on collagen under physiological flow conditions. Together, our results suggest that TKIs targeting Syk or BTK inhibit central platelet functional responses but may differentially affect protein activities and organization in critical systems downstream of Syk and BTK in platelets.
