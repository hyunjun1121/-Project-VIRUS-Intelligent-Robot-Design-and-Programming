IDEAL_ANSWER:
- The Fanconi anemia protein FANCA has been shown to interact with the brm-related gene 1 (BRG1) product. BRG1 is a subunit of the SWI/SNF complex, which remodels chromatin structure through a DNA-dependent ATPase activity.
- FANCA was demonstrated to associate with the endogenous SWI/SNF complexFANCA may recruit the SWI/SNF complex to target genes, thereby enabling coupled nuclear functions such as transcription and DNA repair

EXACT_ANSWER:
- BRG1
