IDEAL_ANSWER:
- A five gene type I IFN signature was assessed in these subjects to identify subpopulations showing both activation and concordance of the type I IFN pathway in the peripheral blood and disease-affected tissues of each disease and to correlate activation of this pathway in the WB with clinical measurements.R Baseline disease activity measurements correlated with a type I IFN gene signature in the WB of subjects with SLE, PM and SSc, as did various serum autoantibody levels in subjects with SLE and DM.
- Baseline disease activity measurements correlated with a type I IFN gene signature in the WB of subjects. The type I IFN signature negatively predicts the clinical response to rituximab treatment in patients with RA.
- a five gene type i ifn signature was assessed in these subjects to identify subpopulations showing both activation and concordance of the type i ifn pathway in the peripheral blood and disease-affected tissues of each disease and to correlate activation of this pathway in the wb with clinical measurements.
- A five gene type I IFN signature was assessed in these subjects to identify subpopulations showing both activation and concordance of the type I IFN pathway in the peripheral blood and disease-affected tissues of each disease and to correlate activation of this pathway in the WB with clinical measurements.R
