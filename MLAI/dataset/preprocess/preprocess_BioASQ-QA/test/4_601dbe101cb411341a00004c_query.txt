Calcitonin-gene-related peptide (CGRP) plays a key role in migraine pathophysiology. Aimovig (erenumab; erenumab-aooe in the United States) is the only US Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-approved monoclonal antibody (mAb) therapy against the CGRP receptor (CGRPR) for the prevention of migraine. Aimovig is also the first FDA-approved mAb against a G-protein-coupled receptor (GPCR). Here, we report the architecture and functional attributes of erenumab critical for its potent antagonism against CGRPR. The crystal structure of erenumab in complex with CGRPR reveals a direct ligand-blocking mechanism, enabled by a remarkable 21-residue-long complementary determining region (CDR)-H3 loop, which adopts a tyrosine-rich helix-turn tip and projects into the deep interface of the calcitonin receptor-like receptor (CLR) and RAMP1 subunits of CGRPR. Furthermore, erenumab engages with residues specific to CLR and RAMP1, providing the molecular basis for its exquisite selectivity. Such structural insights reveal the drug action mechanism of erenumab and shed light on developing antibody therapeutics targeting GPCRs.

Erenumab-aooe (erenumab, Aimovig<sup>®</sup>)-a fully human monoclonal antibody that inhibits the calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP) receptor-is approved for the prevention of migraine in adults in a number of countries. The approved monthly dosage of erenumab (70 and/or 140 mg, depending on the country) is available as a single, prefilled autoinjector for subcutaneous administration in most countries where it is approved. This study evaluated the patient-reported ease-of-use, ability to learn self-injection, confidence in performing a simulated self-injection, and ergonomics of a prefilled autoinjector device for erenumab (SureClick<sup>®</sup> autoinjector) in individuals in the US with migraine. Participants with migraine headaches, all of whom were naïve to the use of an autoinjector for migraine or another condition and CGRP therapy, were recruited from three US-based headache centers. Each participant received a supervised demonstration of the autoinjector during a 30-minute one-on-one session using a standard protocol-driven script. Participants then practiced a simulated injection into an artificial tissue pad using the autoinjector and were asked to rate their agreement with 19 statements about the device on a 5-point Likert scale (1 = completely disagree, 2 = somewhat disagree, 3 = neutral, 4 = somewhat agree, 5 = completely agree). Participants who completed the study and provided responses (n = 204) were between 21 and 85 years of age, inclusive, and 73% were female. More than 90% of the participants completely or somewhat agreed with 16/19 statements relating to the device, including ease-of-use, ability to self-inject, and confidence in using the device, with an average rating of >4.5 on the 5-point Likert scale. Participants rated the size of the device and the compactness of the device as 4.23/5 and 4.26/5, respectively. The erenumab-prefilled disposable autoinjector was consistently highly rated across categories by individuals with migraine, with an average rating of >4.5 on the 5-point Likert scale; results were consistent across the three study centers.

In 2018, the United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved Aimovig (erenumab) for the prevention of migraine. Erenumab is the first FDA approved antibody therapeutic against a G-protein-coupled receptor, the canonical receptor of calcitonin gene related peptide (CGRP-R). A novel, epitope-focused antigen was created to reconstruct the extracellular domains of the CGRP-R in a stable conformation. Successful inoculation of XenoMouse animals and careful screening yielded multiple candidate molecules for high potency and exquisite selectivity toward the CGRP-R over related receptors. These efforts led to the discovery of erenumab which has demonstrated the desired efficacy and safety profiles in multiple clinical studies for the prevention of migraine. The innovation developed in the discovery of erenumab furthers the ability to target G-coupled protein receptors using antibody approaches.

Amgen and Novartis are developing erenumab (AIMOVIG™, erenumab-aooe)-a fully human monoclonal antibody calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP) receptor antagonist-for the prevention of migraine. CGRP is a vasodilatory neuropeptide implicated in the pathophysiology of migraine and treatment with erenumab was associated with significant reductions in migraine frequency in phase II and III clinical trials. Based on these positive results erenumab was recently approved in the US for the preventive treatment of migraine in adults and has received a positive opinion in the EU for the prophylaxis of migraines in adults who have at least 4 migraine days per month. This article summarizes the milestones in the development of erenumab leading to this first approval.
