IDEAL_ANSWER:
- saf-a/hnrnp u is an abundant nuclear protein that interacts specifically with nuclear matrix attachment region dna
- SAF-A/hnRNP U is an abundant nuclear protein that interacts specifically with nuclear matrix attachment region DNA (MAR) and RNA as a component of hnRNPs. Scaffold attachment factor A (SAF-A) participates in the regulation of gene expression by organizing chromatin into transcriptionally active domains and by interacting directly with RNA polymerase II.
- Scaffold attachment factor B (SAF-B) is a nuclear matrix-associated protein. It is an abundant nuclear protein that interacts specifically with nuclear matrix attachment region DNA (MAR) and RNA as a component of hnRNPs.
- TheSAF-A protein is localized to the nuclear matrix
- SAF-A/hnRNP U is an abundant nuclear protein that interacts specifically with nuclear matrix attachment region DNA (MAR) and RNA as a component of hnRNPs. 
- The SAF-A protein localizes to the nucleus where it promotes ribosome biogenesis
- SAF-A is localized to the nucleus where it promotes ribosomal RNA (rRNA) transcription thereby stimulating cell growth.

EXACT_ANSWER:
- the nucleus
