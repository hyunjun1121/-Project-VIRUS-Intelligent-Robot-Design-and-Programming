To evaluate the effectiveness of transabdominal ultrasonography for bladder volume and detrusor muscle thickness and to research the relationship of these measurements with age, height, and body mass index. We reviewed the records of 244 healthy, school-aged children from February to May 2003. After a complete urologic examination, the weight and height of all children were measured, and their body mass index was determined. Transabdominal ultrasonography with a high-frequency probe was performed to obtain the anterior, posterior, and lateral bladder wall thicknesses. The mean age of the children was 10.7 +/- 3.6 years (range 7 to 15), and the mean bladder volume was 256 cm3 (range 78 to 790). The relationship between bladder volume and age was significant (P = 0.0001, r = 0.568). The mean anterior, posterior, and lateral detrusor thickness was 1.42 mm (range 0.8 to 2.8), 1.57 mm (range 0.7 to 3.1), and 1.49 mm (range 0.6 to 2.6), respectively. The relationships between increasing age and the anterior and posterior wall thicknesses were significant (P <0.05), but the relationship between age and the lateral wall thickness was not (P >0.05). The relationship between bladder volume and body mass index was significant (P = 0.0001, r = 0.2959). A strong positive and significant correlation was found between the anterior (P = 0.0001) and posterior (P = 0.001) wall thicknesses and body mass index, but the correlation between the lateral wall thickness and body mass index was not significant (P = 0.079, r = 0.113). Strong, positive correlations were found between the anterior and posterior wall detrusor thicknesses and increased age and body mass index, but the same correlations for lateral wall detrusor thickness were not found.

In infancy it has been reported that intravesical pressure is generally higher in males than in females. We investigated whether there are significant differences in the sonographic characteristics of the urinary tract in male and female neonates. The study comprised 280 consecutive full-term newborns, including 146 males and 134 females. Kidneys were assessed for hydronephrosis and graded according to Society for Fetal Urology guidelines. Kidney measurements included maximum longitudinal length and largest longitudinal area. Bladder measurements included bladder dimensions and wall thickness. Bladder wall thickness was measured only in neonates with an estimated bladder volume of greater than 10 ml. Of the 280 neonates 114 had mild renal pelvic dilatation in at least 1 kidney and the incidence in males was significantly higher than in females (53% versus 27%). Kidney longitudinal length and largest area were significantly greater in males on each side. Mean bladder volume was essentially equal in the 169 male and female neonates with an estimated bladder volume of greater than 10 ml. but mean bladder wall thickness was significantly greater in males than in females (1.63 versus 1.38 mm.). Our study shows that there are marked differences in sonographic findings in male and female neonates in regard to renal pelvic dilatation, renal size and bladder wall thickness. These differences should be considered when sonography is done for screening for urinary tract anomalies in newborns.

Ultrasonic measurements of urinary bladders are suitable to quantify bladder wall hypertrophy due to bladder outlet obstruction, detrusor overactivity, or neurogenic bladder dysfunction in adult men or women and in children. Quantification of bladder wall hypertrophy seems to be useful for the assessment of diseases, prediction of treatment outcomes, and longitudinal studies investigating disease development and progression. Four distinct measurement techniques have been published using bladder wall thickness (BWT), detrusor wall thickness (DWT), or ultrasound-estimated bladder weight (UEBW) assessed by suprapubic or transvaginal positioning of ultrasound probes and different bladder filling volumes. As a result, different threshold and reference values were established causing confusion. This ICI-RS report summarizes the agreements of different research groups in terms of ultrasonic BWT or DWT measurements, critically discusses the four ultrasonic measurement techniques, suggests criteria for quality control, and proposes future research activities to unify measurement strategies. For quality control, all future reports should provide information about frequency of the ultrasound probe, bladder filling volume at measurement, if BWT, DWT, or UEBW was measured, enlargement factor of the ultrasound image, and one ultrasound image with marker positioning. The ICI-RS intends to found a standardization committee that will initiate and judge studies on ultrasonic bladder wall measurements to clarify the most suitable, most accurate, and least invasive measurement technique.

OBJECTIVES To validate transperineal, transabdominal and transvaginal ultrasound (US) techniques to measure bladder wall thickness (BWT). SUBJECTS AND METHODS Women underwent US measurement of BWT at three different anatomical sites: anterior wall, dome and trigone of the bladder by two 'blinded' operators using transabdominal, transperineal and transvaginal approaches at separate visits and by a single operator using transabdominal and transperineal techniques. Bland-Altman analysis was used to determine interobserver reliability for all three techniques and intraobserver reliability for transabdominal and transperineal methods. RESULTS In all, 25 women were scanned. The transperineal US had a high interobserver mean difference when measuring the anterior BWT (-0.34) and a high intraobserver mean difference when measuring the anterior (0.54) and dome BWT (0.33). Transabdominal US had a high interobserver mean difference for all measurements of BWT, and a high intraobserver mean difference when measuring the trigonal thickness (0.56). Transvaginal US had a consistent interobserver mean difference for all three measurements. The transperineal and transabominal approaches had the widest intraobserver and interobserver 95% confidence intervals of the mean difference when compared with the transvaginal approach. CONCLUSIONS Transabdominal and transperineal US for measuring BWT did not have good intraobserver and interobserver reliability for measurement of the three anatomical sites to determine mean BWT. Transvaginal US had good interobserver reliability, thus mean BWT is best measured using the transvaginal approach.

This study aimed to evaluate the voiding characteristics of primary school children by using questionnaires and non-invasive diagnostic tools. The voiding characteristics of 212 healthy children in two primary schools were evaluated with ultrasound for bladder wall thickness (BWT) in association with the Pediatric Lower Urinary Tract Symptom Score (PLUTSS), familial questionnaire, uroflowmetry (UF) and urinalysis. Most of the children (70%) had achieved urinary and fecal continence between the ages of 18 months and 36 months. Twenty-five per cent of healthy children void fewer than four times or more than seven times per day. Ninety percent of children had a PLUTSS within normal ranges (< 9). Fifteen percent of patients had a uroflowmetric pattern other than bell-shaped. The peak and average flow rates were higher in girls. Enuresis nocturna was detected in 10% of children. None of the children had documented urinary tract infection. The average BWT from posterior wall at full bladder in healthy children was 1.1 mm. The anterior and posterior BWT measurements before and after micturition were found to be thicker in boys. Regarding the UF pattern, in post-voiding measurements in children with abnormal UF pattern, the bladder walls were thicker. Non-invasive tests in non-symptomatic children showed a range of variability, and these deviations should be kept in mind during the evaluation of voiding characteristics of a child. The symptom scoring system, with the high sensitivity and specificity rates it possesses, is one of the promising tools for this purpose.

Progressive changes in the bladder wall are observed in men with lower urinary tract obstruction secondary to benign prostatic enlargement (BPE). The high pressure voiding causes initially an increase in the proportion of smooth muscle (hyperplasia/hypertrophy of the detrusor) that develops to major changes in the advanced stages of bladder decompensationi (fibrosis), hyperactivity and decreased functional capacity. Early identification of bladder changes by noninvasive transabdominal ultrasound can suggest therapeutic choices that can prevent further organ damage in the bladder wall. Aim of our study is to review ultrasound (US) parameters, that could be considered reliable and reproducible, in order to demonstrate the damage of the bladder wall. We performed a literature review to detect reported US parameters according to our aims. Our clinical experience was evaluated in retrospective manner to detect feasibility and limitations of the evaluation of these parameters in men with different degrees of bladder damage secondary to BPE. Measurement of the bladder wall thickness (BWT) or detrusor wall thickness (DWT) by US is reliable, with at least 3 measurements of the anterior bladder wall taken at a filling volume of 250 ml. In particular, the DWT [thickness of the hypoechoic muscle between two hyperechoic layers corresponding to serosa and mucosa] is considered the best diagnostic tool to measure detrusor hypertrophy using cut-off value > 2.9 mm in men. US derived measurements of bladder weight (Estimated Bladder Weight, EBW) is another noninvasive tool for assessing bladder modifications in patients with bladder outlet obstruction (BOO) with a cut-off value of 35 gr. Technique for measuring the BWT and EBW relies on conventional US 7.5-4 MHz using the automatic system of computation (BVM 6500 3.7 MHz). The variability of intra-operator (4.6 to 5.1%) and interoperator measurements (12.3%) is acceptable. Also conventional US detects established signs of bladder damage: diverticulosis, trabecolations in the bladder wall (pseudo-diverticula), calculi and post-void residual urine (PVR) (> 50 cc). Furthermore the Intravescical Prostate Protrusion (IPP), easy measured by transabdominal ultrasound, is strongly correlated to obstruction in men with BPE (cut-off 12 mm). Measurement, scoring and monitoring of the cervico-urethral obstruction in men with symptomatic BPE is possible by the non-invasive US of the bladder wall. Early identification by measuring DWTand EBW in addition to established US paremeters has the advantage of suggest the adoption of therapeutic measures sufficient to prevent progression of bladder damage. US derived measurements of DWT and EBW are reproducible and reliable. Transabdominal US also detect established bladder damage such as diverticula, stones and PVR, while IPP measurement seems to be correlated to BOO. US bladder parameters are considered potential noninvasive clinical tools for baseline assessment of patients with BOO. In particular noninvasive US parameters could be useful for longitudinal studies monitoring men with lower urinary tract obstruction secondary to BPE.

To identify measurements of ultrasonography (US)-derived bladder wall thickness (BWT) and bladder weight in community-dwelling men with presumably normal bladder function. A total of 100 male volunteers underwent transabdominal US measurements of BWT and bladder weight, using the BVM 9500 bladder scanner (Verathon Medical, Bothell, WA, USA), at a variety of bladder filling volumes. The data were explored for any correlation between measurements of BWT and US-estimated bladder weight (UEBW) with subject age, height, weight, body mass index (BMI), International Consultation on Incontinence Questionnaire-Male Lower Urinary Tract Symptoms (ICIQ M-LUTS) score, International Prostate Symptom Score (IPSS) and IPSS Quality of Life index (IPSS QoL). Several statistically significant but weak correlations were observed: BWT and weight (r = 0.216, P = 0.032); BWT and BMI (r = 0.246, P = 0.014); UEBW and weight (r = 0.304, P = 0.002); and UEBW and BMI (r = 0.260, P = 0.009). Bladder filling volume appeared to have a greater effect on BWT than on UEBW, although this could not be determined accurately. There was a substantial difference in measurements of BWT and UEBW in the assessment of inter- and intra-observer reliability testing. Further studies are required to validate automated measurements of BWT and UEBW and to investigate such measurements in the symptomatic and asymptomatic male population.

There is evidence that increased bladder wall thickness can be a useful parameter in the evaluation of men with clinical benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH). However, normal values for bladder wall thickness (BWT) in adults have not been established. BWT was measured by suprapubic ultrasonography. Bladder volume was calculated as the product of the ultrasonographic measurements of bladder height, width and depth, and a correction factor (0.6). Three groups were assessed: men with normal lower urinary tracts (n = 172; mean age, 39.9), women with normal lower urinary tracts (n = 166; mean age, 37.8), and men with mild lower urinary tract symptoms (LUTS) and clinical benign prostatic enlargement (BPE) (n = 150; mean age, 66.4). For the whole group of men and women with normal bladders, mean BWT was 3.35 mm, and BWT appeared normally distributed. There were a weak negative correlation with bladder volume (r = -0.12, P < 0.003) and a weak positive correlation for BWT and age for both men (r = 0.12, P < 0.014) and women (r = 0.17, P < 0.013). Mean BWT was 3.04 mm in healthy women, 3.33 mm in healthy men, and 3.67 mm in men with LUTS and BPE. Sub-dividing normal men into different age groups showed an increasing mean BWT of 3.08 mm (<20 years, n = 27), 3.25 mm (21-40 years, n = 75), 3.42 mm (41-60 years, n = 39), and 3.57 mm (>60 years, n = 31) for those sub-groups. BWT in normal adult women is 3.0 +/- 1 mm and 3.3 +/- 1. 1 mm in normal adult men. A small increase in BWT with age is seen for both genders, and BWT tends to be greater in men than in women. Men with LUTS and BPE show a moderate increase in BWT. Adjustments for bladder volume are for practical purposes negligible, although there is a small decrease in BWT with increasing volume.

To estimate the bladder weight by automated ultrasound method (BladderScan BVM 9500) in adult females without lower urinary tract symptoms and to assess both the intra-observer and interobserver reproducibility of this method. Healthy volunteers were recruited in King Khalid University Hospital from hospital staff and patients attending the gynecological clinic over a period of six months. All women were screened for any lower urinary tract symptoms using a validated short version of Urinary Distress Inventory questionnaire. BladderScan BVM 9500 device (Diagnostic Ultrasound, Bothell, WA) was used to measure bladder wall thickness, bladder volume, and calculated bladder weight. Eighty-five women were included in the study. The mean age was 37.5 years (± 11.1). Mean bladder wall thickness (BWT) was 1.68 mm (95% confidence interval: 1.61 to 1.75) and the mean ultrasound-estimated bladder weight (UEBW) was 32.25 g (95% confidence interval: 31.7 to 32.8). The UEBW intra-observer (ICC: 0.81) and interobserver (ICC: 0.8) reproducibility were excellent while intra-observer (ICC: 0.55) and interobserver (ICC: 0.6) reproducibility for BWT were moderate. No correlation was found between UEBW and age, height, body weight, or bladder volume. The estimated bladder weight by automated ultrasound device in asymptomatic adult females yields reproducible measurements and can be used as a reference for future understanding of the changes in bladder weight related to different types of urinary incontinence or voiding disorders.

To compare repeatability and agreement of conventional ultrasound bladder wall thickness (BWT) measurements with automatically obtained BWT measurements by the BVM 6500 device. Adult patients with lower urinary tract symptoms, urinary incontinence, or postvoid residual urine were urodynamically assessed. During two subsequent cystometry sessions the infusion pump was temporarily stopped at 150 and 250 ml bladder filling to measure BWT with conventional ultrasound and the BVM 6500 device. For each method and each bladder filling, repeatability and variation was assessed by the method of Bland and Altman. Fifty unselected patients (30 men, 20 women) aged 21–86 years (median 62.5 years) were prospectively evaluated. Invalid BWT measurements were encountered in 2.1–14% of patients when using the BVM 6500 versus 0% with conventional ultrasound (significant only during the second measurement at 150 ml bladder filling). Mean difference in BWT values between the measurements of one technique was −0.1 to +0.01 mm. Measurement variation between replicate measurements was smaller for conventional ultrasound and the smallest for 250 ml bladder filling. Mean difference between the two techniques was 0.11–0.23 mm and did not differ significantly. The BVM 6500 device was not able to correctly measure BWTs above 4 mm. Both BWT measurements are repeatable and agree with each other. However, conventional ultrasound measurements have a smaller measurement variance, can measure BWT in all patients, and BWTs above 4 mm.

This manuscript reviews the information that became available over the last 12 months on the measurement of bladder/detrusor wall thickness and ultrasound-estimated bladder weight in patients with benign prostatic enlargement. The subject is of particular interest because novel technological developments may help to standardize and automate the measurement technique. Preliminary data on the automatic measurement of bladder wall thickness were reported, suggesting a good repeatability and agreement with conventional ultrasound imaging, although variance is higher than with conventional ultrasound, and thicknesses above 4 mm were not measured correctly. Some controversies emerged in the most recent peer-review literature on the possibility to diagnose bladder outlet obstruction and detrusor overactivity by measuring bladder wall thickness, and this certainly pleaded for further collaborative research and standardization. Preliminary results from new technological developments suggest a very accurate measure of bladder volume and good repeatability of bladder wall and bladder weight measurements. After a decade of research, automated measurement of bladder is here to stay. Standardization of bladder wall and weight measurement will allow better understanding of the physiopathology of detrusor hypertrophy in lower urinary tract dysfunction and possibly provide useful prognosticator indexes for our daily practice.

We investigated the correlations between ultrasonographic bladder wall thickness and urodynamic parameters, and estimated the diagnostic accuracy of bladder wall thickness for predicting unfavorable urodynamic patterns in children with myelodysplasia. A total of 57 children (median age 5.1 years) with myelodysplasia were enrolled in the study. All children underwent ultrasonography to measure bladder wall thickness. Videourodynamic evaluation was also performed within 3 months of ultrasound assessment. Bladder wall thickness was compared to urodynamic data. A urodynamic risk of upper urinary tract deterioration was defined as maximum detrusor pressure greater than 40 cm H(2)O during filling or at leakage, or sphincter dyssynergia during voiding. Bladder wall thickness was significantly correlated to detrusor leak point pressure, maximum amplitude of detrusor overactivity and maximum detrusor pressure during storage phase. In 16 children who had unfavorable urodynamic risk patterns the mean bladder wall thickness was 3.9 +/- 1.0 mm, compared to 2.4 +/- 0.7 mm in 41 patients with favorable urodynamic patterns. There was a significant difference between bladder wall thickness in children with and those without urodynamic risk factors (p <0.001). For a diagnosis of unfavorable urodynamic patterns bladder wall thickness greater than 3.3 mm had a positive predictive value of 85.7%, a negative predictive value of 90.7%, specificity of 75.0% and sensitivity of 95.1%. Receiver operator characteristic analysis revealed that bladder wall thickness had a high predictive value for unfavorable urodynamic patterns, with an area under the curve of 0.908. Ultrasonographic assessment of bladder wall thickness is a sensitive screening tool for the diagnosis of urodynamic risk factors for upper urinary tract deterioration in children with myelodysplasia.

To develop and evaluate a new clinical method for measuring bladder wall tension (BWT) on detrusor contraction during physiological voiding and under pathological conditions, as in experimental trials during subvesical obstruction the ability to generate pressure increases, whereas the contractile force per cross-sectional area of detrusor muscle decreases. In all, 24 patients were divided into three equal groups: group 1 (mean age 58, sd 8.6 years) comprised men with bladder outlet obstruction in accordance with the Abrams-Griffiths nomogram; group 2 (four men and four women, 56, sd 7.2 years) had detrusor instability; and group 3 (54, sd 9.6 years) had normal bladder emptying. BWT, as the detrusor force per cross-sectional area of bladder tissue (in N/cm2), was calculated after a urodynamic evaluation and ultrasonographic estimate of bladder wall thickness. In all patients it was possible to measure BWT; the mean (sd) maximum BWT in group 1 was 9.8 (3.9) N/cm2, in group 2 during bladder instability was 11.7 (2.6) N/cm2 and in group 3 was 2.8 (0.5) N/cm2. Estimating BWT in humans is possible by combining a urodynamic evaluation with an ultrasonographic estimate of bladder wall thickness. Further clinical research should elucidate the clinical relevance of BWT under comparable conditions.

To determine whether transvaginal ultrasound measurement of bladder wall thickness can be used as a screening test for detrusor instability in women with urinary symptoms. A blinded prospective study. A London teaching hospital. One hundred and eight-four symptomatic women presenting to a urodynamic clinic. The detection of detrusor instability by means of videocystourethrography (VCU) and ambulatory urodynamics in women with a mean bladder wall thickness of greater than 5 mm measured by transvaginal ultrasound. One hundred and eight women had a mean bladder wall thickness of greater than 5 mm. Ninety-four percent (102) of these women had detrusor instability either when undergoing VCU or ambulatory urodynamics. Seventeen women had a bladder wall thickness of less than 3.5 mm of whom three were found to have detrusor instability on VCU. The measurement of a mean bladder wall thickness greater than 5 mm with transvaginal ultrasound is a sensitive screening method for diagnosing detrusor instability in symptomatic women without outflow obstruction.
