New immunotherapeutic strategies are needed to induce effective antitumor immunity in all cancer patients. Malignant mesothelioma is characterized by a poor prognosis and resistance to conventional therapies. Infiltration of tumor-associated macrophages (TAM) is prominent in mesothelioma and is linked to immune suppression, angiogenesis, and tumor aggressiveness. Therefore, TAM depletion could potentially reactivate antitumor immunity. We show that M-CSFR inhibition using the CSF-1R kinase inhibitor PLX3397 (pexidartinib) effectively reduced numbers of TAMs, circulating nonclassical monocytes, as well as amount of neoangiogenesis and ascites in mesothelioma mouse models, but did not improve survival. When combined with dendritic cell vaccination, survival was synergistically enhanced with a concomitant decrease in TAMs and an increase in CD8<sup>+</sup> T-cell numbers and functionality. Total as well as tumor antigen-specific CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells in tumor tissue of mice treated with combination therapy showed reduced surface expression of the programmed cell death protein-1 (PD-1), a phenomenon associated with T-cell exhaustion. Finally, mice treated with combination therapy were protected from tumor rechallenge and displayed superior T-cell memory responses. We report that decreasing local TAM-mediated immune suppression without immune activation does not improve survival. However, combination of TAM-mediated immune suppression with dendritic cell immunotherapy generates robust and durable antitumor immunity. These findings provide insights into the interaction between immunotherapy-induced antitumor T cells and TAMs and offer a therapeutic strategy for mesothelioma treatment. <i>Cancer Immunol Res; 5(7); 535-46. ©2017 AACR</i>.

Tenosynovial giant cell tumour (TGCT), a rare, locally aggressive neoplasm, overexpresses colony-stimulating factor 1 (CSF1). Surgery is standard with no approved systemic therapy. We aimed to evaluate pexidartinib, a CSF1 receptor inhibitor, in patients with TGCT to provide them with a viable systemic treatment option, especially in cases that are not amenable to surgical resection. This phase 3 randomised trial had two parts. Part one was a double-blind study in which patients with symptomatic, advanced TGCT for whom surgery was not recommended were randomly assigned via an integrated web response system (1:1) to the pexidartinib or placebo group. Individuals in the pexidartinib group received a loading dose of 1000 mg pexidartinib per day orally (400 mg morning; 600 mg evening) for the first 2 weeks, followed by 800 mg per day (400 mg twice a day) for 22 weeks. Part two was an open-label study of pexidartinib for all patients. The primary endpoint, assessed in all intention-to-treat patients, was overall response at week 25, and was centrally reviewed by RECIST, version 1.1. Safety was analysed in all patients who received at least one dose of the study drug. This study is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT02371369. Between May 11, 2015, and Sept 30, 2016, of 174 patients assessed for eligibility, 120 patients were randomly assigned to, and received, pexidartinib (n=61) or placebo (n=59). There were 11 dropouts in the placebo group and nine in the pexidartinib group. Emergence of mixed or cholestatic hepatotoxicity caused the data monitoring committee to stop enrolment six patients short of target. The proportion of patients who achieved overall response was higher for pexidartinib than placebo at week 25 by RECIST (24 [39%] of 61 vs none of 59; absolute difference 39% [95% CI 27-53]; p<0·0001). Serious adverse events occurred in eight (13%) of 61 patients in the pexidartinib group and one (2%) of 59 patients in the placebo group. Hair colour changes (67%), fatigue (54%), aspartate aminotransferase increase (39%), nausea (38%), alanine aminotransferase increase (28%), and dysgeusia (25%) were the most frequent pexidartinib-associated adverse events. Three patients given pexidartinib had aminotransferase elevations three or more times the upper limit of normal with total bilirubin and alkaline phosphatase two or more times the upper limit of normal indicative of mixed or cholestatic hepatotoxicity, one lasting 7 months and confirmed by biopsy. Pexidartinib is the first systemic therapy to show a robust tumour response in TGCT with improved patient symptoms and functional outcomes; mixed or cholestatic hepatotoxicity is an identified risk. Pexidartinib could be considered as a potential treatment for TGCT associated with severe morbidity or functional limitations in cases not amenable to improvement with surgery. Daiichi Sankyo.

To evaluate the safety, recommended phase II dose (RP2D) and efficacy of pexidartinib, a colony stimulating factor receptor 1 (CSF-1R) inhibitor, in combination with weekly paclitaxel in patients with advanced solid tumors. In part 1 of this phase Ib study, 24 patients with advanced solid tumors received escalating doses of pexidartinib with weekly paclitaxel (80 mg/m<sup>2</sup>). Pexidartinib was administered at 600 mg/day in cohort 1. For subsequent cohorts, the dose was increased by ⩽50% using a standard 3+3 design. In part 2, 30 patients with metastatic solid tumors were enrolled to examine safety, tolerability and efficacy of the RP2D. Pharmacokinetics and biomarkers were also assessed. A total of 51 patients reported ≥1 adverse event(s) (AEs) that were at least possibly related to either study drug. Grade 3-4 AEs, including anemia (26%), neutropenia (22%), lymphopenia (19%), fatigue (15%), and hypertension (11%), were recorded in 38 patients (70%). In part 1, no maximum tolerated dose was achieved and 1600 mg/day was determined to be the RP2D. Of 38 patients evaluable for efficacy, 1 (3%) had complete response, 5 (13%) partial response, 13 (34%) stable disease, and 17 (45%) progressive disease. No drug-drug interactions were found. Plasma CSF-1 levels increased 1.6- to 53-fold, and CD14dim/CD16+ monocyte levels decreased by 57-100%. The combination of pexidartinib and paclitaxel was generally well tolerated. RP2D for pexidartinib was 1600 mg/day. Pexidartinib blocked CSF-1R signaling, indicating potential for mitigating macrophage tumor infiltration.

Tenosynovial giant cell tumor (TGCT) is a rare benign tumor that involves the synovium, bursa, and tendon sheath, resulting in reduced mobility of the affected joint or limb. The current standard of care for TGCT is surgical resection. However, some patients have tumor recurrence, present with unresectable tumors, or have tumors that are in locations where resection could result in amputations or significant debility. Therefore, the development of systemic agents with activity against TGCT to expand treatment options is a highly unmet medical need. Pathologically, TGCT is characterized by the overexpression of colony﻿-stimulating factor 1 (CSF-1), which leads to the recruitment of colony﻿-stimulating factor-1 receptor (CSF-1R) expressing macrophages that make up the primary cell type within these giant cell tumors. The binding of CSF-1 and CSF-1R controls cell survival and proliferation of monocytes and the switch from a monocytic to macrophage phenotype contributing to the growth and inflammation within these tumors. Therefore, molecules that target CSF-1/CSF-1R have emerged as potential systemic agents for the treatment of TGCT. Given the role of macrophages in regulating tumorigenesis, CSF1/CSF1R-targeting agents have emerged as attractive therapeutic targets for solid tumors. Pexidartinib is an orally bioavailable and potent inhibitor of CSF-1R which is one of the most clinically used agents. In this review, we discuss the biology of TGCT and review the pre-clinical and clinical development of pexidartinib which ultimately led to the FDA approval of this agent for the treatment of TGCT as well as ongoing clinical studies utilizing pexidartinib in the setting of cancer.

Tenosynovial giant cell tumor (TGCT) is a benign clonal neoplastic proliferation arising from the synovium often causing pain, swelling, joint stiffness, and reduced quality of life. The optimal treatment strategy in patients with diffuse-type TGCT (dt-TGCT) is evolving. Surgery is the main treatment, with a high recurrence rate and surgery-related morbidity. Radiotherapy is associated with important side effects. TGCT cells overexpress colony-stimulating factor 1 (CSF1). Pexidartinib (Turalio™) is a selective CSF1 R inhibitor, which was recently approved by the FDA for the treatment of TGCT. This article reviews the pharmacological properties, clinical efficacy, and safety of pexidartinib. Pexidartinib was effective with an acceptable safety profile for advanced TGCT in phase I-III studies. The phase III trial (ENLIVEN) in unresectable TGCT met its primary endpoints of overall response rate. These results led to FDA approval for this TGCT population. Mixed or cholestatic hepatotoxicity was observed in rare cases. For this reason, pexidartinib is currently available only through a Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategy (REMS) Program in the USA. TGCT significantly impairs patients' quality of life. The approval of pexidartinib has changed the therapeutic armamentarium for this condition. However, strict monitoring of liver function is warranted.

Because genetic alterations including mutations, overexpression, translocations, and dysregulation of protein kinases are involved in the pathogenesis of many illnesses, this enzyme family is currently the subject of many drug discovery programs in the pharmaceutical industry. The US FDA approved four small molecule protein kinase antagonists in 2019; these include entrectinib, erdafitinib, pexidartinib, and fedratinib. Entrectinib binds to TRKA/B/C and ROS1 and is prescribed for the treatment of solid tumors with NTRK fusion proteins and for ROS1-postive non-small cell lung cancers. Erdafitinib inhibits fibroblast growth factor receptors 1-4 and is used in the treatment of urothelial bladder cancers. Pexidartinib is a CSF1R antagonist that is prescribed for the treatment of tenosynovial giant cell tumors. Fedratinib blocks JAK2 and is used in the treatment of myelofibrosis. Overall, the US FDA has approved 52 small molecule protein kinase inhibitors, nearly all of which are orally effective with the exceptions of temsirolimus (which is given intravenously) and netarsudil (an eye drop). Of the 52 approved drugs, eleven inhibit protein-serine/threonine protein kinases, two are directed against dual specificity protein kinases, eleven target non-receptor protein-tyrosine kinases, and 28 block receptor protein-tyrosine kinases. The data indicate that 46 of these drugs are used in the treatment of neoplastic diseases (eight against non-solid tumors such as leukemias and 41 against solid tumors including breast and lung cancers; some drugs are used against both tumor types). Eight drugs are employed in the treatment of non-malignancies: fedratinib, myelofibrosis; ruxolitinib, myelofibrosis and polycythemia vera; fostamatinib, chronic immune thrombocytopenia; baricitinib, rheumatoid arthritis; sirolimus, renal graft vs. host disease; nintedanib, idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis; netarsudil, glaucoma; and tofacitinib, rheumatoid arthritis, Crohn disease, and ulcerative colitis. Moreover, sirolimus and ibrutinib are used for the treatment of both neoplastic and non-neoplastic diseases. Entrectinib and larotrectinib are tissue-agnostic anti-cancer small molecule protein kinase inhibitors. These drugs are prescribed for the treatment of any solid cancer harboring NTRK1/2/3 fusion proteins regardless of the organ, tissue, anatomical location, or histology type. Of the 52 approved drugs, seventeen are used in the treatment of more than one disease. Imatinib, for example, is approved for the treatment of eight disparate disorders. The most common drug targets of the approved pharmaceuticals include BCR-Abl, B-Raf, vascular endothelial growth factor receptors (VEGFR), epidermal growth factor receptors (EGFR), and ALK. Most of the approved small molecule protein kinase antagonists (49) bind to the protein kinase domain and six of them bind covalently. In contrast, everolimus, temsirolimus, and sirolimus are larger molecules (MW ≈ 1000) that bind to FK506 binding protein-12 (FKBP-12) to generate a complex that inhibits the mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) protein kinase complex. This review presents the physicochemical properties of all of the FDA-approved small molecule protein kinase inhibitors. Twenty-two of the 52 drugs have molecular weights greater than 500, exceeding a Lipinski rule of five criterion. Excluding the macrolides (everolimus, sirolimus, temsirolimus), the average molecular weight of the approved drugs is 480 with a range of 306 (ruxolitinib) to 615 (trametinib). More than half of the antagonists (29) have lipophilic efficiency values of less than five while the recommended optima range from 5 to 10. One of the troublesome problems with both targeted and cytotoxic drugs in the treatment of malignant diseases is the near universal development of resistance to every therapeutic modality.

Background Pexidartinib, a novel, orally administered small-molecule tyrosine kinase inhibitor, has strong selectivity against colony-stimulating factor 1 receptor. This phase I, nonrandomized, open-label multiple-dose study evaluated pexidartinib safety and efficacy in Asian patients with symptomatic, advanced solid tumors. Materials and Methods Patients received pexidartinib: cohort 1, 600 mg/d; cohort 2, 1000 mg/d for 2 weeks, then 800 mg/d. Primary objectives assessed pexidartinib safety and tolerability, and determined the recommended phase 2 dose; secondary objectives evaluated efficacy and pharmacokinetic profile. Results All 11 patients (6 males, 5 females; median age 64, range 23-82; cohort 1 n = 3; cohort 2 n = 8) experienced at least one treatment-emergent adverse event; 5 experienced at least one grade ≥ 3 adverse event, most commonly (18%) for each of the following: increased aspartate aminotransferase, blood alkaline phosphatase, gamma-glutamyl transferase, and anemia. Recommended phase 2 dose was 1000 mg/d for 2 weeks and 800 mg/d thereafter. Pexidartinib exposure, area under the plasma concentration-time curve from zero to 8 h (AUC<sub>0-8h</sub>), and maximum observed plasma concentration (C<sub>max</sub>) increased on days 1 and 15 with increasing pexidartinib doses, and time at C<sub>max</sub> (T<sub>max</sub>) was consistent throughout all doses. Pexidartinib exposure and plasma levels of adiponectin and colony-stimulating factor 1 increased following multiple daily pexidartinib administrations. One patient (13%) with tenosynovial giant cell tumor showed objective tumor response. Conclusions This was the first study to evaluate pexidartinib in Asian patients with advanced solid tumors. Pexidartinib was safe and tolerable in this population at the recommended phase 2 dose previously determined for Western patients (funded by Daiichi Sankyo; clinicaltrials.gov number, NCT02734433).

Pexidartinib (TURALIO™) is an orally administered small molecule tyrosine kinase inhibitor with selective activity against the colony-stimulating factor 1 (CSF1) receptor, KIT proto-oncogene receptor tyrosine kinase (KIT) and FMS-like tyrosine kinase 3 harboring an internal tandem duplication mutation (FLT3-ITD). In August 2019, the US FDA approved pexidartinib capsules for the treatment of adult patients with symptomatic tenosynovial giant cell tumor (TGCT) associated with severe morbidity or functional limitations and not amenable to improvement with surgery. This approval was based on positive results from the phase III ENLIVEN trial. Pexidartinib is being investigated in various malignancies as monotherapy or combination therapy. This article summarizes the milestones in the development of pexidartinib leading to its first approval for TGCT.

Excessive adipose tissue macrophage accumulation in obesity has been implicated in mediating inflammatory responses that impair glucose homeostasis and promote insulin resistance. Colony-stimulating factor 1 (CSF1) controls macrophage differentiation, and here we sought to determine the effect of a CSF1 receptor inhibitor, PLX3397, on adipose tissue macrophage levels and understand the impact on glucose homeostasis in mice. A Ten-week-old mice were fed a chow or high-fat diet for 10 weeks and then treated with PLX3397 via oral gavage (50 mg/kg) every second day for 3 weeks, with subsequent monitoring of glucose tolerance, insulin sensitivity and assessment of adipose tissue immune cells. PLX3397 treatment substantially reduced macrophage numbers in adipose tissue of both chow and high-fat diet fed mice without affecting total myeloid cell levels. Despite this, PLX3397 did not greatly alter glucose homeostasis, did not affect high-fat diet-induced increases in visceral fat cytokine expression (Il-6 and Tnfa) and had limited effect on the phosphorylation of the stress kinases JNK and ERK and macrophage polarization. Our results indicate that macrophage infiltration of adipose tissue induced by a high-fat diet may not be the trigger for impairments in whole body glucose homeostasis, and that anti-CSF1 therapies are not likely to be useful as treatments for insulin resistance.

Simultaneously targeting the tumor and tumor microenvironment may hold promise in treating children with refractory solid tumors. Pexidartinib, an oral inhibitor of tyrosine kinases including colony stimulating factor 1 receptor (CSF-1R), KIT, and FLT3, is FDA approved in adults with tenosynovial giant cell tumor. A phase I trial was conducted in pediatric and young adult patients with refractory leukemias or solid tumors including neurofibromatosis type 1-related plexiform neurofibromas. A rolling six design with dose levels (DL) of 400 mg/m<sup>2</sup>, 600 mg/m<sup>2</sup>, and 800 mg/m<sup>2</sup> once daily for 28-day cycles (C) was used. Response was assessed at regular intervals. Pharmacokinetics and population pharmacokinetics were analyzed during C1. Twelve patients (4 per DL, 9 evaluable) enrolled on the dose-escalation phase and 4 patients enrolled in the expansion cohort: median (lower, upper quartile) age 16 (14, 16.5) years. No dose-limiting toxicities were observed. Pharmacokinetics appeared linear over three DLs. Pharmacokinetic modeling and simulation determined a weight-based recommended phase II dose (RP2D). Two patients had stable disease and 1 patient with peritoneal mesothelioma (C49+) had a sustained partial response (67% RECIST reduction). Pharmacodynamic markers included a rise in plasma macrophage CSF (MCSF) levels and a decrease in absolute monocyte count. Pexidartinib in pediatric patients was well tolerated at all DL tested, achieved target inhibition, and resulted in a weight-based RPD2 dose.

The combination of pexidartinib and binimetinib was safe and tolerable and demonstrated encouraging signs of efficacy in two patients with advanced gastrointestinal stromal tumor (GIST) refractory to tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs).Molecular profiling of GISTs at diagnosis and upon progression may provide insight into the mechanisms of response or resistance to targeted therapies.Additional trials are needed to further explore combined KIT and MEK inhibition in treatment-naïve and TKI-refractory patients with advanced GIST. Nearly all patients with advanced gastrointestinal stromal tumor (GIST) develop resistance to imatinib, and subsequent treatments have limited efficacy. Dual inhibition of KIT and MAPK pathways has synergistic antitumor activity in preclinical GIST models. This was an investigator-initiated, phase I, dose escalation study of the MEK inhibitor binimetinib combined with pexidartinib, a potent inhibitor of CSF1R, KIT, and FLT3, in patients with advanced or metastatic GIST who progressed on imatinib. The primary endpoint was phase II dose determination; secondary endpoints included safety, tolerability, and efficacy. An expansion cohort to further evaluate safety and efficacy was planned. Two patients were treated at dose level one (binimetinib 30 mg b.i.d. and pexidartinib 400 mg every morning and 200 mg every evening), after which the study was terminated by the manufacturer. No dose-limiting toxicities (DLTs) were reported, and treatment was well tolerated. The only grade ≥3 treatment-emergent adverse event (TEAE) was asymptomatic elevated creatine phosphokinase (CPK). Both patients had a best response of stable disease (SD) by RECIST. Progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS) were 6.1 and 14.6 months, respectively, in one patient with five prior lines of therapy. The second patient with <i>NF1</i>-mutant GIST had a 27% decrease in tumor burden by RECIST and remains on study after 19 months of treatment. Pexidartinib combined with binimetinib was tolerable, and meaningful clinical activity was observed in two imatinib-refractory patients.

Pexidartinib (PLX3397) is a small molecule tyrosine kinase and colony-stimulating factor-1 inhibitor with FDA breakthrough therapy designation for tenosynovial giant-cell tumor, and currently under study in several other tumor types, including breast cancer, non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, and glioblastoma. Here, we report a case of severe drug-induced liver injury requiring liver transplantation due to vanishing bile duct syndrome (VBDS) after exposure to pexidartinib in the I-SPY 2 Trial, a phase 2 multicenter randomized neoadjuvant chemotherapy trial in patients with Stage II-III breast cancer. We also review the current literature on this rare, idiosyncratic, and potentially life-threatening entity.

Huntington's disease is associated with a reactive microglial response and consequent inflammation. To address the role of these cells in disease pathogenesis, we depleted microglia from R6/2 mice, a rapidly progressing model of Huntington's disease marked by behavioural impairment, mutant huntingtin (mHTT) accumulation, and early death, through colony-stimulating factor 1 receptor inhibition (CSF1Ri) with pexidartinib (PLX3397) for the duration of disease. Although we observed an interferon gene signature in addition to downregulated neuritogenic and synaptic gene pathways with disease, overt inflammation was not evident by microglial morphology or cytokine transcript levels in R6/2 mice. Nonetheless, CSF1Ri-induced microglial elimination reduced or prevented disease-related grip strength and object recognition deficits, mHTT accumulation, astrogliosis, and striatal volume loss, the latter of which was not associated with reductions in cell number but with the extracellular accumulation of chondroitin sulphate proteoglycans (CSPGs)-a primary component of glial scars. A concurrent loss of proteoglycan-containing perineuronal nets was also evident in R6/2 mice, and microglial elimination not only prevented this but also strikingly increased perineuronal nets in the brains of naïve littermates, suggesting a new role for microglia as homeostatic regulators of perineuronal net formation and integrity.

Pexidartinib (PLX3397) is a colony-stimulating factor-1 receptor (CSF-1R) inhibitor under clinical evaluation for potential CNS tumor treatment. This study aims to evaluate plasma pharmacokinetic parameters and estimate CNS penetrance of pexidartinib in a non-human primate (NHP) cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) reservoir model. Five male rhesus macaques, each with a previously implanted subcutaneous CSF ventricular reservoir and central venous lines, were used. NHPs received a single dose of 40 mg/kg pexidartinib (human equivalent dose of 800 mg/m<sup>2</sup>), administered orally as 200 mg tablets. Serial paired samples of blood and CSF were collected at 0-8, 24, 48, and 72 h. Pexidartinib concentrations were assayed by Integrated Analytical Solutions, Inc. (Berkeley, CA, USA) using HPLC/MS/MS. Pharmacokinetic (PK) analysis was performed using noncompartmental methods. Samples from four NHPs were evaluable. Average (± SD) plasma PK parameters were as follows: C<sub>max</sub> = 16.50 (± 6.67) μg/mL; T<sub>max</sub> = 5.00 (± 2.58) h; AUC<sub>last</sub> = 250.25 (± 103.76) h*μg/mL; CL = 0.18 (± 0.10) L/h/kg. In CSF, pexidartinib was either quantifiable (n = 2), with C<sub>max</sub> values of 16.1 and 10.1 ng/mL achieved 2-4 h after plasma T<sub>max</sub>, or undetected at all time points (n = 2, LLOQ<sub>CSF</sub> = 5 ng/mL). Pexidartinib was well-tolerated in NHPs, with no Grade 3 or Grade 4 toxicities. The CSF penetration of pexidartinib after single-dose oral administration to NHPs was limited.

Tenosynovial giant cell tumor is a rare proliferative tumor that arises from the synovium, bursae, or tendon sheaths due to an overproduction of colony-stimulating factor 1. Historically, treatment options for patients with local or diffuse tenosynovial giant cell tumor have been limited to surgical interventions. However, for some patients, surgical resection could worsen functional limitations and/or morbidity. In August 2019, the FDA approved pexidartinib (TURALIO™, Daiichi Sankyo), the first systemic treatment option for adult patients with symptomatic tenosynovial giant cell tumor associated with severe morbidity or functional limitations that were not amenable to improvement with surgery. Pexidartinib is an oral tyrosine kinase inhibitor with selective inhibition of colony-stimulating factor 1 receptor and is the first systemic therapy to show significant improvement in overall response rates when compared with placebo. Clinicians using pexidartinib should monitor for liver-related adverse events, which may require treatment interruption, dose reduction, or treatment discontinuation. Pexidartinib provides a novel non-surgical treatment option for patients with tenosynovial giant cell tumor that may significantly improve patients' overall response, range of motion, physical function, tumor volume, and stiffness.

Tenosynovial giant cell tumors (TGCTs) or giant cell tumors of tendon sheath are neoplasms that arise in the synovium. They can be categorized as nodular (localized) or diffuse type (D-TGCT). Historically, surgery has been the mainstay of therapy, but diffuse type disease recurs at a high rate and treatment often requires increasingly morbid procedures. Elucidation of the importance of the colony-stimulating factor (CSF1)/CSF1 receptor (CSF1R) pathway in the pathogenesis of this disease has created significant interest in targeting this pathway as a novel TGCT treatment approach. Pexidartinib, a selective tyrosine kinase inhibitor against CSF1R, showed an 83% disease control rate (52% with partial response and 31% with stable disease) in a recent phase 1 study of patients with TGCT. We present an illustrative example of a TGCT patient who would have required a morbid operation who derived considerable clinical benefit from pexidartinib treatment. Her tumor volume decreased by 48% after 4 months of treatment, and 55 months after starting treatment the patient exhibits continued disease stability with minimal clinical symptoms, and significant improvement in functional status. This case illustrates the effectiveness of systemic therapy in controlling a disease associated with high surgical morbidity. This approach may be especially useful in the treatment of extra-articular disease which often invades neurovascular bundles; as the effectiveness in metastatic disease is still unknown. In the future, systemic treatment for TGCT may be appropriate for the neoadjuvant setting to decrease disease burden prior to surgery with the aim of decreasing recurrence rates. However, properly designed prospective studies will need to be carried out to answer these questions.
