Autophagy induction can increase or decrease anticancer drug efficacy. Anticancer drug-induced autophagy induction is poorly characterized in osteosarcoma (OS). In this study, we investigated the impact of autophagy inhibition on camptothecin (CPT)-induced cytotoxicity in OS. Autophagy-inhibited DLM8 and K7M3 metastatic murine OS cell lines were generated by infection with lentiviral shRNA directed against the essential autophagy protein ATG5. Knockdown of ATG5 protein expression and inhibition of autophagy was confirmed by immunoblot of ATG5 and LC3II proteins, respectively. Metabolic activity was determined by MTT assay and cell viability was determined by trypan blue exclusion. Acridine orange staining and immunoblotting for LC3II protein expression were used to determine autophagy induction. Oxidative stress was assessed by staining cells with HE and DCFH-DA followed by flow cytometry analysis. Mitochondrial membrane potential was determined by staining cells with TMRE followed by flow cytometry analysis. Immunoblotting was used to detect caspase activation, Parp cleavage and p53 phosphorylation. Autophagy inhibition caused a greater deficit in metabolic activity and cell growth in K7M3 cells compared to DLM8 cells. K7M3 cells exhibited higher basal autophagy levels than DLM8 cells and non-transformed murine MCT3 osteoblasts. Autophagy inhibition did not affect CPT-induced DNA damage. Autophagy inhibition decreased CPT-induced cell death in DLM8 cells while increasing CPT-induced cell death in K7M3 cells. Autophagy inhibition reduced CPT-induced mitochondrial damage and CPT-induced caspase activation in DLM8 cells. Buthionine sulfoximine (BSO)-induced cell death was greater in autophagy-competent DLM8 cells and was reversed by antioxidant pretreatment. Camptothecin-induced and BSO-induced autophagy induction was also reversed by antioxidant pretreatment. Significantly, autophagy inhibition not only reduced CPT-induced oxidative stress but also reduced basal oxidative stress. The results of this study indicate that autophagy inhibition can have an opposing effect on CPT-induced cytotoxicity within OS. The cytoprotective mechanism of autophagy inhibition observed in DLM8 cells involves reduced CPT-induced oxidative stress and not reduced DNA damage. Our results also reveal the novel finding that knockdown of ATG5 protein reduces both basal oxidative stress and drug-induced oxidative stress.

Trigonella foenum in graecum (Fenugreek) is a traditional herbal plant used to treat disorders like diabetes, high cholesterol, wounds, inflammation, gastrointestinal ailments, and it is believed to have anti-tumor properties, although the mechanisms for the activity remain to be elucidated. In this study, we prepared a methanol extract from Fenugreek whole plants and investigated the mechanism involved in its growth-inhibitory effect on MCF- 7 human breast cancer cells. Apoptosis of MCF-7 cells was evidenced by investigating trypan blue exclusion, TUNEL and Caspase 3, 8, 9, p53, FADD, Bax and Bak by real-time PCR assays inducing activities, in the presence of FME at 65 μg/mL for 24 and 48 hours. FME induced apoptosis was mediated by the death receptor pathway as demonstrated by the increased level of Fas receptor expression after FME treatment. However, such change was found to be absent in Caspase 3, 8, 9, p53, FADD, Bax and Bak, which was confirmed by a time-dependent and dose-dependent manner. In summary, these data demonstrate that at least 90% of FME induced apoptosis in breast cell is mediated by Fas receptor-independently of either FADD, Caspase 8 or 3, as well as p53 interdependently.

In this study, responses to fatty acid treatments in commonly used prostate cancer cell culture models and variability of gene expression between them were determined. PC3, DU145, LNCaP, VCaP and PNT2 cells were treated with 100 μM of either oleate, stearate or conjugated linoleate. Cell proliferation and viability were assessed using trypan blue and 3-(4, 5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2, 5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide (MTT) assay respectively. Gene expression was measured using real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR). Conjugated linoleic acid reduced cell proliferation and viability in all prostate cancer cell lines, whilst the effects of oleic and stearic acid on proliferation were found to be cell line-dependent. A reduction in gene expression of fatty acid desaturases was observed in prostate cancer cell lines compared to normal prostate cells. Differential responses of the cell lines investigated here to fatty acid treatment suggest that multiple prostate cancer cell line models should be used when designing experiments aimed at examining lipid metabolism in prostate cancer.

Dipyrithione (PTS2) is widely used as a bactericide and fungicide. Here, we investigated whether PTS2 has broad-spectrum antitumor activity by studying its cytotoxicity and proapoptotic effects in four cancer cell lines. We used MTT assays and trypan blue staining to test the viability of cancer cell lines. Hoechst 33258 and DAPI staining were used to observe cell apoptosis. Cell-cycle percentages were analyzed by flow cytometry. Apoptosis was assayed using caspase-3 and poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) combined with Western blotting. Student's t-test was used for statistical analysis. PTS2 inhibited proliferation in four cancer cell lines in a dose-dependent manner. Treated cells showed shrinkage, irregular fragments, condensed and dispersed blue fluorescent particles compared with control cells. PTS2 induced cycle-arrest and death. Cleavage of caspase-9, caspase-3, and PARP were detected in PTS2-treated cells. Antitumor activity of PTS2 was more effective against widely used cancer drugs and its precursor. PTS2 appears to have novel cytotoxicity and potent broad-spectrum antitumor activity, which suggests its potential as the basis of an anticancer drug.

Surface coatings of nanoparticles (NPs) are known to influence advantageous features of NPs as well as potential toxicity. Iron oxide (Fe3O4) NPs are applied for both medical diagnostics and targeted drug delivery. We investigated the potential cytotoxicity and genotoxicity of uncoated iron oxide (U-Fe3O4) NPs in comparison with oleate-coated iron oxide (OC-Fe3O4) NPs. Testing was performed in vitro in human lymphoblastoid TK6 cells and in primary human blood cells. For cytotoxicity testing, relative growth activity, trypan blue exclusion, (3)H-thymidine incorporation and cytokinesis-block proliferation index were assessed. Genotoxicity was evaluated by the alkaline comet assay for detection of strand breaks and oxidized purines. Particle characterization was performed in the culture medium. Cellular uptake, morphology and pathology were evaluated by electron microscopy. U-Fe3O4 NPs were found not to be cytotoxic (considering interference of NPs with proliferation test) or genotoxic under our experimental conditions. In contrast, OC-Fe3O4 NPs were cytotoxic in a dose-dependent manner, and also induced DNA damage, indicating genotoxic potential. Intrinsic properties of sodium oleate were excluded as a cause of the toxic effect. Electron microscopy data were consistent with the cytotoxicity results. Coating clearly changed the behaviour and cellular uptake of the NPs, inducing pathological morphological changes in the cells.

Impaction allograft with cement is a common technique used in revision hip surgeries for the last 20 years. However, its clinical results are inconsistent. Recent studies have shown that mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) seeded onto allograft can enhance bone formation. This in vitro study investigates whether the increase in temperature related to the polymerisation of bone cement will affect the viability of human MSCs. The viability of human MSCs was measured after incubating them at temperatures of 38°C, 48°C and 58°C; durations 45 seconds, 80 seconds and 150 seconds. A control group was kept at 37°C and 5% carbon dioxide for the duration of the investigation (7 days). During the course of the study the human MSCs were analysed for cell metabolic activity using the alamarBlue™ assay, cell viability using both Trypan Blue dye exclusion and calcein staining under fluorescent microscopy, and necrosis and apoptosis using Annexin V and propidium iodide for flow cytometric analysis. A one-way analysis of variance with a priori Dunnett’s test was used to indicate the differences between the treatment groups, when analysed against the control. This identified conditions with a significant difference in cell metabolic activity (alamarBlue™) and cell viability (Trypan Blue). Results showed that cell metabolism was not severely affected up to 48°C/150 seconds, while cells in the 58°C group died. Similar results were shown using Trypan Blue and calcein analysis for cell viability. No significant difference in apoptosis and necrosis of the cells was observed when human MSCs treated at 48°C/150 seconds were compared with the control group. The study suggests that human MSCs seeded onto allograft can be exposed to temperatures up to 48°C for 150 seconds. Exposure to this temperature for this time period is unlikely to occur during impaction allograft surgery when cement is used. Therefore, in many situations, the addition of human MSCs to cemented impaction grafting may be carried out without detrimental effects to the cells. Furthermore, previous studies have shown that this can enhance new bone formation and repair the defects in revision situations.

The proteasome inhibitor bortezomib (PS-341) has displayed significant efficiency against pancreatic cancer cells. However, the underlying mechanisms are not fully understood. Here, we tested if ceramide production was involved in the bortezomib's effect. Two transformed pancreatic cancer cell lines (PANC-1 and Mia) and the primary pancreatic cancer cells were used. Cell death was analyzed by MTT viability assay and trypan blue staining. Cell apoptosis was analyzed by Histone DNA-ELISA assay and Annexin V FACS. Western blots were used to test signal protein changes. The cellular ceramide level after bortezomib treatment was also determined. In cultured pancreatic cancer cells, bortezomib increased cellular ceramide production to promote cell apoptosis. The ceramide de novo synthase inhibitor fumonisin B1 (F-B1) suppressed bortezomib-induced ceramide production and apoptosis, while exogenously added C6-ceramide facilitated bortezomib-induced pancreatic cancer cell death. Meanwhile, 1-phenyl-2-decanoylamino-3-morpholino-1-propanol (PDMP), the inhibitor of glucosylceramide synthetase as well as the sphingosine kinase 1 inhibitors (SKI-II and SKI-IV), facilitated bortezomib-induced ceramide production and subsequent cell apoptosis. Further, bortezomib-induced pro-apoptotic c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) activation was also associated with ceramide production. JNK activation by bortezomib was suppressed by F-B1, but was enhanced by SKI-II and PDMP in pancreatic cancer cells. Finally, C6-ceramide, SKI-II, and PDMP dramatically enhanced bortezomib-induced cytotoxicity in primary cultured pancreatic cancer cells. We found that bortezomib-induced apoptosis was associated with ceramide production in primary and transformed pancreatic cancer cells.

Ex vivo skin preservation is important for skin banks, burn centers, and in research; however, the optimal preservation solution is not known. Human amniotic fluid (HAF), in addition to its role in fetal wound healing, has promise as an effective and readily available preservation solution. The purpose of this study was to compare the efficacy of several solutions, including HAF, in full-thickness skin preservation. Human amniotic fluid was obtained from patients undergoing amniocentesis. Full-thickness skin obtained during abdominoplasty was divided into 1-cm(2) samples. These specimens were preserved in either saline, HAF from a single patient, pooled HAF, University of Wisconsin solution, or custodial histidine-tryptophan-ketoglutarate solution at 4°C. There were 5 samples in each group. Specimens were examined for keratinocyte survival at 7, 14, 21, 28, and 35 days using the trypan blue assay. The first 200 cells identified were counted to calculate the degree of cell death. Comparisons were made between the groups, and a multivariable repeated-measures analysis was performed to determine statistical significance, which was defined as P < 0.05. The individual and pooled HAF showed greater keratinocyte survival than the other solutions, at each time point. The difference was statistically significant (P < 0.05) when compared to saline and custodial solution but not statistically significant when compared to University of Wisconsin solution. When used as a tissue preservation solution, HAF produces superior keratinocyte survival than several commercially available solutions. Amniotic fluid, nature's tissue preservation solution, may be an inexpensive, readily available alternative for use in skin banks, burn centers, and research.

To immobilize dental pulp stem cells (DPSC) in alginate microspheres and to determine cell viability, proliferation, stem cell characteristics and osteogenic potential of the immobilized DPSCs. Human DPSCs isolated from the dental pulp were immobilized in 1% w/v alginate microspheres. Viability and proliferation of immobilized DPSCs were determined by trypan blue and MTT assay, respectively. Stem cell characteristics of DPSCs post immobilization were verified by labelling the cells with CD73 and CD90. Osteogenic potential of immobilized DPSCs was assessed by the presence of osteocalcin. Alizarin red staining and O-cresolphthalein complexone method confirmed and quantified calcium deposition. A final reverse transcriptase PCR evaluated the expression of osteogenic markers - ALP, Runx-2 and OCN. More than 80% of immobilized DPSCs were viable throughout the 3-week study. Proliferation appeared controlled and consistent unlike DPSCs in the control group. Presence of CD73 and CD90 markers confirmed the stem cell nature of immobilized DPSCs. The presence of osteocalcin, an osteoblastic marker, was confirmed in the microspheres on day 21. Mineralization assays showed high calcium deposition indicating elevated osteogenic potential of immobilized DPSCs. Osteogenic genes- ALP, Runx-2 and OCN were also upregulated in immobilized DPSCs. Surprisingly, immobilized DPSCs in the control group cultured in conventional stem cell media showed upregulation of osteogenic genes and expressed osteocalcin. Dental pulp stem cells immobilized in alginate hydrogels exhibit enhanced osteogenic potential while maintaining high cell viability both of which are fundamental for bone tissue regeneration.

Muscarinic acetylcholine receptor agonist pilocarpine reduces intraocular pressure (IOP) of glaucoma mainly by stimulating ciliary muscle contraction and then increasing aqueous outflow. It is of our great interest to know whether pilocarpine has the additional properties of retinal neuroprotection independent of IOP lowering in vitro and in vivo models. In rat primary retinal cultures, cell viability was measured using an MTT assay and the trypan blue exclusion method, respectively. Retinal ganglion cells (RGCs) were identified by immunofluorescence and quantified by flow cytometry. For the in vivo study, the retinal damage after retinal ischemia/reperfusion injury in rats was evaluated by histopathological study using hematoxylin and eosin staining, transmission electron microscopy, and immunohistochemical study on cleaved caspase-3, caspase-3, and ChAT. Pretreatment of pilocarpine attenuated glutamate-induced neurotoxicity of primary retinal neurons in a dose-dependent manner. Protection of pilocarpine in both retinal neurons and RGCs was largely abolished by the nonselective muscarinic receptor antagonist atropine and the M1-selective muscarinic receptor antagonist pirenzepine. After ischemia/reperfusion injury in retina, the inner retinal degeneration occurred including ganglion cell layer thinning and neuron lost, and the optic nerve underwent vacuolar changes. These degenerative changes were significantly lessened by topical application of 2% pilocarpine. In addition, the protective effect of pilocarpine on the ischemic rat retina was favorably reflected by downregulating the expression of activated apoptosis marker cleaved caspase-3 and caspase-3 and upregulating the expression of cholinergic cell marker ChAT. Taken together, this highlights pilocarpine through the activation of muscarinic receptors appear to afford significant protection against retinal neurons damage and optic nerve degeneration at clinically relevant concentrations. These data also further support muscarinic receptors as potential therapeutic neuroprotective targets in glaucoma.

Dietary habit affects the composition of human feces thus determining intestinal environment and exposure of colon mucosa to risk factors. Fecal water (FW) citotoxicity and genotoxicity were investigated in 33 healthy young Italian people, as well as the relationship between genotoxicity and nutrient intake or microflora composition. Two fecal samples were collected at 2 weeks apart and 3-d dietary diary was recorded for each volunteer. Cytotoxicity was measured using the Trypan Blue Dye Exclusion assay and genotoxicity using the Comet Assay (alkaline single-cell electrophoresis). Fecal bifidobacteria, total microbial count and nutrient intakes were also assessed. High intra- and inter-variability in genotoxicity data and in bacteria counts were found. None of the FW samples were citotoxic, but 90% of FW samples were genotoxic. Seventy five percent indicated intermediate and 15% were highly genotoxic. There was a different sex-related distribution. Genotoxicity was positively correlated to the total lipid intake in females and to the bifidobacteria/total bacteria count ratio in male volunteers. These results demonstrate that the majority of FW samples isolated from free-living Italian people show intermediate level of genotoxicity and sustain a relation between this possible non-invasive marker of colorectal cancer risk with both dietary habits and colonic ecosystem.

Uncoupling protein 2 (UCP2) is a mitochondrial membrane protein that regulates energy metabolism and reactive oxygen species (ROS) production. We generated mouse carboxy- and amino-terminal green fluorescent protein (GFP)-tagged UCP2 constructs to investigate the effect of UCP2 expression on cell proliferation and viability. UCP2-transfected Hepa 1-6 cells did not show reduced cellular adenosine triphosphate (ATP) but showed increased levels of glutathione. Flow cytometry analysis indicated that transfected cells were less proliferative than nontransfected controls, with most cells blocked at the G1 phase. The effect of UCP2 on cell cycle arrest could not be reversed by providing exogenous ATP or oxidant supply, and was not affected by the chemical uncoupler carbonyl cyanide-p-trifluoromethoxyphenylhydrazone (FCCP). However, this effect of UCP2 was augmented by treatment with genistein, a tyrosine kinase inhibitor, which by itself did not affect cell proliferation on control hepatocytes. Western blotting analysis revealed decreased expression levels of CDK6 but not CDK2 and D-type cyclins. Examination of cell viability in UCP2-transfected cells with Trypan Blue and Annexin-V staining revealed that UCP2 transfection led to significantly increased cell death. However, characteristics of apoptosis were absent in UCP2-transfected Hepa 1-6 cells, including lack of oligonucleosomal fragmentation (laddering) of chromosomal DNA, release of cytochrome c from mitochondria, and cleavage of caspase-3. In conclusion, our results indicate that UCP2 induces cell cycle arrest at G1 phase and causes nonapoptotic cell death, suggesting that UCP2 may act as a powerful influence on hepatic regeneration and cell death in the steatotic liver.

Paint thinners are organic-solvent complex mixtures frequently used by car painters around the world in industries and shops. Some studies have revealed the oxidative effect induced by thinner inhalation; however, its genotoxic effect is poorly studied. The aim of this study was to assess the cytotoxicity, genomic damage and DNA repair in vitro induced by commercial paint thinner 0.14 in human lymphocytes. Cytotoxicity was determined by cell-viability analysis with trypan blue after 4 h treatment with different thinner concentrations (0.025 to 1.2 µL/mL). Genomic damage was evaluated by means of the alkaline single-cell gel electrophoresis (SCGE; pH > 13) in treated cultures after 1 h with three low-cytotoxic thinner concentrations (0.05, 0.1 and 0.2 µL/mL). In order to evaluate the genomic DNA repair, one set of SCGE slides was prepared immediately after treatment, and another one was prepared after 4 h of liquid-holding recovery. A significant level of cytotoxicity was observed over the entire concentration range of paint thinner in lymphocytes (F = 175.98; p ≤ 0.001). In the SCGE % tail DNA assessment, a significant increase of lymphocyte genomic damage was evidenced (F = 72.32; p < 0.001). In addition, we found a significant decrease in the % tail DNA in thinner-treated cells after liquid-holding recovery period (all p < 0.05), demonstrating that DNA primary lesions induced by low-cytotoxic thinner concentrations are efficiently repaired. In conclusion, thinner components induce cytotoxicity and genomic damage in human lymphocytes under the study conditions, possibly by oxidative and alkylative DNA damage.

The development of resistance to imatinib mesylate may partly depend on high bcr-abl expression levels or point mutation(s). Arsenic trioxide (ATO) has bcr-abl suppressing activity in vitro, without cross-resistance to imatinib. Meanwhile, bcr-abl also induces expression of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), which is associated with tumor-related angiogenesis and is involved in chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML) pathogenesis. Here, we investigated ways to improve ATO activity in CML by modulating cellular VEGF levels. K562 and primary CML cells were transfected with a VEGF antisense sequence. Cell viability and survival were assessed using 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide and trypan blue exclusion assays. Apoptotic cells were detected by flow cytometry following annexin V and propidium iodide staining. The results showed that VEGF depletion effectively promotes enhanced ATO antileukemic activity by repressing bcr-abl protein levels. These data provide a rationale for the clinical development of optimized ATO-based regimens that incorporate VEGF modulator for CML treatment.

To investigate the possibility of placenta mesenchymal stem cells (PMSCs) differentiation into dermal fibroblast, and the potency of PMSCs used in cutaneous wound healing and stored as seed cells. Enzyme digestion method was used to obtain PMSCs, and PMSCs were amplified after culture in vitro. Flow cytometry assay, osteogenic and adipogenic differentiation were done for MSCs identification. The induction medium composed of DMEM/F12 + 50 microg/ml VC + 100 ng/ml connective tissue growth factor (CTGF) was added into the 24-well plate for 16 days induction period. Pictures were taken to record morphologic change. Immunofluorescence tests were performed to detect Vimentin, FSP-1, collagen I , collagen III, desmin and laminin expression before and after induction. At the same time osteogenic and adipogenic differentiation were used to assay the differentiation ability change after induction. The induced dermal fibroblasts were frozen in liquid nitrogen and recovery and trypan blue was used to detect cell viability. After CTGF induction, PMSCs got obvious fibroblasts morphology, the protein level of Vimentin, FSP-1, collagen I, collagen III and Laminin increased, PMSCs started to express Desmin, the dermal fibroblasts specific proteins, and osteogenic and adipogenic differentiation ability was diminished. PMSCs were successfully induced into dermal fibroblasts, and these induced cells could get a high cell viability ( more than 90% ) after recovery. PMSCs could be induced into dermal fibroblasts by CTGF in vitro. PMSCs have the potential application in skin wound healing, and can be used as seed cells of dermal fibroblasts.

To assess the viability of cultured epithelium and preserved by freezing for periods varying from one month to one year. Samples of cultured epithelium were incubated in cryoprotectant medium (Group A), packed in aluminum envelopes and packed in polystyrene boxes. The boxes were subjected to a temperature of-70 ºC. After freezing for a period of time ranging from one to 12 months, cultured epithelial samples were assessed for their viability by vital staining (Trypan blue) and metabolic analysis based on glucose consumption and lactate production. Samples of not frozen cultured epithelium (Group B) were also tested for viability and the results obtained were used as comparison parameter for the variation of viability. Statistical analysis between the group A and B indicate that the mean age of the donors (p=0.51) and the culture time (p=1.18) showed no statistical difference. In 30 days we obtained 37% of the original viability of cultured epithelium, 25% at six months and one year, less than 15%. This trend was confirmed statistically with a reduction of approximately 1.8% of the original viability epithelium cultured every 30 days of storage. In the analysis by lactate production, similar results were observed. In the analysis by the glucose consumption results were not significant. The viability indices show statistically significant difference between the group A and B (p<0.0001). Although cryopreserved cultured epithelium showed significant reduction of viability, all samples remained viable. It was also found that the viability of cryopreserved cultured epithelial decreased as a function of storage time.

Baicalin is one of the major compounds in the traditional Chinese medicinal herb from Scutellaria baicalensis Georgi. We investigated the molecular mechanisms of cell autophagy induced by baicalin in human bladder cancer T24 cells. Baicalin inhibited cell survival as shown by MTT assay and increased cell death by trypan blue exclusion assay in a concentration-dependent manner. Baicalin did not induce apoptotic cell death in T24 cells by TUNEL and caspase-3 activity assay. Baicalin induced the acidic vesicular organelle cell autophagy marker, manifested by acridine orange (AO) and monodansylcadaverine (MDC) staining and cleavage of microtubule-associated protein 1 light chain 3 (LC3). The protein expression levels of the Atg 5, Atg 7, Atg 12, Beclin-1 and LC3-II were upregulated in T24 cells after baicalin treatment. Inhibition of autophagy by 3-methyl-adenine (an inhibitor of class III phosphatidylinositol-3 kinase; 3-MA) reduced the cleavage of LC3 in T24 cells after baicalin treatment. Furthermore, protein expression levels of phospho-AKT (Ser473) and enzyme activity of AKT were downregulated in T24 cells after baicalin treatment. In conclusion, baicalin triggered cell autophagy through the AKT signaling pathway in T24 cells.

Contrast-induced nephropathy represents the third cause of hospital-acquired acute renal failure. This study investigated the effects of low- vs iso-osmolar contrast medium (CM) exposure on NADPH-dependent reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation by tubular cells. X-ray attenuation of iohexol, iopamidol, and iodixanol was assessed at equimolar iodine concentrations and their effects on human renal proximal tubular cells (PTCs) were evaluated with equally attenuating solutions of each CM. Cytotoxicity, apoptosis, and necrosis were investigated by trypan blue exclusion, MTT assay, and annexin V/propidium iodide assay, respectively. ROS production was assessed by DCF assay, NADPH oxidase activity by the lucigenin-enhanced chemiluminescence method, and Nox4 expression by immunoblot. Yielding the same X-ray attenuation, CM cytotoxicity was assessed in PTCs at equimolar iodine concentrations. More necrosis was present after incubation with iohexol and iopamidol than after incubation with equal concentrations of iodixanol. Iohexol and iodixanol at low iodine concentrations induced less cytotoxicity than iopamidol. Moreover, both iohexol and iopamidol induced more apoptosis than iodixanol, with a dose-dependent effect. ROS generation was significantly higher with iopamidol and iohexol compared to iodixanol. NADPH oxidase activity and Nox4 protein expression significantly increased after exposure to iopamidol and iohexol, with a dose-dependent effect, compared with iodixanol. CM-induced Nox4 expression and activity depended upon Src activation. In conclusion, at angiographic concentrations, iodixanol induces fewer cytotoxic effects on cultured tubular cells than iohexol and iopamidol along with a lower induction of Nox4-dependent ROS generation. This enzyme may, thus, represent a potential therapeutic target to prevent iodinated CM-related oxidative stress.

Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is the third leading cause of cancer deaths reported worldwide. The incidence is higher in Asia and Africa, where there is greater endemic prevalence of hepatitis B and C. The devastating outcome of cancer can be minimized only by the use of potent therapeutic agents. Tridham (TD) has been acknowledged since olden days for its wide spectrum of biological properties and was used by traditional practitioners of Siddha and other indigenous systems of medicine. The present study aims at investigating the mechanistic action of TD by assessing the antiproliferative and pro-apoptotic effects on human hepatocellular carcinoma cell line (Huh7). Cell viability and apoptosis assay using MTT analysis and trypan blue staining, DAPI staining, DNA fragmentation, cell cycle analysis, mitochondrial membrane potential, real-time reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction, western blotting and immunofluorescence staining were determined in Huh7 cells. Viability studies of TD treated Huh7 cells showed an inhibition in cell growth in time and dose dependent manner. Chromatin condensation, DNA fragmentation and apoptotic bodies, which are structural changes characteristic of apoptosis, were found following TD treatment of Huh7 cells. DAPI staining and agarose gel electrophoresis confirmed the induction of apoptosis by TD. Cell cycle analysis of Huh7 cells treated with TD exhibited a marked accumulation of cells in the sub-G1 phase of the cell cycle in a dose dependent manner. Immunofluorescent staining for Ki-67 showed a higher level of expression in untreated cells as compared to TD treated cells. We observed a significant loss in the mitochondrial membrane potential and the release of cytochrome c into the cytosol in TD treated cells. Down regulation of Bcl-2, up regulation of Bax and Bad as well as activation of caspases-3 and 9 were also observed. The p53 gene expression was found to be unaltered in TD treated cells. These results suggest that TD induces apoptosis of Huh7 cells through activation of Bax and triggered caspase cascade, independent of p53 function. This study throws light on the mechanistic action of TD in triggering apoptosis in Huh 7 cells.

Pterostilbene, a naturally occurring structural analog of resveratrol, has been reported to exert antiproliferative and proapoptotic effects in various cancer types. Recently, it has been demonstrated to induce both autophagy and apoptosis in human bladder and breast cancer cell lines. The aim of this study was to evaluate the effects of pterostilbene on HL60 human leukemia cells. Cell morphology was examined using confocal and electron microscopy. Cell viability was determined by MTT, neutral red uptake and trypan blue exclusion assays. LC3 processing was studied based on Western blotting and immunofluorescence analyses. Flow cytometry was used to study cell cycle distribution, phosphatidylserine externalization, caspase activation, disruption of mitochondrial membrane potential and intracellular production of reactive oxygen species. DNA degradation was examined by gel electrophoresis. We found that treatment of HL60 cells with pterostilbene at the IC90 concentration resulted in the G0/G1 cell cycle arrest. Pterostilbene induced conversion of cytosolic LC3-I to membrane-bound LC3-II and accumulation of large LC3-positive vacuolar structures. Pterostilbene also led to phosphatidylserine externalization, internucleosomal DNA fragmentation, caspase activation and disruption of mitochondrial membrane potential. Moreover, it did not induce oxidative stress. Our results suggest that pterostilbene induces accumulation of autophagic vacuoles followed by cell death in HL60 cells.

F1F0-ATP synthase (F1F0-ATPase) plays important roles in regulating mitochondrial function during hypoxia, but the effect of F1F0-ATPase defect on hypoxia/reoxygenation (H/RO) is unknown. The aim of this study was to investigate how mtDNA T8993G mutation (NARP)-induced inhibition of F1F0-ATPase modulates the H/RO-induced mitochondrial dysfunction. In addition, the potential for melatonin, a potent antioxidant with multiple mitochondrial protective properties, to protect NARP cells exposed to H/RO was assessed. NARP cybrids harboring 98% of mtDNA T8993G genes were established as an in vitro model for cells with F1F0-ATPase defect; their parental osteosarcoma 143B cells were studied for comparison. Treating the cells with H/RO using a hypoxic chamber resembles ischemia/reperfusion in vivo. NARP significantly enhanced apoptotic death upon H/RO detected by MTT assay and the trypan blue exclusion test of cell viability. Based on fluorescence probe-coupled laser scanning imaging microscopy, NARP significantly enhanced mitochondrial reactive oxygen species (mROS) formation and mitochondrial Ca(2+) (mCa(2+)) accumulation in response to H/RO, which augmented the depletion of cardiolipin, resulting in the retardation of mitochondrial movement. With stronger H/RO stress (either with longer reoxygenation duration, longer hypoxia duration, or administrating secondary oxidative stress following H/RO), NARP augmented H/RO-induced mROS formation to significantly depolarize mitochondrial membrane potential (ΔΨm), and enhance mCa(2+) accumulation and nitric oxide formation. Also, NARP augmented H/RO-induced mROS oxidized and depleted cardiolipin, thereby promoting permanent mitochondrial permeability transition, retarded mitochondrial movement, and enhanced apoptosis. Melatonin markedly reduced NARP-augmented H/RO-induced mROS formation and therefore significantly reduced mROS-mediated depolarization of ΔΨm and accumulation of mCa(2+), stabilized cardiolipin, and then improved mitochondrial movement and cell survival. NARP-induced inhibition of F1F0-ATPase enhances mROS formation upon H/RO, which augments the depletion of cardiolipin and retardation of mitochondrial movement. Melatonin may have the potential to rescue patients with ischemia/reperfusion insults, even those associated with NARP symptoms.

Janus kinase (JAK) is one of the main upstream activators of signal transducers and activators of transcription (STAT) that are constitutively activated in various malignancies and are associated with cell growth, survival, and carcinogenesis. Here, we investigated the role of JAKs in colorectal cancer in order to develop effective therapeutic targets for INCB018424, which is the first JAK1/2 inhibitor to be approved by FDA. After examining the basal expression levels of phospho-JAK1 and phospho-JAK2, we measured the effects of INCB018424 on the phosphorylation of JAK1/2 using western blot analysis. Cell viability was determined using the trypan blue exclusion assay. The cell death mechanism was identified by the activation of caspase 3 using western blot and annexin V staining. The basal levels of phospho-JAK1 and phospho-JAK2 were cancer cell type dependent. Colorectal cancer cell lines that phosphorylate both JAK1 and JAK2 include DLD-1 and RKO. INCB018424 inactivates both JAK1 and JAK2 in DLD-1 cells but inactivates only JAK1 in RKO cells. Cell death was proportional to the inactivation of JAK1 but not JAK2. INCB018424 causes caspase-dependent cell death, which is prevented by treatment with z-VAD. The inhibition of JAK1 phosphorylation seemed sufficient to allow INCB018424-mediated apoptosis. JAK1 is a key molecule that is involved in colon cancer cell survival and the inhibition of JAK1 by INCB01424 results in caspase-dependent apoptosis in colorectal cancer cells. The use of selective JAK1 inhibitors could be an attractive therapy against colorectal cancer, but further clinical investigations are needed to test this possibility.

The main objective of the present study was to investigate chemical composition and possible cyto/genotoxic potential of several medical implant materials commonly used in total hip joint replacement. Medical implant metal alloy (Ti6Al4V and CoCrMo) and high density polyethylene particles were analyzed by energy dispersive X-ray spectrometry while toxicological characterization was done on human lymphocytes using multi-biomarker approach. Energy dispersive X-ray spectrometry showed that none of the elements identified deviate from the chemical composition defined by appropriate ISO standard. Toxicological characterization showed that the tested materials were non-cyto/genotoxic as determined by the comet and cytokinesis-block micronucleus (CBMN) assay. Particle morphology was found (by using scanning electron and optical microscope) as flat, sharp-edged, irregularly shaped fiber-like grains with the mean particle size less than 10µm; this corresponds to the so-called "submicron wear". The very large surface area per wear volume enables high reactivity with surrounding media and cellular elements. Although orthopedic implants proved to be non-cyto/genotoxic, in tested concentration (10μg/ml) there is a constant need for monitoring of patients that have implanted artificial hips or other joints, to minimize the risks of any unwanted health effects. The fractal and multifractal analyses, performed in order to evaluate the degree of particle shape effect, showed that the fractal and multifractal terms are related to the "remnant" level of the particles' toxicity especially with the cell viability (trypan blue method) and total number of nucleoplasmic bridges and nuclear buds as CBMN assay parameters.

Ischemic stroke affects ∼795,000 people each year in the U.S., which results in an estimated annual cost of $73.7 billion. Calcium is pivotal in a variety of neuronal signaling cascades, however, during ischemia, excess calcium influx can trigger excitotoxic cell death. Calcium binding proteins help neurons regulate/buffer intracellular calcium levels during ischemia. Aequorin is a calcium binding protein isolated from the jellyfish Aequorea victoria, and has been used for years as a calcium indicator, but little is known about its neuroprotective properties. The present study used an in vitro rat brain slice preparation to test the hypothesis that an intra-hippocampal infusion of apoaequorin (the calcium binding component of aequorin) protects neurons from ischemic cell death. Bilaterally cannulated rats received an apoaequorin infusion in one hemisphere and vehicle control in the other. Hippocampal slices were then prepared and subjected to 5 minutes of oxygen-glucose deprivation (OGD), and cell death was assayed by trypan blue exclusion. Apoaequorin dose-dependently protected neurons from OGD--doses of 1% and 4% (but not 0.4%) significantly decreased the number of trypan blue-labeled neurons. This effect was also time dependent, lasting up to 48 hours. This time dependent effect was paralleled by changes in cytokine and chemokine expression, indicating that apoaequorin may protect neurons via a neuroimmunomodulatory mechanism. These data support the hypothesis that pretreatment with apoaequorin protects neurons against ischemic cell death, and may be an effective neurotherapeutic.
