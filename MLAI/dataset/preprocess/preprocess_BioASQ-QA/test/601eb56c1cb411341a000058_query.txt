On what chromosome would the MKKS gene for McKusick-Kaufman(AKA Kaufman-McKusick) syndrome be found?

Bardet-Biedl syndrome (BBS) is an autosomal recessive disorder with locus heterogeneity. None of the 'responsible' genes have previously been identified. Some BBS cases (approximately 10%) remain unassigned to the five previously mapped loci. McKusick-Kaufma syndrome (MKS) includes hydrometrocolpos, postaxial polydactyly and congenital heart disease, and is also inherited in an autosomal recessive manner. We ascertained 34 unrelated probands with classic features of BBS including retinitis pigmentosa (RP), obesity and polydactyly. The probands were from families unsuitable for linkage because of family size. We found MKKS mutations in four typical BBS probands (Table 1). The first is a 13-year-old Hispanic girl with severe RP, PAP, mental retardation and obesity (BMI >40). She was a compound heterozygote for a missense (1042GA, G52D) and a nonsense (1679TA, Y264stop) mutation in exon 3. Cloning and sequencing of the separate alleles confirmed that the mutations were present in trans. A second BBS proband (from Newfoundland), born to consanguineous parents, was homozygous for two deletions (1316delC and 1324-1326delGTA) in exon 3, predicting a frameshift. An affected brother was also homozygous for the deletions, whereas an unaffected sibling had two normal copies of MKKS. Both the proband and her affected brother had RP, PAP, mild mental retardation, morbid obesity (BMI >50 and 37, respectively), lobulated kidneys with prominent calyces and diabetes mellitus (diagnosed at ages 33 and 30, respectively). A deceased sister (DNA unavailable) had similar phenotypic features (RP with blindness by age 13, BMI >45, abnormal glucose tolerance test and IQ=64, vaginal atresia and syndactyly of both feet). Both parents and the maternal grandfather were heterozygous for the deletions. Genotyping with markers from the MKKS region confirmed homozygosity at 20p12 in both affected individuals.

McKusick-Kaufman syndrome (MKS, OMIM #236700) is a rare syndrome inherited in an autosomal recessive pattern with a phenotypic triad comprising hydrometrocolpos (HMC), postaxial polydactyly (PAP), and congenital cardiac disease (CHD). The syndrome is caused by mutations in the MKKS gene mapped onto chromosome 20p12 between D20S162 and D20S894 markers. Mutations in the same gene causes Bardet-Biedl-6 syndrome (BBS-6, OMIM #209900) inherited in an autosomal recessive pattern. BBS-6 comprises retinitis pigmentosa, polydactyly, obesity, mental retardation, renal and genital anomalies. HMC, CHD, and PAP defects can also occur in BBS-6, and there is a significant clinical overlap between MKS and BBS-6 in childhood. We describe a new borderline case of MKS and BBS syndrome and suggest insights for understanding correlation between MKKS gene mutations and clinical phenotype. Here, we report the results of molecular analysis of MKKS in a female proband born in an Italian nonconsanguineous healthy family that presents HMC and PAP. The mutational screening revealed the presence of two different heterozygous missense variants (p.242A>S in exon 3, p.339 I>V in exon 4) in the MKKS gene, and a nucleotide variation in 5'UTR region in exon 2 (-417 A>C).

We report a 19-year-old, non-Amish Caucasian female patient with primary amenorrhea caused by complete lack of Müllerian fusion with vaginal agenesis or Müllerian aplasia (MA), postaxial polydactyly (PAP), and tetralogy of Fallot. The genital tract anomaly of MA with and without renal or skeletal anomalies comprises Mayer-Rokitansky-Kuster-Hauser syndrome, which has not been reported with tetralogy of Fallot. The phenotypic triad of anomalies most closely resembled McKusick-Kaufman syndrome (MKS; OMIM 236700), a rare multiple congenital anomaly syndrome comprised of hydrometrocolpos (HMC), PAP, and congenital heart malformation that is inherited in an autosomal recessive pattern. While upper reproductive tract anomalies have not been reported with MKS, they have been reported with Bardet-Biedl syndrome (BBS), a syndrome that significantly overlaps with MKS. Both MKS and BBS can be caused by mutations in the MKKS or BBS6 gene on chromosome 20p12 and BBS is also associated with mutations in other genes (BBS1, BBS2, BBS4, and BBS7). To address this heterogenity, we sequenced the causative genes in MKS and BBS but no mutations in these five genes were identified. Fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) excluded large deletions of chromosome 20p12 and microsatellite marker studies confirmed biparental inheritance for all of the known BBS loci. The dual midline fusion defects of tetralogy of Fallot and MA suggests that either this patient has a unique syndrome with a distinct genetic etiology or that she has a genetically heterogeneous or variant form of MKS.

McKusick-Kaufman syndrome (MKKS, MIM 236700) is a human developmental anomaly syndrome comprising hydrometrocolpos (HMC), postaxial polydactyly (PAP) and congenital heart disease (CHD). MKKS has been mapped in the Old Order Amish population to 20p12, between D20S162 and D20S894 (ref. 3). Here we describe the identification of a gene mutated in MKKS. We analysed the approximately 450-kb candidate region by sample sequencing, which revealed the presence of several known genes and EST clusters. We evaluated candidate transcripts by northern-blot analysis of adult and fetal tissues. We selected one transcript with widespread expression, MKKS, for analysis in a patient from the Amish pedigree and a sporadic, non-Amish case. The Old Order Amish patient was found to be homozygous for an allele that had two missense substitutions and the non-Amish patient was a compound heterozygote for a frameshift mutation predicting premature protein truncation and a distinct missense mutation. The MKKS predicted protein shows amino acid similarity to the chaperonin family of proteins, suggesting a role for protein processing in limb, cardiac and reproductive system development. We believe that this is the first description of a human disorder caused by mutations affecting a putative chaperonin molecule.
