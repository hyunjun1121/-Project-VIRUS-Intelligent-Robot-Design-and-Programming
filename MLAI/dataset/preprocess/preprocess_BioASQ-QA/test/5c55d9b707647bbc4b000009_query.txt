This manuscript reviews the studies performed with ALX-0081 (INN: caplacizumab), a Nanobody targeting von Willebrand factor, in the context of current antithrombotic therapy in coronary artery disease. ALX-0081 specifically inhibits platelet adhesion to the vessel wall, and may control platelet aggregation and subsequent clot formation without increasing bleeding risk. A substantial number of antithrombotics are aimed at this cascade; however, their generally indiscriminative mode of action can result in a narrow therapeutic window, defined by the risk for bleeding complications, and thrombotic events. Nonclinically, ALX-0081 compared favorably to several antithrombotics. In Phase I studies in healthy subjects and stable angina patients undergoing percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI), ALX-0081 was well tolerated, and effectively inhibited pharmacodynamic markers. Following these results, a phase II study was initiated in high-risk acute coronary syndrome patients undergoing PCI. Based on its mechanism of action, ALX-0081 is also being developed for acquired thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura.

Tremendous effort has been expended over the past two and a half decades to understand many aspects of camelid heavy chain antibodies, from their biology, evolution, and immunogenetics to their potential applications in various fields of research and medicine. In this article, I present a historical perspective on the development of camelid single-domain antibodies (sdAbs or V<sub>H</sub>Hs, also widely known as nanobodies) since their discovery and discuss the advantages and disadvantages of these unique molecules in various areas of research, industry, and medicine. Commercialization of camelid sdAbs exploded in 2001 with a flurry of patents issued to the Vrije Universiteit Brussel (VUB) and later taken on by the Vlaams Interuniversitair Instituut voor Biotechnologie (VIB) and, after 2002, the VIB-founded spin-off company, Ablynx. While entrepreneurial spirit has certainly catalyzed the exploration of nanobodies as marketable products, IP restrictions may be partially responsible for the relatively long time span between the discovery of these biomolecules and their entry into the pharmaceutical market. It is now anticipated that the first V<sub>H</sub>H-based antibody drug, Caplacizumab, a bivalent anti-vWF antibody for treating rare blood clotting disorders, may be approved and commercialized in 2018 or shortly thereafter. This elusive first approval, along with the expiry of key patents, may substantially alter the scientific and biomedical landscape surrounding camelid sdAbs and pave the way for their emergence as mainstream biotherapeutics.

Thrombotic microangiopathies are almost devastating diseases leading to death at high frequency if untreated. They consist of at least five distinct entities, TTP, HUS, aHUS, TMA due to drug interference, systemic disease or post therapy TMA. Around 10 years ago there was only one established therapeutic approach as plasmapheresis. Meanwhile, there are new drugs been licensed or within licensing process. Patients with atypical HUS can be treated successfully by the Complement inhibitor Eculizumab. In addition, there is a new inhibitor of von-Willebrand-Polymerisation available. Caplacizumab provides a significantly better remission and decrease in TMA-related death. For therapy associated TMA as VOD/SOS Defibrotide could be established within a phase III study to significantly improve outcomes. In order to select these new medical approaches individual diagnostic parameters need to be established in order to rapidly distinguish between the TMA entities and start targeted therapy.

The thrombotic-thrombocytopenic purpura (TTP) is an acute, life-threatening disease, characterised by enhanced platelet aggregation, disturbed microcirculation and organ dysfunction. With the currently available treatment (plasma exchange, infusions, corticosteroids) mortality ist still as high as 10-15 %. Recent, pathophysiology-based developments may improve the outcome. The most promising candidates for future treatment of TTP are: rituximab for termination of the autoimmune process, caplacizumab for prevention of platelet-VWF-interaction, and recombinant ADAMTS13 for replacement of the inhibited or missing enzyme.

Essentials Acquired thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura (aTTP) is linked with significant morbidity/mortality. Caplacizumab's effect on major thromboembolic (TE) events, exacerbations and death was studied. Fewer caplacizumab-treated patients had a major TE event, an exacerbation, or died versus placebo. Caplacizumab has the potential to reduce the acute morbidity and mortality associated with aTTP. Background Acquired thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura (aTTP) is a life-threatening autoimmune thrombotic microangiopathy. In spite of treatment with plasma exchange and immunosuppression, patients remain at risk for thrombotic complications, exacerbations, and death. In the phase II TITAN study, treatment with caplacizumab, an anti-von Willebrand factor Nanobody<sup>®</sup> was shown to reduce the time to confirmed platelet count normalization and exacerbations during treatment. Objective The clinical benefit of caplacizumab was further investigated in a post hoc analysis of the incidence of major thromboembolic events and exacerbations during the study drug treatment period and thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura-related death during the study. Methods The Standardized Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities (MedDRA) Query (SMQ) for 'embolic and thrombotic events' was run to investigate the occurrence of major thromboembolic events and exacerbations in the safety population of the TITAN study, which consisted of 72 patients, of whom 35 received caplacizumab and 37 received placebo. Results Four events (one pulmonary embolism and three aTTP exacerbations) were reported in four patients in the caplacizumab group, and 20 such events were reported in 14 patients in the placebo group (two acute myocardial infarctions, one ischemic stroke, one hemorrhagic stroke, one pulmonary embolism, one deep vein thrombosis, one venous thrombosis, and 13 aTTP exacerbations). Two of the placebo-treated patients died from aTTP during the study. Conclusion In total, 11.4% of caplacizumab-treated patients and 43.2% of placebo-treated patients experienced one or more major thromboembolic events, experienced an exacerbation, or died. This analysis shows the potential for caplacizumab to reduce the risk of major thromboembolic morbidities and mortality associated with aTTP.

Ablynx, a Sanofi Company, has developed the anti-von Willebrand factor Nanobody<sup>®</sup> caplacizumab (Cablivi™) for the treatment of acquired thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura (aTTP). Based on positive results in phase II and III trials in patients with aTTP, caplacizumab was recently approved in the EU for the treatment of adults experiencing an episode of aTTP, in conjunction with plasma exchange and immunosuppression. This article summarizes the milestones in the development of caplacizumab leading to this first approval.

Daily therapeutic plasma exchange (TPE) transformed the historically fatal prognosis of acquired, anti-ADAMTS13 antibody-mediated thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura (TTP), leading to the current overall survival rates of >80%. However, relapses occur in up to 40% of patients and refractory disease with fatal outcomes still occurs, typically within the first days of management. In this context, the introduction of rituximab has been the second major breakthrough in TTP management. Rituximab is now routinely recommended during the acute phase, typically in patients with a suboptimal response to treatment, and increasingly as frontline therapy, with high response rates in the following weeks. In more severe patients, salvage strategies typically include twice daily TPE, pulses of cyclophosphamide, as well as splenectomy in the more desperate cases. In this life-threatening and debilitating disease, relapses can be efficiently prevented in patients with a severe acquired ADAMTS13 deficiency and otherwise in remission with the use of rituximab. In the coming years, the TTP therapeutic landscape should be enriched by original strategies stemming from clinical experience and new agents that are currently being evaluated in large, international, clinical trials. Promising agents under evaluation include caplacizumab (an inhibitor of the glycoprotein-Ib/IX-Von-Willebrand factor axis), N-acetylcysteine, recombinant ADAMTS13, and anti-plasmocyte compounds.

However, relapses occur in up to 40% of patients and refractory disease with fatal outcomes still occurs. In this context, the introduction of rituximab has probably been the second major breakthrough in TTP management. Rituximab is now routinely recommended during the acute phase, typically in patients with a suboptimal response to treatment, or even as frontline therapy, with high response rates. In more severe patients, salvage strategies may include twice daily TPE, pulses of cyclophosphamide, vincristine, as well as splenectomy in the more desperate cases. In this life-threatening disease, relapses can be efficiently prevented in patients with a severe acquired ADAMTS13 deficiency and otherwise in remission with the use of rituximab. In the coming years, the TTP therapeutic landscape should be enriched by original strategies stemming from clinical experience and new agents that are currently being evaluated in large, ideally international, clinical trials. Promising agents under evaluation include N-acetylcysteine, bortezomib, recombinant ADAMTS13 and caplacizumab, an inhibitor of the glycoprotein-Ib/IX-von Willebrand factor axis.

Thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura (TTP) is characterized by microangiopathic hemolytic anemia and a consumptive thrombocytopenia, as a result of severe deficiency of ADAMTS13. The standard of care of the acute episode is treatment with plasma exchange and immunosuppression. After the acute episode is resolved, patients face a significant risk of relapse and long-term complications associated with significant morbidity and even mortality. Novel treatments have been under development and will be discussed in this review. Caplacizumab, a nanobody that blocks the interaction between VWF and platelets, has shown promising results in decreasing the time to recover from the acute events that will hopefully translate into long-term clinical benefit for patients. In addition, identifying biomarkers to allow us to better predict the risk for relapse and the development of these long-term complications in patients with TTP are a few of the challenges that require our attention moving forward.

Acquired thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura (TTP) is caused by aggregation of platelets on ultralarge von Willebrand factor multimers. This microvascular thrombosis causes multiorgan ischemia with potentially life-threatening complications. Daily plasma exchange and immunosuppressive therapies induce remission, but mortality and morbidity due to microthrombosis remain high. Caplacizumab, an anti-von Willebrand factor humanized single-variable-domain immunoglobulin (Nanobody), inhibits the interaction between ultralarge von Willebrand factor multimers and platelets. In this phase 2, controlled study, we randomly assigned patients with acquired TTP to subcutaneous caplacizumab (10 mg daily) or placebo during plasma exchange and for 30 days afterward. The primary end point was the time to a response, defined as confirmed normalization of the platelet count. Major secondary end points included exacerbations and relapses. Seventy-five patients underwent randomization (36 were assigned to receive caplacizumab, and 39 to receive placebo). The time to a response was significantly reduced with caplacizumab as compared with placebo (39% reduction in median time, P=0.005). Three patients in the caplacizumab group had an exacerbation, as compared with 11 patients in the placebo group. Eight patients in the caplacizumab group had a relapse in the first month after stopping the study drug, of whom 7 had ADAMTS13 activity that remained below 10%, suggesting unresolved autoimmune activity. Bleeding-related adverse events, most of which were mild to moderate in severity, were more common with caplacizumab than with placebo (54% of patients vs. 38%). The frequencies of other adverse events were similar in the two groups. Two patients in the placebo group died, as compared with none in the caplacizumab group. Caplacizumab induced a faster resolution of the acute TTP episode than did placebo. The platelet-protective effect of caplacizumab was maintained during the treatment period. Caplacizumab was associated with an increased tendency toward bleeding, as compared with placebo. (Funded by Ablynx; ClinicalTrials.gov number, NCT01151423.).
