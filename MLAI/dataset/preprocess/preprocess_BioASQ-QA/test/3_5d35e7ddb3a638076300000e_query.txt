In which cell organelle is the SAF-A protein localized?

[PMID: 10933876]
One class of heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoproteins (hnRNPs), AUF1/hnRNP D, consists of four isoform proteins (p45, p42, p40, and p37) which are generated by alternative splicing. The present study was therefore undertaken to clarify any isoform-specific differences in terms of their functions and nucleocytoplasmic localization. All isoforms primarily localized in the nucleus. However, heterokaryon analysis and a study using RNA polymerase II inhibitor revealed that p40/p37 exhibited a continuous shuttling between the nucleus and cytoplasm. Constant nuclear retention activity was mapped to the p45/p42-specific sequence at the C-terminal region, which is retained by alternative splicing. Using this domain as a probe, we performed a yeast two-hybrid screening and we found that scaffold attachment factor B (SAF-B), a nuclear matrix-associated protein, exhibits protein-protein interaction to this region. Colocalization of p45/p42 and SAF-B was observed as a speckle in the nucleus. Interestingly, p45/p42 isoforms appeared to act as a negative regulator in gene expression by forming a complex with SAF-B. Thus, the present study revealed that the isoform-specific functions of AUF1/hnRNP D are defined by intracellular shuttling capacity.

SAF-A/hnRNP U is an abundant nuclear protein that interacts specifically with nuclear matrix attachment region DNA (MAR) and RNA as a component of hnRNPs. SAF-A/hnRNP U was also shown to specifically bind mouse major satellite DNA (satMa). Antibodies against SAF-A and GFP-fusion constructs were used in the current work in order to trace SAF-A localization. In accordance with its diverse nucleic acid binding specificity, SAF-A was found to be localized in three different domains: outside the chromosomes, on the surface of the chromosome arms (probably MARs), and in the centromere region where it apparently binds specifically to the satMa. GFP-fusion constructs with different SAF-A/hnRNP U domains confirms the functional significance of the protein's functional domains in interphase cells. In telophase cells, the anti-SAF-A antibody signal appeared as a kind of network covering unfolded chromosomes.

Scaffold attachment factor A (SAF-A) participates in the regulation of gene expression by organizing chromatin into transcriptionally active domains and by interacting directly with RNA polymerase II. Here we use co-localization, co-immunoprecipitation (co-IP) and in situ proximity ligation assay (PLA) to identify Brahma Related Gene 1 (BRG1), the ATP-driven motor of the human SWI-SNF chromatin remodeling complex, as another SAF-A interaction partner in mouse embryonic stem (mES) cells. We also employ RNA interference to investigate functional aspects of the SAF-A/BRG1 interaction. We find that endogenous SAF-A protein interacts with endogenous BRG1 protein in mES cells, and that the interaction does not solely depend on the presence of mRNA. Moreover the interaction remains intact when cells are induced to differentiate. Functional analyses reveal that dual depletion of SAF-A and BRG1 abolishes global transcription by RNA polymerase II, while the nucleolar RNA polymerase I transcription machinery remains unaffected. We demonstrate that SAF-A interacts with BRG1 and that both components are required for RNA Polymerase II Mediated Transcription.
