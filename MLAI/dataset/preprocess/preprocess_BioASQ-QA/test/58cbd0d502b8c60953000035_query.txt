Which mutated gene causes the Chédiak–Higashi Syndrome?

[PMID: 14599068]
Chediak-Higashi syndrome (CHS) is a rare multiorgan disease entity with autosomal recessive inheritance characterized by oculocutaneous albinism, bleeding tendency, recurrent bacterial infections and various neurological symptoms. Intracellular vesicle formation is deficient, resulting in giant granules in many cells, e.g. giant melanosomes in the melanocytes. Diagnosis has been based on morphological examination of peripheral blood and bone marrow, with giant granules seen in cells of the myeloid lineage and in lymphocytes. The ultimate diagnostic test is to look for a mutated LYST gene. Most patients develop an accelerated phase of the disease with deposition of lymphohistiocytes in the liver, spleen, lymph nodes and bone marrow, resulting in hepatosplenomegaly, bone marrow infiltration and haemophagocytosis. Peripheral blood neutropenia becomes more profound as anaemia and thrombocytopenia develop. Most patients succumb before the age of 10 years. Four patients with CHS are described, one of whom is a long-term survivor after successful allogeneic bone marrow transplantation, two succumbed during the accelerated phase and one is living with a chronic form of the disease. Allogeneic bone marrow transplantation from an HLA-matched sibling is the therapy of choice and should be performed early. If there is no matched family donor, an unrelated donor or a placental blood graft is a good alternative. The clinical picture of CHS is heterogeneous and therapeutic decisions need to be made on an individual basis.

LYST is a large cytosolic protein that influences the biogenesis of lysosome-related organelles, and mutation of the encoding gene, LYST, can cause Chediak-Higashi syndrome. Recently, Lyst-mutant mice were recognized to also exhibit an iris disease resembling exfoliation syndrome, a common cause of glaucoma in humans. Here, Lyst-mutant iris phenotypes were used in a search for genes that influence Lyst pathways. In a candidate gene-driven approach, albino Lyst-mutant mice homozygous for a mutation in Tyr, whose product is key to melanin synthesis within melanosomes, exhibited complete rescue of Lyst-mutant iris phenotypes. In a genetic background-driven approach using a DBA/2J strain of congenic mice, an interval containing Tyrp1 enhanced Lyst-dependent iris phenotypes. Thus, both experimental approaches implicated the melanosome, an organelle that is a potential source of oxidative stress, as contributing to the disease phenotype. Confirming an association with oxidative damage, Lyst mutation resulted in genetic context-sensitive changes in iris lipid hydroperoxide levels, being lowest in albino and highest in DBA/2J mice. Surprisingly, the DBA/2J genetic background also exposed a late-onset neurodegenerative phenotype involving cerebellar Purkinje-cell degeneration. These results identify an association between oxidative damage to lipid membranes and the severity of Lyst-mutant phenotypes, revealing a new mechanism that contributes to pathophysiology involving LYST.

Peripheral neuropathy (PN) has been reported in idiopathic and hereditary forms of parkinsonism, but the pathogenic mechanisms are unclear and likely heterogeneous. Levodopa-induced vitamin B12 deficiency has been discussed as a causal factor of PN in idiopathic Parkinson's disease, but peripheral nervous system involvement might also be a consequence of the underlying neurodegenerative process. Occurrence of PN with parkinsonism has been associated with a panel of mitochondrial cytopathies, more frequently related to a nuclear gene defect and mainly polymerase gamma (POLG1) gene. Parkin (PARK2) gene mutations are responsible for juvenile parkinsonism, and possible peripheral nervous system involvement has been reported. Rarely, an association of parkinsonism with PN may be encountered in other neurodegenerative diseases such as fragile X-associated tremor and ataxia syndrome related to premutation CGG repeat expansion in the fragile X mental retardation (FMR1) gene, Machado-Joseph disease related to an abnormal CAG repeat expansion in ataxin-3 (ATXN3) gene, Kufor-Rakeb syndrome caused by mutations in ATP13A2 gene, or in hereditary systemic disorders such as Gaucher disease due to mutations in the β-glucocerebrosidase (GBA) gene and Chediak-Higashi syndrome due to LYST gene mutations. This article reviews conditions in which PN may coexist with parkinsonism.

Autosomal-recessive hereditary spastic paraplegias (AR-HSP) consist of a genetically diverse group of neurodegenerative diseases characterised by pyramidal tracts dysfunction. The causative genes for many types of AR-HSP remain elusive. We tried to identify the gene mutation for AR-HSP with cerebellar ataxia and neuropathy. This study included two patients in a Japanese family with their parents who are first cousins. Neurological examination and gene analysis were conducted in the two patients and two normal family members. We undertook genome-wide linkage analysis employing single nucleotide polymorphism arrays using the two patients' DNAs and exome sequencing using one patient's sample. We detected a homozygous missense mutation (c.4189T>G, p.F1397V) in the lysosomal trafficking regulator (LYST) gene, which is described as the causative gene for Chédiak-Higashi syndrome (CHS). CHS is a rare autosomal-recessive syndrome characterised by hypopigmentation, severe immune deficiency, a bleeding tendency and progressive neurological dysfunction. This mutation was co-segregated with the disease in the family and was located at well-conserved amino acid. This LYST mutation was not found in 200 Japanese control DNAs. Microscopic observation of peripheral blood in the two patients disclosed large peroxidase-positive granules in both patients' granulocytes, although they had no symptoms of immune deficiency or bleeding tendency. We diagnosed these patients as having adult CHS presenting spastic paraplegia with cerebellar ataxia and neuropathy. The clinical spectrum of CHS is broader than previously recognised. Adult CHS must be considered in the differential diagnosis of AR-HSP.

Chediak-Higashi syndrome (CHS) is caused by mutations in the gene encoding LYST protein, the function of which remains poorly understood. Prominent features of CHS include defective secretory lysosome exocytosis and the presence of enlarged, lysosome-like organelles in several cell types. In order to get further insight into the role of LYST in the biogenesis and exocytosis of cytotoxic granules, we analyzed cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTLs) from patients with CHS. Using confocal microscopy and correlative light electron microscopy, we showed that the enlarged organelle in CTLs is a hybrid compartment that contains proteins components from recycling-late endosomes and lysosomes. Enlargement of cytotoxic granules results from the progressive clustering and then fusion of normal-sized endolysosomal organelles. At the immunological synapse (IS) in CHS CTLs, cytotoxic granules have limited motility and appear docked while nevertheless unable to degranulate. By increasing the expression of effectors of lytic granule exocytosis, such as Munc13-4, Rab27a and Slp3, in CHS CTLs, we were able to restore the dynamics and the secretory ability of cytotoxic granules at the IS. Our results indicate that LYST is involved in the trafficking of the effectors involved in exocytosis required for the terminal maturation of perforin-containing vesicles into secretory cytotoxic granules.

Mutations in LYST, a gene encoding a putative lysosomal trafficking protein, cause Chédiak-Higashi syndrome (CHS), an autosomal recessive disorder typically characterized by infantile-onset hemophagocytic syndrome and immunodeficiency, and oculocutaneous albinism. A small number of reports of rare, attenuated forms of CHS exist, with affected individuals exhibiting progressive neurodegenerative disease beginning in early adulthood with cognitive decline, parkinsonism, features of spinocerebellar degeneration, and peripheral neuropathy, as well as subtle pigmentary abnormalities and subclinical or absent immune dysfunction. In a consanguineous Pakistani kindred with clinical phenotypes consistent with attenuated CHS, we performed SNP array-based homozygosity mapping and whole gene sequencing of LYST. We identified three individuals homozygous for a novel six base pair in-frame deletion in LYST (c.9827_9832ATACAA), predicting the loss of asparagine and threonine residues from the LYST transcript (p.Asn3276_Thr3277del), and segregating with the phenotype in this family. We further characterize the neurologic features of the attenuated form of CHS, and discuss pathophysiologic mechanisms underlying the neurodegenerative components of CHS. Attenuated CHS is phenotypically heterogenous and should be considered when young adults develop neurodegenerative disease and have pigmentary abnormalities. We briefly discuss surveillance and management of patients with CHS-related neurodegeneration.

One of the colors of mink is Aleutian (aa)-a specific gun-metal gray pigmentation of the fur-commonly used in combination with other color loci to generate popular colors such as Violet (aammpp) and Sapphire (aapp). The Aleutian color allele is a manifestation of mink Chédiak-Higashi syndrome (CHS), which has been described in humans and several other species. As with forms of CHS in other species, we report that the mink CHS is linked to the lysosomal trafficking regulator ( LYST ) gene. Furthermore, we have identified a base deletion (c.9468delC) in exon 40 of LYST, which causes a frameshift and virtually terminates the LYST product prematurely (p.Leu3156Phefs*37). We investigated the blood parameters of three wild-type mink and three CHS mink. No difference in the platelet number between the two groups was observed, but an accumulation of platelets between the groups appears different when collagen is used as a coagulant. Microscopic analysis of peripheral blood indicates giant inclusions in the neutrophils of the Aleutian mink types. Molecular findings at the LYST locus enable the development of genetic tests for analyzing the color selection in American mink.

Genetic alteration of the adaptor protein (AP)-3 complex is responsible for the type 2 Hermansky-Pudlak syndrome, a lysosomal storage disease similar to the Chediak-Higashi syndrome (CHS). AP-3 presumably participates in the biogenesis of late endosomal compartments and may also be critical for the regulated secretion of lysosomes by specialized cells. Here, Dictyostelium discoideum cells defective for the mu3 subunit of the AP-3 complex were used and their phenotype analyzed. In mu3 mutant cells, endosomal maturation and lysosome secretion were markedly slower than that in wild-type cells. This phenotype is similar to that reported previously in lvsB mutant cells where the ortholog of the LYST gene, involved in CHS, is mutated. Detailed analysis revealed however significant differences between these two isogenic mutant cells: in lvsB mutant cells, the primary defect is an inefficient biogenesis of otherwise normal secretory lysosomes, while in mu3 mutant cells, the biogenesis and also the composition and the fusion properties of secretory lysosomes are affected. These results suggest that in D. discoideum, AP-3 controls both the efficiency and the specificity of postlysosome maturation, which represent two critical elements in the control of lysosome secretion.

Chediak-Higashi syndrome (CHS) is an autosomal recessive hereditary disorder in Japanese Black cattle, caused by a mutation of the Lyst gene. So far, the mutation has been detected by PCR-restriction fragment length polymorphism (PCR-RFLP) analysis. However, this method is disadvantaged by its low-throughput performance. Here, we report an alternative method involving real-time PCR with TaqMan minor groove binder probes, which shortens the total assay time by more than 120 min, analyzing 10 samples in a duplicated manner. Using this method, we examined 102 Japanese Black cattle and found that 8.8% of the cattle were CHS-carriers. These data indicate that our technique is useful for routine diagnostic testing for CHS in Japanese Black cattle.

Chédiak-Higashi syndrome (CHS) is a rare autosomal recessive disorder characterized by immunodeficiency, neurological dysfunction, and oculocutaneous albinism. Recently, several clinical CHS phenotypes have been reported. Here, we report results of a nationwide survey performed to clarify clinical characteristics and outcomes of CHS patients in Japan. Questionnaires were sent to 287 institutions to collect data regarding CHS patients diagnosed between 2000 and 2010, including results of lysosomal trafficking regulator (LYST) gene analysis. Cytotoxicity and degranulation activity of cytotoxic T lymphocytes were analyzed in available patient samples. A total of 15 patients diagnosed with CHS were eligible for enrollment in this study. Of these, 10 (67%) had recurrent bacterial infections, five (33%) developed life-threatening hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis (HLH), and one patient had complicated malignant lymphoma. Hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) was performed for six patients including three with HLH, and 10 of the enrolled patients have survived at the time of this writing. LYST analysis was performed for 10 patients; seven different mutations were detected in seven patients, whereas no mutation was identified in three patients. Cytotoxicity and degranulation activity were impaired in patients with and without LYST mutation. Results of this survey indicate that one or two patients with CHS were newly diagnosed each year in Japan. The incidence of HLH was not as high as expected. Mutations of genes other than LYST were suspected in some cases. We conclude that determining indication for HSCT for CHS patients should be based on genetic and cytotoxic analysis.

Haemophagocytic syndrome (HS) is a common manifestation of several congenital disorders characterised by a disruption of lysosomal secretion, interrupting the cytolytic pathway and triggering a dysfunction in the immune synapse. In this situation, the recognition of certain extra-immunological manifestations may help in the diagnostic process. We describe the clinical and biological features present in two brothers with familial haemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis type 3 (FHL-3), two patients with Griscelli syndrome type 2 (GS-2) and one patient with Chédiak-Higashi syndrome (CHS). Mutational assays at UNC13D were carried out on two brothers after diagnosing an early onset HS in the first one, yielding a positive result in both cases with a consequent diagnosis of FHL-3. The diagnosis of GS-2 was supported by positive results of mutational Rab27A studies in one patient with HS and abnormal pigmentation, and in her cousin who was affected by a similar abnormal pigmentation. The diagnosis of CHS was established in one patient with HS, abnormal pigmentation and atypical granules on cytological examination of a bone marrow smear. Diagnosis was confirmed in this patient by the finding of a homozygous LYST mutation. We point out the importance of recognising the presence of typical extra-immunological manifestations of certain congenital disorders of lysosome secretion in patients diagnosed with HS. The association of albinism and immunodeficiency has played a critical role in the recent identification of the molecular mechanism involved in these disorders.
