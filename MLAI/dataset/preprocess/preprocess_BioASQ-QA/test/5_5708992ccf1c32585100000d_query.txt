What is the RESID database?

[PMID: 12520062]
The RESID Database is a comprehensive collection of annotations and structures for protein pre-, co- and post-translational modifications including amino-terminal, carboxyl-terminal and peptide chain cross-link modifications. The RESID Database includes: systematic and alternate names, atomic formulas and masses, enzyme activities generating the modifications, keywords, literature citations, Gene Ontology cross-references, Protein Information Resource (PIR) and SWISS-PROT protein sequence database feature table annotations, structure diagrams and molecular models. This database is freely accessible on the Internet through the European Bioinformatics Institute at http://srs.ebi.ac.uk/srs6bin/cgi-bin/wgetz?-page+LibInfo+-lib+RESID, through the National Cancer Institute - Frederick Advanced Biomedical Computing Center at http://www.ncifcrf.gov/RESID, or through the Protein Information Resource at http://pir.georgetown.edu/pirwww/dbinfo/resid.html.

The RESID Database of Protein Modifications is a comprehensive collection of annotations and structures for protein modifications and cross-links including pre-, co-, and post-translational modifications. The database provides: systematic and alternate names, atomic formulas and masses, enzymatic activities that generate the modifications, keywords, literature citations, Gene Ontology (GO) cross-references, protein sequence database feature table annotations, structure diagrams, and molecular models. This database is freely accessible on the Internet through resources provided by the European Bioinformatics Institute (http://www.ebi.ac.uk/RESID), and by the National Cancer Institute--Frederick Advanced Biomedical Computing Center (http://www.ncifcrf.gov/RESID). Each RESID Database entry presents a chemically unique modification and shows how that modification is currently annotated in the protein sequence databases, Swiss-Prot and the Protein Information Resource (PIR). The RESID Database provides a table of corresponding equivalent feature annotations that is used in the UniProt project, an international effort to combine the resources of the Swiss-Prot, TrEMBL and PIR. As an annotation tool, the RESID Database is used in standardizing and enhancing modification descriptions in the feature tables of Swiss-Prot entries. As an Internet resource, the RESID Database assists researchers in high-throughput proteomics to search monoisotopic masses and mass differences and identify known and predicted protein modifications.

Because the number of post-translational modifications requiring standardized annotation in the PIR-International Protein Sequence Database was large and steadily increasing, a database of protein structure modifications was constructed in 1993 to assist in producing appropriate feature annotations for covalent binding sites, modified sites and cross-links. In 1995 RESID was publicly released as a PIR-International text database distributed on CD-ROM and accessible through the ATLAS program. In 1998 it was made available on the PIR Web site at http://www-nbrf.georgetown.edu/pir/searchdb++ +.html . The RESID Database includes such information as: systematic and frequently observed alternate names; Chemical s Service registry numbers; atomic formulas and weights; enzyme activities; indicators forN-terminal, C-terminal or peptide chain cross-link modifications; keywords; and literature citations with database cross-references. The RESID Database can be used to predict atomic masses for peptides, and is being enhanced to provide molecular structures for graphical presentation on the PIR Web site using widely available molecular viewing programs.

The RESID Database is a comprehensive collection of annotations and structures for protein post-translational modifications including N-terminal, C-terminal and peptide chain cross-link modifications. The RESID Database includes systematic and frequently observed alternate names, Chemical Abstracts Service registry numbers, atomic formulas and weights, enzyme activities, taxonomic range, keywords, literature citations with database cross-references, structural diagrams and molecular models. The NRL-3D Sequence-Structure Database is derived from the three-dimensional structure of proteins deposited with the Research Collaboratory for Structural Bioinformatics Protein Data Bank. The NRL-3D Database includes standardized and frequently observed alternate names, sources, keywords, literature citations, experimental conditions and searchable sequences from model coordinates. These databases are freely accessible through the National Cancer Institute-Frederick Advanced Biomedical Computing Center at these web sites: http://www. ncifcrf.gov/RESID, http://www.ncifcrf.gov/NRL-3D; or at these National Biomedical Research Foundation Protein Information Resource web sites: http://pir.georgetown.edu/pirwww/dbinfo/resid .html, http://pir.georgetown.edu/pirwww/dbinfo/nrl3d .html

The RESID Database contains supplemental information on post-translational modifications for the standardized annotations appearing in the PIR-International Protein Sequence Database. The RESID Database includes: systematic and frequently observed alternate names, Chemical s Service registry numbers, atomic formulas and weights, enzyme activities, indicators for N-terminal, C-terminal or peptide chain cross-link modifications, keywords, literature citations with database cross-references, structural diagrams and molecular models. Since 1995 updates of the RESID Database have appeared as often as weekly, and full releases appear quarterly. The database is freely accessible through the PIR Web site http://pir.georgetown.edu/pirwww/dbinfo/resid.html and by FTP.
