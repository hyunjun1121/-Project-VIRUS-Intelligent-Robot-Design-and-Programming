Which is the main component of the Lewy body?

It took almost 100 years before a meaningful advance occurred in any basic science understanding of Parkinson disease (PD) following James Parkinson's description in 1817. The Lewy body was described in 1912, and the substantia nigra was found to be depigmented with neuronal loss and gliosis in 1919. The link between dopamine and PD began in 1957, 140 years after Parkinson's Essay. Arvid Carlsson and Oleh Hornykiewicz were the major pioneers. The revolutionary therapeutic breakthrough was the introduction of high dosage levodopa therapy by George Cotzias in 1967. Following 40 years of the dopa/dopamine era, we have entered the era of alpha-synuclein, the protein present in Lewy bodies. Heiko Braak found that alpha-synuclein accumulates initially in the olfactory system and lower brainstem and then travels in an anatomic pattern to involve other regions of the brain and thereby cause progressive symptoms. Alpha-synuclein was somehow converted to a rogue protein. Where this originates and how it is propagated are under intense investigation. At the same time that the alpha-synuclein era was developing, clinical advances took place by recognizing PD as hosting a wide variety of nonmotor features with eventual cognitive impairment in many. Therapeutics has also evolved. Although the most effective therapy for the motor features remains levodopa, surgical approaches and drugs for nonmotor problems continue to expand our ability to treat people with PD. We can expect therapeutic advances in neuroprotection as the basic science discoveries uncovered in the alpha-synuclein era are translated into effective treatments.

The pesticide rotenone has been shown to cause systemic inhibition of mitochondrial complex I activity, with consequent degeneration of dopamine neurons along the nigrostriatal pathway, as observed in Parkinson's disease (PD). Recently, intracranial infusion of rotenone was found to increase the protein levels of the Lewy body constituents, α-synuclein and small ubiquitin-related modifier-1(SUMO-1), in the lesioned hemisphere of the mouse brain. These findings are supportive of a mouse model of PD, but information about the dopamine-synthesizing enzyme, tyrosine hydroxylase (TH), an essential marker of dopaminergic status, was not reported. Clarification of this issue is important because an intracranial rotenone mouse model of Parkinson's disease has not been established. Towards this end, the present study examined the effects of intracranial rotenone treatment on TH and α-synuclein immunohistochemistry in addition to forelimb motor function. Mice were unilaterally infused with either vehicle or rotenone (2μg/site) in both the medial forebrain bundle and the substantia nigra. The forelimb asymmetry (cylinder) test indicated a significant decrease in use of the contralateral forelimb in lesioned animals as compared to the sham group. Densitometric analysis revealed a significant depletion of TH immunofluorescence within the ipsilateral striatum and substantia nigra of lesioned animals. Moreover, a significant bilateral increase in α-synuclein immunofluorescence was found in the substantia nigra of lesioned mice, as compared to control animals. These findings indicate that this intracranial rotenone mouse model will be useful for studies of neurodegenerative disorders such as PD.

Parkinson's disease (PD) is characterized by bradykinesia, rigidity, postural instability and tremor. Several pathologic processes can produce this syndrome, but neurodegeneration accompanied by neuronal inclusions composed of α-synuclein (Lewy bodies) is considered the typical pathologic correlate of PD. The neuropathologic features of PD are reviewed based upon personal experience and review of the literature. Molecular pathology of PD is summarized from cell biological and animal studies. The pathologic feature that correlates with signs and symptoms of PD is neuronal loss in the substantia nigra with dopaminergic denervation of the striatum. Neuronal degeneration in the substantia nigra preferentially affects the ventrolateral cell group that projects to posterolateral putamen and is accompanied by formation of Lewy bodies composed of aggregated α-synuclein. Some patients with PD are found at autopsy to have other pathologic processes, such as multiple system atrophy, progressive supranuclear palsy and cerebrovascular disease (vascular Parkinsonism). The peripheral autonomic nervous system is also affected. The triggering event in PD is unknown, but recent studies suggest a role for loss of nuclear membrane integrity. Once α-synuclein aggregates forms, evidence supports cell-to-cell propagation. PD is a multisystem synucleinopathy caused by poorly characterized genetic and environmental factors that produces degeneration in selectively vulnerable neuronal populations.

Neuronal loss in specific brain regions and neurons with intracellular inclusions termed Lewy bodies are the pathologic hallmark in both Parkinson's disease (PD) and dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB). Lewy bodies comprise of aggregated intracellular vesicles and proteins and α-synuclein is reported to be a major protein component. Using human brain tissue from control, PD and DLB and light and confocal immunohistochemistry with antibodies to superoxide dismutase 2 as a marker for mitochondria, α-synuclein for Lewy bodies and βIII Tubulin for microtubules we have examined the relationship between Lewy bodies and mitochondrial loss. We have shown microtubule regression and mitochondrial and nuclear degradation in neurons with developing Lewy bodies. In PD, multiple Lewy bodies were often observed with α-synuclein interacting with DNA to cause marked nuclear degradation. In DLB, the mitochondria are drawn into the Lewy body and the mitochondrial integrity is lost. This work suggests that Lewy bodies are cytotoxic. In DLB, we suggest that microtubule regression and mitochondrial loss results in decreased cellular energy and axonal transport that leads to cell death. In PD, α-synuclein aggregations are associated with intact mitochondria but interacts with and causes nuclear degradation which may be the major cause of cell death.
