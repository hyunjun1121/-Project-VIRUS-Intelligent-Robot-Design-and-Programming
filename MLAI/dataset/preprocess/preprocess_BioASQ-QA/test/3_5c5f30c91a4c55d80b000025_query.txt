During inflammation lymphatic vessels (LVs) are enlarged and their density is increased to facilitate the migration of activated immune cells and antigens. However, after antigen clearance, the expanded LVs shrink to maintain homeostasis. Here we show that interleukin (IL)-17A, secreted from T helper type 17 (T<sub>H</sub>17) cells, is a negative regulator of lymphangiogenesis during the resolution phase of T<sub>H</sub>17-mediated immune responses. Moreover, IL-17A suppresses the expression of major lymphatic markers in lymphatic endothelial cells and decreases in vitro LV formation. To investigate the role of IL-17A in vivo, we utilized a cholera toxin-mediated inflammation model and identified inflammation and resolution phases based on the numbers of recruited immune cells. IL-17A, markedly produced by T<sub>H</sub>17 cells even after the peak of inflammation, was found to participate in the negative regulation of LV formation. Moreover, blockade of IL-17A resulted in not only increased density of LVs in tissues but also their enhanced function. Taken together, these findings improve the current understanding of the relationship between LVs and inflammatory cytokines in pathologic conditions.

Graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) is the major cause of nonrelapse morbidity and mortality after allogeneic stem cell transplantation (allo-SCT). Prevention and treatment of GVHD remain inadequate and commonly lead to end-organ dysfunction and opportunistic infection. The role of interleukin (IL)-17 and IL-22 in GVHD remains uncertain, due to an apparent lack of lineage fidelity and variable and contextually determined protective and pathogenic effects. We demonstrate that donor T cell-derived IL-22 significantly exacerbates cutaneous chronic GVHD and that IL-22 is produced by highly inflammatory donor CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells posttransplantation. IL-22 and IL-17A derive from both independent and overlapping lineages, defined as T helper (Th)22 and IL-22<sup>+</sup> Th17 cells. Donor Th22 and IL-22<sup>+</sup> Th17 cells share a similar IL-6-dependent developmental pathway, and while Th22 cells arise independently of the IL-22<sup>+</sup> Th17 lineage, IL-17 signaling to donor Th22 directly promotes their development in allo-SCT. Importantly, while both IL-22 and IL-17 mediate skin GVHD, Th17-induced chronic GVHD can be attenuated by IL-22 inhibition in preclinical systems. In the clinic, high levels of both IL-17A and IL-22 expression are present in the skin of patients with GVHD after allo-SCT. Together, these data demonstrate a key role for donor-derived IL-22 in patients with chronic skin GVHD and confirm parallel but symbiotic developmental pathways of Th22 and Th17 differentiation.

Millions of children are affected by different neurodevelopmental disorders, out of which autism spectrum disorder (ASD) poses a major hurdle to normal life style due to associated behavioral abnormalities. Several studies have shown an increased expression/release of Th17 related cytokine, IL-17A in ASD. IL-17A may enhance neuroinflammation via its IL-17A receptor, i.e. IL-17RA expressed in immune cells (such as monocytes) of autistic children. Increased oxidative stress has been implicated in a number of neuropsychiatric disorders including ASD. However, whether IL-17A/IL-17RA signaling contributes to oxidative inflammation in monocytes of autistic children has not been explored previously. With this background, we performed this study in peripheral monocytes of ASD patients and age-matched typically developing children. Our study shows that ASD individuals have increased IL-17RA expression in monocytes which is associated with increased nuclear factor kappa-light-chain-enhancer of activated B cells (NFκB) pathway and inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS)/nitrotyrosine expression as compared to typically developing children. Moreover, in vitro activation of IL-17 receptor by IL-17A in monocytes isolated from ASD individuals leads to enhanced iNOS expression via NFκB pathway. IL-17RA antibody treatment in vitro reversed IL-17A-induced increase in NFκB and iNOS/nitrotyrosine expression in monocytes isolated from ASD subjects. These data connect increased IL-17A/IL-17RA signaling in ASD patients with enhanced oxidative inflammation in monocytes. Therefore, IL-17 receptor signaling in monocytes may potentiate the effects of IL-17A released by other immune cells and may aggravate neuroinflammation in ASD. Our study further suggests that blockade of IL-17A/IL-17 receptor signaling may be beneficial in the children with ASD.
