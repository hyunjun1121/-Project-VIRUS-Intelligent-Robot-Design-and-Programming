What is the exoproteome?

[PMID: 28137564]
Pathogens are known to release in their environment a large range of toxins and other virulence factors. Their pathogenicity relies on this arsenal of exoproteins and their orchestrated release upon changing environmental conditions. Exoproteomics aims at describing and quantifying the proteins found outside of the cells, thus takes advantage of the most recent methodologies of next-generation proteomics. This approach has been applied with great success to a variety of pathogens increasing the fundamental knowledge on pathogenicity. In this chapter, we describe how the exoproteome should be prepared and handled for high-throughput identification of exoproteins and their quantitation by label-free shotgun proteomics. We also mentioned some bioinformatics tools for extracting information such as toxin similarity search.

Wound-colonizing microorganisms can form complex and dynamic polymicrobial communities where pathogens and commensals may co-exist, cooperate or compete with each other. The present study was aimed at identifying possible interactions between different bacteria isolated from the same chronic wound of a patient with the genetic blistering disease epidermolysis bullosa (EB). Specifically, this involved two different isolates of the human pathogen Staphylococcus aureus, and isolates of Bacillus thuringiensis and Klebsiella oxytoca. Particular focus was attributed to interactions of S. aureus with the two other species, because of the high staphylococcal prevalence among chronic wounds. Intriguingly, upon co-cultivation, none of the wound isolates inhibited each other's growth. Since the extracellular proteome of bacterial pathogens is a reservoir of virulence factors, the exoproteomes of the staphylococcal isolates in monoculture and co-culture with B. thuringiensis and K. oxytoca were characterized by Mass Spectrometry to explore the inherent relationships between these co-exisiting bacteria. This revealed a massive reduction in the number of staphylococcal exoproteins upon co-culturing with K. oxytoca or B. thuringiensis. Interestingly, this decrease was particularly evident for extracellular proteins with a predicted cytoplasmic localization, which were recently implicated in staphylococcal virulence and epidemiology. Furthermore, our exoproteome analysis uncovered potential cooperativity between the two different S. aureus isolates. Altogether, the observed exoproteome variations upon co-culturing are indicative of unprecedented adaptive mechanisms that set limits to the production of secreted staphylococcal virulence factors.

Proteins that mediate cellular and subcellular membrane fusion are key factors in vesicular trafficking in all eukaryotic cells, including the secretion and transport of plant pathogen virulence factors. In this study, we identified vesicle-fusion components that included 22 soluble N-ethylmaleimide-sensitive factor attachment protein receptors (SNAREs), four Sec1/Munc18 (SM) family proteins, and 10 Rab GTPases encoded in the genome of the vascular wilt pathogen Verticillium dahliae Vd991. Targeted deletion of two SNARE-encoding genes in V. dahliae, VdSec22 and VdSso1, significantly reduced virulence of both mutants on cotton, relative to the wild-type Vd991 strain. Comparative analyses of the secreted protein content (exoproteome) revealed that many enzymes involved in carbohydrate hydrolysis were regulated by VdSec22 or VdSso1. Consistent with a role of these enzymes in plant cell-wall degradation, pectin, cellulose, and xylan utilization were reduced in the VdSec22 or VdSso1 mutant strains along with a loss of exoproteome cytotoxic activity on cotton leaves. Comparisons with a pathogenicity-related exoproteome revealed that several known virulence factors were not regulated by VdSec22 or VdSso1, but some of the proteins regulated by VdSec22 or VdSso1 displayed different characteristics, including the lack of a typical signal peptide, suggesting that V. dahliae employs more than one secretory route to transport proteins to extracellular sites during infection.
