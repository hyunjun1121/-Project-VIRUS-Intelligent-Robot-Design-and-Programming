Which receptor is blocked by Finerenone?

[PMID: 28025025]
Finerenone (BAY 94-8862) is a novel non-steroidal mineralocorticoid receptor antagonist. The aim of this study was to compare the efficacy and safety of seven once-daily oral doses of finerenone (1.25-20mg) and placebo in 96 patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) and diabetic nephropathy (DN) receiving a RAS blocker. ARTS-DN Japan was a multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, phase 2b study. Analysis of the urinary albumin-to-creatinine ratio (UACR) at day 90 relative to baseline indicated a nominally significant effect of finerenone. The UACR at day 90 relative to baseline for each finerenone treatment group was numerically reduced compared with placebo. No serious adverse events (AEs) or deaths were reported and no patients experienced treatment-emergent AEs resulting in discontinuation of study drug. Small mean increases in serum potassium level were observed in the finerenone treatment groups (0.025-0.167mmol/L) compared with the placebo group (-0.075mmol/L); no patients developed hyperkalemia. When given in addition to a RAS inhibitor, finerenone reduced albuminuria without adverse effects on serum potassium levels or renal function in Japanese patients with T2DM and DN.

Development of albuminuria and arterial stiffness in Munich Wistar Frömter (MWF) rats, a model of chronic kidney disease, is related to alterations in extracellular matrix, increased oxidative stress, and endothelial dysfunction. Finerenone (FIN), a novel, nonsteroidal, potent, and selective mineralocorticoid receptor antagonist, improves endothelial dysfunction through enhancing nitric oxide (NO) bioavailability and decreasing superoxide anion levels due to an upregulation in vascular and renal superoxide dismutase activity. We hypothesize that FIN reduces arterial stiffness in this model associated to the reduction in albuminuria and matrix metalloproteinase (MMP)-2/9 activity. Twelve-week-old MWF rats with established albuminuria and age-matched normoalbuminuric Wistar (W) rats were treated with FIN (10 mg/kg/day, once-daily oral gavage) or with vehicle (control, C) for 4 weeks. Arterial stiffness was significantly higher in mesenteric arteries (MA) of MWF-C as compared to W-C. FIN treatment significantly lowered β-index, a measure of intrinsic stiffness independent of geometry, in MWF (βMWF-FIN = 7.7 ± 0.4 vs. βMWF-C = 9.2 ± 0.5, p < 0.05) positively correlating with urinary albumin excretion. Elastin fenestrae area in the internal elastic lamina of MA from MWF-FIN was significantly larger (+377%, p < 0.05). FIN increased plasma pro-MMP-2 and decreased plasma MMP-2 and MMP-9 activities, correlating with reductions in β-index. MA from MWF-FIN exhibited higher NO bioavailability and reduced superoxide anion levels compared to MWF-C. FIN treatment reduces intrinsic arterial stiffness in MA from MWF rats associated with changes in elastin organization, normalization of MMP-2 and MMP-9 activities, and reduction of oxidative stress. Moreover, reduction of arterial stiffness correlates with reduction in albuminuria.

The novel nonsteroidal mineralocorticoid receptor (MR) antagonist finerenone holds promise to be safe and efficient in the treatment of patients with heart failure and/or chronic kidney disease. However, its effects on vascular function remain elusive. The aim of this study was to determine the functional effect of selective MR antagonism by finerenone in vascular cells in vitro and the effect on vascular remodeling following acute vascular injury in vivo. In vitro, finerenone dose-dependently reduced aldosterone-induced smooth muscle cell (SMC) proliferation, as quantified by BrdU incorporation, and prevented aldosterone-induced endothelial cell (EC) apoptosis, as measured with a flow cytometry based caspase 3/7 activity assay. In vivo, oral application of finerenone resulted in an accelerated re-endothelialization 3 days following electric injury of the murine carotid artery. Furthermore, finerenone treatment inhibited intimal and medial cell proliferation following wire-induced injury of the murine femoral artery 10 days following injury and attenuated neointimal lesion formation 21 days following injury. Finerenone significantly reduces apoptosis of ECs and simultaneously attenuates SMC proliferation, resulting in accelerated endothelial healing and reduced neointima formation of the injured vessels. Thus, finerenone appears to provide favorable vascular effects through restoring vascular integrity and preventing adverse vascular remodeling.

Mass balance and biotransformation of finerenone, a nonsteroidal mineralocorticoid receptor antagonist, were investigated in four healthy male volunteers following a single oral administration of 10 mg (78 <i>μ</i>Ci) of [<sup>14</sup>C]finerenone and compared with data from studies in dogs and rats. The total recovery of the administered radioactivity was 101% in humans, 94.7% in dogs, and 95.2% in rats. In humans, radioactivity was mainly excreted renally (80%); in rats, it was primarily the biliary/fecal route (76%); and in dogs, excretion was more balanced. Finerenone was extensively metabolized in all species by oxidative biotransformation, with minor amounts of unchanged drug in excreta (humans: 1%; dogs, rats: <9%). In vitro studies suggested cytochrome P450 3A4 was the predominant enzyme involved in finerenone metabolism in humans. Primary metabolic transformation involved aromatization of the dihydronaphthyridine moiety of metabolite M1 as a major clearance pathway with a second oxidative pathway leading to M4. These were both prone to further oxidative biotransformation reactions. Naphthyridine metabolites (M1-M3) were the dominant metabolites identified in human plasma, with no on-target pharmacological activity. In dog plasma, finerenone and metabolite M2 constituted the major components; finerenone accounted almost exclusively for drug-related material in rat plasma. For metabolites M1-M3, axial chirality was observed, represented by two atropisomers (e.g., M1a and M1b). Analysis of plasma and excreta showed one atropisomer (a-series, >79%) of each metabolite predominated in all three species. In summary, the present study demonstrates that finerenone is cleared by oxidative biotransformation, mainly via naphthyridine derivatives.

Albuminuria is an early marker of renovascular damage associated to an increase in oxidative stress. The Munich Wistar Frömter (MWF) rat is a model of chronic kidney disease (CKD), which exhibits endothelial dysfunction associated to low nitric oxide availability. We hypothesize that the new highly selective, non-steroidal mineralocorticoid receptor (MR) antagonist, finerenone, reverses both endothelial dysfunction and microalbuminuria. Twelve-week-old MWF (MWF-C; MWF-FIN) and aged-matched normoalbuminuric Wistar (W-C; W-FIN) rats were treated with finerenone (FIN, 10 mg/kg/day p.o.) or vehicle (C) for 4-week. Systolic blood pressure (SBP) and albuminuria were determined the last day of treatment. Finerenone lowered albuminuria by >40% and significantly reduced SBP in MWF. Aortic rings of MWF-C showed higher contractions to either noradrenaline (NA) or angiotensin II (Ang II), and lower relaxation to acetylcholine (Ach) than W-C rings. These alterations were reversed by finerenone to W-C control levels due to an upregulation in phosphorylated Akt and eNOS, and an increase in NO availability. Apocynin and 3-amino-1,2,4-triazole significantly reduced contractions to NA or Ang II in MWF-C, but not in MWF-FIN rings. Accordingly, a significant increase of Mn-superoxide dismutase (SOD) and Cu/Zn-SOD protein levels were observed in rings of MWF-FIN, without differences in p22phox, p47phox or catalase levels. Total SOD activity was increased in kidneys from MWF-FIN rats. In conclusion, finerenone improves endothelial dysfunction through an enhancement in NO bioavailability and a decrease in superoxide anion levels due to an upregulation in SOD activity. This is associated with an increase in renal SOD activity and a reduction of albuminuria.

Aldosterone regulates sodium homeostasis by activating the mineralocorticoid receptor (MR), a member of the nuclear receptor superfamily. Hyperaldosteronism leads todeleterious effects on the kidney, blood vessels, and heart. Although steroidal antagonists such as spironolactone and eplerenone are clinically useful for the treatment of cardiovascular diseases, they are associated with several side effects. Finerenone, a novel nonsteroidal MR antagonist, is presently being evaluated in two clinical phase IIb trials. Here, we characterized the molecular mechanisms of action of finerenone and spironolactone at several key steps of the MR signaling pathway. Molecular modeling and mutagenesis approaches allowed identification of Ser-810 and Ala-773 as key residues for the high MR selectivity of finerenone. Moreover, we showed that, in contrast to spironolactone, which activates the S810L mutant MR responsible for a severe form of early onset hypertension, finerenone displays strict antagonistic properties. Aldosterone-dependent phosphorylation and degradation of MR are inhibited by both finerenone and spironolactone. However, automated quantification of MR subcellular distribution demonstrated that finerenone delays aldosterone-induced nuclear accumulation of MR more efficiently than spironolactone. Finally, chromatin immunoprecipitation assays revealed that, as opposed to spironolactone, finerenone inhibits MR, steroid receptor coactivator-1, and RNA polymerase II binding at the regulatory sequence of the SCNN1A gene and also remarkably reduces basal MR and steroid receptor coactivator-1 recruitment, unraveling a specific and unrecognized inactivating mechanism on MR signaling. Overall, our data demonstrate that the highly potent and selective MR antagonist finerenone specifically impairs several critical steps of the MR signaling pathway and therefore represents a promising new generation MR antagonist.

Pharmaceutical antagonism of the mineralocorticoid receptor (MR) can protect against organ damage caused by elevated aldosterone levels in patients experiencing heart failure (HF), chronic kidney disease (CKD), primary aldosteronism, and hypertension. While traditional steroid-based MR antagonists effectively reduce mortality rates and extend patient survival, their broad application has been limited by significant side effects, most notably hyperkalaemia. Recently, finerenone (BAY 94-8862) has emerged as a next-generation non-steroidal dihydropyridine-based MR antagonist designed to minimize off-target effects while maintaining potent efficacy. In this review, the outcomes of finerenone therapy in several diseases associated with MR activity are explored. The (pre-) clinical efficacy of finerenone is compared with that of traditional steroid-based MR antagonists. Finally, recent and ongoing clinical trials using finerenone to treat chronic HF, CKD, and diabetic nephropathy are discussed. Taken together, pre-clinical and clinical evidence suggests that finerenone may achieve equivalent organ-protective effects with reduced levels of electrolyte disturbance compared with traditional steroid-based MR antagonists. This supports further clinical development of finerenone for the treatment of cardiovascular and renal disease.

Mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists (MRAs) reduce morbidity and mortality in chronic heart failure. Novel nonsteroidal MRAs are currently developed and need to be pharmacologically characterized in comparison to classical steroidal MRAs. A mouse model of cardiac fibrosis induced by short-term isoproterenol injection was used to compare the nonsteroidal MRA finerenone and the steroidal MRA eplerenone in equi-efficient systemic MR blocking dosages. Molecular mechanisms were studied in MR-expressing H9C2/MR+ cardiomyocytes and in MR transcriptional cofactor binding assays. Both MRAs significantly inhibited an isoproterenol-mediated increase of left ventricular mass. Isoproterenol-induced cardiac fibrosis and macrophage invasion were potently blocked by finerenone, whereas eplerenone had no significant effect. Speckle tracking echocardiography revealed a significant improvement of global longitudinal peak strain by finerenone, an effect less prominent with eplerenone. Antifibrotic actions of finerenone were accompanied by a significant inhibition of profibrotic cardiac <i>TNX</i> (<i>tenascin-X</i>) expression, a regulation absent with eplerenone. Finally, we show a higher potency/efficacy and inverse agonism of finerenone versus eplerenone in MR transcriptional cofactor binding assays indicating differential MR cofactor modulation by steroidal and nonsteroidal MRAs. This study demonstrates that the nonsteroidal MRA finerenone potently prevents cardiac fibrosis and improves strain parameters in mice. Cardiac antifibrotic actions of finerenone may result from the inhibition of profibrotic TNX gene expression mediated by differential MR cofactor binding. Selective MR cofactor modulation provides a molecular basis for distinct (pre)-clinical actions of nonsteroidal and steroidal MRAs.

Finerenone is a selective, non-steroidal mineralocorticoid receptor antagonist. In vivo and in vitro studies were performed to assess absolute bioavailability of finerenone, the effect of metabolic enzyme inhibitors on the pharmacokinetics of finerenone and its metabolites, the quantitative contribution of the involved enzymes cytochrome P450 (CYP) 3A4 and CYP2C8 and the relevance of gut wall versus liver metabolism. The pharmacokinetics, safety and tolerability of finerenone (1.25-10 mg orally or 0.25-1.0 mg intravenously) were evaluated in healthy male volunteers in four crossover studies. Absolute bioavailability was assessed in volunteers receiving finerenone orally and by intravenous infusion (n = 15) and the effects of erythromycin (n = 15), verapamil (n = 13) and gemfibrozil (n = 16) on finerenone pharmacokinetics were investigated. Finerenone was also incubated with cryopreserved human hepatocytes in vitro in the presence of erythromycin, verapamil or gemfibrozil. Finerenone absolute bioavailability was 43.5% due to first-pass metabolism in the gut wall and liver. The geometric mean AUC<sub>0-∞</sub> ratios of finerenone (drug + inhibitor/drug alone) were 3.48, 2.70 and 1.10 with erythromycin, verapamil and gemfibrozil, respectively. The contribution ratio of CYP3A4 to the metabolic clearance of finerenone derived from these values was 0.88-0.89 and was consistent with estimations based on in vitro data, with the remaining metabolic clearance due to CYP2C8 involvement. Finerenone is predominantly metabolized by CYP3A4 in the gut wall and liver. Increases in systemic exposure upon concomitant administration of inhibitors of this isoenzyme are predictable and consistent with in vitro data. Inhibition of CYP2C8, the second involved metabolic enzyme, has no relevant effect on finerenone in vivo.

Among people with diabetes, those with kidney disease have exceptionally high rates of cardiovascular (CV) morbidity and mortality and progression of their underlying kidney disease. Finerenone is a novel, nonsteroidal, selective mineralocorticoid receptor antagonist that has shown to reduce albuminuria in type 2 diabetes (T2D) patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD) while revealing only a low risk of hyperkalemia. However, the effect of finerenone on CV and renal outcomes has not yet been investigated in long-term trials. The Finerenone in Reducing CV Mortality and Morbidity in Diabetic Kidney Disease (FIGARO-DKD) trial aims to assess the efficacy and safety of finerenone compared to placebo at reducing clinically important CV and renal outcomes in T2D patients with CKD. FIGARO-DKD is a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel-group, event-driven trial running in 47 countries with an expected duration of approximately 6 years. FIGARO-DKD randomized 7,437 patients with an estimated glomerular filtration rate ≥25 mL/min/1.73 m2 and albuminuria (urinary albumin-to-creatinine ratio ≥30 to ≤5,000 mg/g). The study has at least 90% power to detect a 20% reduction in the risk of the primary outcome (overall two-sided significance level α = 0.05), the composite of time to first occurrence of CV death, nonfatal myocardial infarction, nonfatal stroke, or hospitalization for heart failure. FIGARO-DKD will determine whether an optimally treated cohort of T2D patients with CKD at high risk of CV and renal events will experience cardiorenal benefits with the addition of finerenone to their treatment regimen.

Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) is an X-linked inherited disease due to dystrophin deficiency causing skeletal and cardiac muscle dysfunction. Affected patients lose ambulation by age 12 and usually die in the second to third decades of life from cardiac and respiratory failure. Symptomatic treatment includes the use of anti-inflammatory corticosteroids, which are associated with side effects including weight gain, osteoporosis, and increased risk of cardiovascular disease. Novel treatment options include blockade of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system, because angiotensin as well as aldosterone contribute to persistent inflammation and fibrosis, and aldosterone blockade represents an efficacious anti-fibrotic approach in cardiac failure. Recent preclinical findings enabled successful clinical testing of a combination of steroidal mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists (MRAs) and angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors in DMD boys. The efficacy of MRAs alone on dystrophic skeletal muscle and heart has not been investigated. Here, we tested efficacy of the novel non-steroidal MRA finerenone as a monotherapy in a preclinical DMD model. The dystrophin-deficient, utrophin haploinsufficient mouse model of DMD was treated with finerenone and compared with untreated dystrophic and wild-type controls. Grip strength, electrocardiography, cardiac magnetic resonance imaging, muscle force measurements, histological quantification, and gene expression studies were performed. Finerenone treatment alone resulted in significant improvements in clinically relevant functional parameters in both skeletal muscle and heart. Normalized grip strength in rested dystrophic mice treated with finerenone (40.3 ± 1.0 mN/g) was significantly higher (P = 0.0182) compared with untreated dystrophic mice (35.2 ± 1.5 mN/g). Fatigued finerenone-treated dystrophic mice showed an even greater relative improvement (P = 0.0003) in normalized grip strength (37.5 ± 1.1 mN/g) compared with untreated mice (29.7 ± 1.1 mN/g). Finerenone treatment also led to significantly lower (P = 0.0075) susceptibility to limb muscle damage characteristic of DMD measured during a contraction-induced injury protocol. Normalized limb muscle force after five lengthening contractions resulted in retention of 71 ± 7% of baseline force in finerenone-treated compared with only 51 ± 4% in untreated dystrophic mice. Finerenone treatment also prevented significant reductions in myocardial strain rate (P = 0.0409), the earliest sign of DMD cardiomyopathy. Moreover, treatment with finerenone led to very specific cardiac gene expression changes in clock genes that might modify cardiac pathophysiology in this DMD model. Finerenone administered as a monotherapy is disease modifying for both skeletal muscle and heart in a preclinical DMD model. These findings support further evaluation of finerenone in DMD clinical trials.

Acute kidney injury induced by ischemia/reperfusion (IR) is a frequent complication in hospitalized patients. Mineralocorticoid receptor antagonism has shown to be helpful against renal IR consequences; however, the potential benefit of novel nonsteroidal mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists such as finerenone has to be further explored. In this study, we evaluated the efficacy of finerenone to prevent the acute and chronic consequences of ischemic acute kidney injury. For the acute study (24 hours), 18 rats were divided into sham, bilateral renal ischemia of 25 minutes, and rats that received 3 doses of finerenone at 48, 24, and 1 hour before the ischemia. For the chronic study (4 months), 23 rats were divided into sham, rats that underwent 45 minutes of bilateral ischemia, and rats treated with finerenone at days 2 and 1 and 1 hour before IR. We found that after 24 hours of reperfusion, the untreated IR rats presented kidney dysfunction and tubular injury. Kidney injury molecule-1 and neutrophil gelatinase associated to lipolacin mRNA levels were increased. In contrast, the rats treated with finerenone displayed normal kidney function and significantly lesser tubular injury and kidney injury molecule-1 and neutrophil gelatinase associated to lipolacin levels. After 4 months, the IR rats developed chronic kidney disease, evidenced by kidney dysfunction, increased proteinuria and renal vascular resistance, tubular dilation, extensive tubule-interstitial fibrosis, and an increase in kidney transforming growth factor-β and collagen-I mRNA. The transition from acute kidney injury to chronic kidney disease was fully prevented by finerenone. Altogether, our data show that in the rat, finerenone is able to prevent acute kidney injury induced by IR and the chronic and progressive deterioration of kidney function and structure.

We aim to review the mechanism of action and safety profile of mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists (MRAs) and discuss the differences between selective and non-selective MRAs. More specifically, finerenone is a new medication that is currently under investigation for its promising cardiovascular and nephrological effects. MRAs are well known for their utility in treating heart failure, refractory hypertension, and diverse nephropathies, namely, diabetic nephropathy. As their name denotes, MRAs inhibit the action of aldosterone at the mineralocorticoid receptor, preventing receptor activation. This prevents remodeling, decreases inflammation, and improves proteinuria. There are not significant differences in outcomes between selective and non-selective MRAs. A new selective MRA named finerenone (originally BAY 94-8862) has shown promising results in several trials (ARTS-HF and ARTS-DN) and smaller studies. Finerenone may have a dose-dependent benefit over older MRAs, decreasing rates of albuminuria and levels of BNP and NT-ProBNP without causing a significant increase in serum potassium levels. This medication is not yet approved as it is still in phase 3 clinical trials (FIGARO-DKD and FIDELIO-DKD trials). MRAs are beneficial in several disease states. Newer medications, such as finerenone, should be considered in patients with heart failure and diabetic nephropathy who may benefit from a reduction in albuminuria and BNP/NT-ProBNP. Data surrounding finerenone are limited to date. However, results from ongoing clinical trials, as well as new trials to evaluate use in other pathologies, could validate the implementation of this medication in daily practice.

Steroidal mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists, when added to a renin-angiotensin system blocker, further reduce proteinuria in patients with chronic kidney disease but may be underused because of a high risk of adverse events. To evaluate the safety and efficacy of different oral doses of the nonsteroidal mineralocorticoid receptor antagonist finerenone, given for 90 days to patients with diabetes and high or very high albuminuria who are receiving an angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor or an angiotensin receptor blocker. Randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel-group study conducted at 148 sites in 23 countries. Patients were recruited from June 2013 to February 2014 and the study was completed in August 2014. Of 1501 screened patients, 823 were randomized and 821 received study drug. Participants were randomly assigned to receive oral, once-daily finerenone (1.25 mg/d, n = 96; 2.5 mg/d, n = 92; 5 mg/d, n = 100; 7.5 mg/d, n = 97; 10 mg/d, n = 98; 15 mg/d, n = 125; and 25 mg/d, n = 119) or matching placebo (n = 94) for 90 days. The primary outcome was the ratio of the urinary albumin-creatinine ratio (UACR) at day 90 vs at baseline. Safety end points were changes from baseline in serum potassium and estimated glomerular filtration rate. The mean age of the participants was 64.2 years; 78% were male. At baseline, 36.7% of patients treated had very high albuminuria (UACR ≥300 mg/g) and 40.0% had an estimated glomerular filtration rate of 60 mL/min/1.73 m2 or lower. Finerenone demonstrated a dose-dependent reduction in UACR. The primary outcome, the placebo-corrected mean ratio of the UACR at day 90 relative to baseline, was reduced in the finerenone 7.5-, 10-, 15-, and 20-mg/d groups (for 7.5 mg/d, 0.79 [90% CI, 0.68-0.91; P = .004]; for 10 mg/d, 0.76 [90% CI, 0.65-0.88; P = .001]; for 15 mg/d, 0.67 [90% CI, 0.58-0.77; P<.001]; for 20 mg/d, 0.62 [90% CI, 0.54-0.72; P < .001]). The prespecified secondary outcome of hyperkalemia leading to discontinuation was not observed in the placebo and finerenone 10-mg/d groups; incidences in the finerenone 7.5-, 15-, and 20-mg/d groups were 2.1%, 3.2%, and 1.7%, respectively. There were no differences in the incidence of the prespecified secondary outcome of an estimated glomerular filtration rate decrease of 30% or more or in incidences of adverse events and serious adverse events between the placebo and finerenone groups. Among patients with diabetic nephropathy, most receiving an angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor or an angiotensin receptor blocker, the addition of finerenone compared with placebo resulted in improvement in the urinary albumin-creatinine ratio. Further trials are needed to compare finerenone with other active medications. clinicaltrials.gov Identifier: NCT1874431.

The non-steroidal mineralocorticoid receptor antagonist finerenone (BAY 94-8862) has been used to treat chronic heart failure (CHF) with reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF). However, conflicting results were reported for its efficacy and safety. The study aimed to compare the efficacy and safety of finerenone versus spironolactone or eplerenone in patients with chronic heart failure. Electronic databases including MEDLINE, EMBASE, and CENTRAL were searched from inception to December 2017 for randomized controlled trials assessing finerenone treatment in patients with chronic heart failure. Data concerning the study's design, patients' characteristics, and outcomes were extracted. Risk ratio (RR) and mean differences (MD) were calculated using either fixed or random effects models. Three trials with 1520 CHF patients were included in the systematic review. In terms of anti-ventricular remodeling, we calculated the effective number of cases with a 30% reduction in NT-proBNP. Finerenone was equivalent to the existing steroidal mineralocorticoid antagonist (P < .05). However, the efficacy of finerenone appeared to be dose-dependent. At a dose of 10 mg/d finerenone was found to be marginally better than that of steroidal mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists (MRAs) (RR = 1.18, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.88, 1.57, P > .05). The incidence of treatment-related adverse events (TEAEs) of finerenone at 10 mg/d was significantly lower than 25 to 50 mg/d of steroidal MRAs (RR = 0.81, 95% CI = 0.66-0.99, P = .04). Moreover, the serum potassium levels in the finerenone 10 mg/d group were lower than those in the 25 to 50 mg/d steroidal MRAs group (MD = -0.14, 95% CI -0.30-0.02, P = .09), whereas the estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) was higher in finerenone versus steroidal MRAs treated patients (MD = 2.07, 95% CI -0.04-4.17, P = .05). Finerenone reduced NT-proBNP level, urinary albumin/creatinine ratio (UACR), and other biochemical indicators, in a dose-dependent manner. In terms of anti-ventricular remodeling in patient with chronic heart failure, finerenone at 10 mg/d is as effective as 20 to 50 mg/d of steroidal MRAs. However, finerenone is much safer to patients with chronic kidney disease.

This review covers the last 80 years of remarkable progress in the development of mineralocorticoid receptor (MR) antagonists (MRAs) from synthesis of the first mineralocorticoid to trials of nonsteroidal MRAs. The MR is a nuclear receptor expressed in many tissues/cell types including the kidney, heart, immune cells, and fibroblasts. The MR directly affects target gene expression-primarily fluid, electrolyte and haemodynamic homeostasis, and also, but less appreciated, tissue remodelling. Pathophysiological overactivation of the MR leads to inflammation and fibrosis in cardiorenal disease. We discuss the mechanisms of action of nonsteroidal MRAs and how they differ from steroidal MRAs. Nonsteroidal MRAs have demonstrated important differences in their distribution, binding mode to the MR and subsequent gene expression. For example, the novel nonsteroidal MRA finerenone has a balanced distribution between the heart and kidney compared with spironolactone, which is preferentially concentrated in the kidneys. Compared with eplerenone, equinatriuretic doses of finerenone show more potent anti-inflammatory and anti-fibrotic effects on the kidney in rodent models. Overall, nonsteroidal MRAs appear to demonstrate a better benefit-risk ratio than steroidal MRAs, where risk is measured as the propensity for hyperkalaemia. Among patients with Type 2 diabetes, several Phase II studies of finerenone show promising results, supporting benefits on the heart and kidneys. Furthermore, finerenone significantly reduced the combined primary endpoint (chronic kidney disease progression, kidney failure, or kidney death) vs. placebo when added to the standard of care in a large Phase III trial.

Finerenone (BAY 94-8862) is a selective, nonsteroidal mineralocorticoid receptor antagonist. The aim of this study was to assess the effect of mild or moderate hepatic impairment on the pharmacokinetics, safety and tolerability of finerenone. The study was conducted in a single-center, nonrandomized, noncontrolled, nonblinded observational design with group stratification. A single oral 5-mg dose of finerenone was administered as a tablet to participants with mild or moderate hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh A, score 5-6 [n = 9], or Child-Pugh B, score 7-9 [n = 9], respectively) and to age-, weight- and sex-matched healthy participants (n = 9). The pharmacokinetics of finerenone and its metabolites were assessed in plasma and urine, and safety and tolerability were monitored. Finerenone area under the plasma concentration-time curve (AUC) and unbound AUC were 38% and 55% greater, respectively, in participants with moderate hepatic impairment than in healthy participants, whereas maximum plasma concentration (C<sub>max</sub>) was unchanged. No clear effects on AUC or C<sub>max</sub> were seen in participants with mild hepatic impairment. Finerenone was safe and well tolerated in all participants. The effects of mild or moderate hepatic impairment on systemic exposure of finerenone are small, consistent with its low hepatic extraction and preponderance of gastrointestinal over hepatic first-pass clearance. Considering the small increases in AUC and the absence of changes in C<sub>max</sub>, a dose adaptation does not appear to be warranted in patients with mild or moderate hepatic impairment.

Mineralocorticoid receptor (MR) antagonists slow down the progression of heart failure after myocardial infarction (MI), but the cell-specific role of MR in these benefits is unclear. In this study, the role of MR expressed in vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMCs) was investigated. Two months after coronary artery ligation causing MI, mice with VSMC-specific MR deletion (MI-MR(SMKO)) and mice treated with the MR antagonist finerenone (MI-fine) had improved left ventricular compliance and elastance when compared with infarcted control mice (MI-CTL), as well as reduced interstitial fibrosis. Importantly, the coronary reserve assessed by magnetic resonance imaging was preserved (difference in myocardial perfusion before and after induction of vasodilatation, mL mg(-1) min(-1): MI-CTL: 1.1 ± 0.5, nonsignificant; MI-MR(SMKO): 4.6 ± 1.6 [P<0.05]; MI-fine: 3.6 ± 0.7 [P<0.01]). The endothelial function, tested on isolated septal coronary arteries by analyzing the acetylcholine-induced nitric oxide-dependent relaxation, was also improved by MR deletion in VSMCs or by finerenone treatment (relaxation %: MI-CTL: 36 ± 5, MI-MR(SMKO): 54 ± 3, and MI-fine: 76 ± 4; P<0.05). Such impairment of the coronary endothelial function on MI involved an oxidative stress that was reduced when MR was deleted in VSMCs or by finerenone treatment. Moreover, short-term incubation of coronary arteries isolated from noninfarcted animals with low-dose angiotensin-II (10(-9) mol/L) induced oxidative stress and impaired acetylcholine-induced relaxation in CTL but neither in MR(SMKO) nor in mice pretreated with finerenone. In conclusion, deletion of MR in VSMCs improved left ventricular dysfunction after MI, likely through maintenance of the coronary reserve and improvement of coronary endothelial function. MR blockage by finerenone had similar effects.

Mineralocorticoid receptor (MR) antagonists, for example, spironolactone and eplerenone, are in clinical use to treat hypertension. Increasing evidence suggests that mineralocorticoid receptor activation causes the pathogenesis and progression of chronic kidney disease. Aldosterone-induced MR activation increases inflammation, fibrosis, and oxidative stress in the kidney. MR antagonists (MRAs) have demonstrated therapeutic actions in chronic kidney disease (CKD), diabetic nephropathy (DN), renal fibrosis, and drug-induced renal injury in preclinical and clinical studies. We have summarized and discussed these studies in this review. The nonsteroidal MRA, esaxerenone, recently received approval for the treatment of hypertension. It has also shown a positive therapeutic effect in phase 3 clinical trials in patients with DN. Other nonsteroidal MRA such as apararenone, finerenone, AZD9977, and LY2623091 are in different clinical trials in patients with hypertension suffering from renal or hepatic fibrotic diseases. Hyperkalemia associated with MRA therapy has frequently led to the discontinuation of the treatment. The new generation nonsteroidal MRAs like esaxerenone are less likely to cause hyperkalemia at therapeutic doses. It appears that the nonsteroidal MRAs can provide optimum therapeutic benefit for patients suffering from kidney diseases.

Finerenone (BAY 94-8862) is a potent non-steroidal, selective mineralocorticoid receptor antagonist being developed for the treatment of patients with type 2 diabetes and chronic kidney disease. We present the population pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics (PD) analysis for efficacy and safety markers based on data from two clinical phase IIb studies: ARTS-DN (NCT01874431) and ARTS-DN Japan (NCT01968668). The pharmacokinetics of finerenone were adequately characterized, with estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) and body weight as influencing covariates. The area under the plasma concentration-time curve in Japanese patients did not differ from that in the global population, and the investigated pharmacokinetics were dose- and time-linear. In addition, the pharmacokinetic model provided robust individual exposure estimates to study exposure-response. The concentration-effect relationship over time for the efficacy marker urinary albumin:creatinine ratio (UACR) was well-characterized by a maximum effect model indicating saturation at high exposures. For the safety markers, a log-linear model and a power model were identified for serum potassium concentration and eGFR, respectively, indicating attenuation of effect gains at high exposures. There was no apparent ethnic effect on the investigated pharmacokinetic-pharmacodynamic relationships. The model-predicted times to reach the full (99%) steady-state drug effect on UACR, serum potassium, and eGFR were 138, 20, and 85 days, respectively, while the pharmacokinetic half-life was 2-3 h and steady state was achieved after 2 days, indicating timescale separation. Our dose-exposure-response modeling and simulation indicates effects were largely saturated at finerenone 20 mg and doses of both 10 and 20 mg once daily appear safe and efficacious at reducing albuminuria.

Treatment with angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEi) and angiotensin receptor blockers (ARB) is used to reduce proteinuria and retard the progression of chronic kidney disease (CKD). However, resolution of proteinuria may be incomplete with these therapies and the addition of an aldosterone antagonist may be added to further prevent progression of CKD. This is an update of a Cochrane review first published in 2009 and updated in 2014. To evaluate the effects of aldosterone antagonists (selective (eplerenone), non-selective (spironolactone or canrenone), or non-steroidal mineralocorticoid antagonists (finerenone)) in adults who have CKD with proteinuria (nephrotic and non-nephrotic range) on: patient-centred endpoints including kidney failure (previously know as end-stage kidney disease (ESKD)), major cardiovascular events, and death (any cause); kidney function (proteinuria, estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR), and doubling of serum creatinine); blood pressure; and adverse events (including hyperkalaemia, acute kidney injury, and gynaecomastia). We searched the Cochrane Kidney and Transplant Register of Studies up to 13 January 2020 through contact with the Information Specialist using search terms relevant to this review. Studies in the Register are identified through searches of CENTRAL, MEDLINE, and EMBASE, conference proceedings, the International Clinical Trials Register (ICTRP) Search Portal, and ClinicalTrials.gov. We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) and quasi-RCTs that compared aldosterone antagonists in combination with ACEi or ARB (or both) to other anti-hypertensive strategies or placebo in participants with proteinuric CKD. Two authors independently assessed study quality and extracted data. Data were summarised using random effects meta-analysis. We expressed summary treatment estimates as a risk ratio (RR) for dichotomous outcomes and mean difference (MD) for continuous outcomes, or standardised mean difference (SMD) when different scales were used together with their 95% confidence interval (CI). Risk of bias were assessed using the Cochrane tool. Evidence certainty was evaluated using GRADE. Forty-four studies (5745 participants) were included. Risk of bias in the evaluated methodological domains were unclear or high risk in most studies. Adequate random sequence generation was present in 12 studies, allocation concealment in five studies, blinding of participant and investigators in 18 studies, blinding of outcome assessment in 15 studies, and complete outcome reporting in 24 studies. All studies comparing aldosterone antagonists to placebo or standard care were used in addition to an ACEi or ARB (or both). None of the studies were powered to detect differences in patient-level outcomes including kidney failure, major cardiovascular events or death. Aldosterone antagonists had uncertain effects on kidney failure (2 studies, 84 participants: RR 3.00, 95% CI 0.33 to 27.65, I² = 0%; very low certainty evidence), death (3 studies, 421 participants: RR 0.58, 95% CI 0.10 to 3.50, I² = 0%; low certainty evidence), and cardiovascular events (3 studies, 1067 participants: RR 0.95, 95% CI 0.26 to 3.56; I² = 42%; low certainty evidence) compared to placebo or standard care. Aldosterone antagonists may reduce protein excretion (14 studies, 1193 participants: SMD -0.51, 95% CI -0.82 to -0.20, I² = 82%; very low certainty evidence), eGFR (13 studies, 1165 participants, MD -3.00 mL/min/1.73 m², 95% CI -5.51 to -0.49, I² = 0%, low certainty evidence) and systolic blood pressure (14 studies, 911 participants: MD -4.98 mmHg, 95% CI -8.22 to -1.75, I² = 87%; very low certainty evidence) compared to placebo or standard care. Aldosterone antagonists probably increase the risk of hyperkalaemia (17 studies, 3001 participants: RR 2.17, 95% CI 1.47 to 3.22, I² = 0%; moderate certainty evidence), acute kidney injury (5 studies, 1446 participants: RR 2.04, 95% CI 1.05 to 3.97, I² = 0%; moderate certainty evidence), and gynaecomastia (4 studies, 281 participants: RR 5.14, 95% CI 1.14 to 23.23, I² = 0%; moderate certainty evidence) compared to placebo or standard care. Non-selective aldosterone antagonists plus ACEi or ARB had uncertain effects on protein excretion (2 studies, 139 participants: SMD -1.59, 95% CI -3.80 to 0.62, I² = 93%; very low certainty evidence) but may increase serum potassium (2 studies, 121 participants: MD 0.31 mEq/L, 95% CI 0.17 to 0.45, I² = 0%; low certainty evidence) compared to diuretics plus ACEi or ARB. Selective aldosterone antagonists may increase the risk of hyperkalaemia (2 studies, 500 participants: RR 1.62, 95% CI 0.66 to 3.95, I² = 0%; low certainty evidence) compared ACEi or ARB (or both). There were insufficient studies to perform meta-analyses for the comparison between non-selective aldosterone antagonists and calcium channel blockers, selective aldosterone antagonists plus ACEi or ARB (or both) and nitrate plus ACEi or ARB (or both), and non-steroidal mineralocorticoid antagonists and selective aldosterone antagonists. The effects of aldosterone antagonists when added to ACEi or ARB (or both) on the risks of death, major cardiovascular events, and kidney failure in people with proteinuric CKD are uncertain. Aldosterone antagonists may reduce proteinuria, eGFR, and systolic blood pressure in adults who have mild to moderate CKD but may increase the risk of hyperkalaemia, acute kidney injury and gynaecomastia when added to ACEi and/or ARB.

Mineralocorticoid receptor (MR) overactivation promotes cardiac fibrosis. We studied the ability of the non-steroidal MR antagonist finerenone to prevent fibrotic remodeling. In neonatal rat cardiac fibroblasts, finerenone prevented aldosterone-induced nuclear MR translocation. Treatment with finerenone decreased the expression of connective tissue growth factor (CTGF) (74 ± 15% of control, p = 0.005) and prevented aldosterone-induced upregulation of CTGF and lysyl oxidase (LOX) completely. Finerenone attenuated the upregulation of transforming growth factor ß (TGF-ß), which was induced by the Rac1 GTPase activator l-buthionine sulfoximine. Transgenic mice with cardiac-specific overexpression of Rac1 (RacET) showed increased left ventricular (LV) end-diastolic (63.7 ± 8.0 vs. 93.8 ± 25.6 µl, p = 0.027) and end-systolic (28.0 ± 4.0 vs. 49.5 ± 16.7 µl, p = 0.014) volumes compared to wild-type FVBN control mice. Treatment of RacET mice with 100 ppm finerenone over 5 months prevented LV dilatation. Systolic and diastolic LV function did not differ between the three groups. RacET mice exhibited overactivation of MR and 11ß hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase type 2. Both effects were reduced by finerenone (reduction about 36%, p = 0.030, and 40%, p = 0.032, respectively). RacET mice demonstrated overexpression of TGF-ß, CTGF, LOX, osteopontin as well as collagen and myocardial fibrosis in the left ventricle. In contrast, expression of these parameters did not differ between finerenone-treated RacET and control mice. Finerenone prevented left atrial dilatation (6.4 ± 1.5 vs. 4.7 ± 1.4 mg, p = 0.004) and left atrial fibrosis (17.8 ± 3.1 vs. 12.8 ± 3.1%, p = 0.046) compared to vehicle-treated RacET mice. In summary, finerenone prevented from MR-mediated structural remodeling in cardiac fibroblasts and in RacET mice. These data demonstrate anti-fibrotic myocardial effects of finerenone.

Pharmacological blockade of the mineralocorticoid receptor (MR) ameliorates end-organ damage in chronic heart failure. However, the clinical use of available steroidal MR antagonists is restricted because of concomitant hyperkalemia especially in patients with diminished kidney function. We have recently identified a novel nonsteroidal MR antagonist, finerenone, which uniquely combines potency and selectivity toward MR. Here, we investigated the tissue distribution and chronic cardiorenal end-organ protection of finerenone in comparison to the steroidal MR antagonist, eplerenone, in 2 different preclinical rat disease models. Quantitative whole-body autoradiography revealed that [C]-labeled finerenone equally distributes into rat cardiac and renal tissues. Finerenone treatment prevented deoxycorticosterone acetate-/salt-challenged rats from functional as well as structural heart and kidney damage at dosages not reducing systemic blood pressure. Finerenone reduced cardiac hypertrophy, plasma prohormone of brain natriuretic peptide, and proteinuria more efficiently than eplerenone when comparing equinatriuretic doses. In rats that developed chronic heart failure after coronary artery ligation, finerenone (1 mg·kg·d), but not eplerenone (100 mg·kg·d) improved systolic and diastolic left ventricular function and reduced plasma prohormone of brain natriuretic peptide levels. We conclude that finerenone may offer end-organ protection with a reduced risk of electrolyte disturbances.

To investigate the safety and potential efficacy of the novel non-steroidal mineralocorticoid receptor antagonist finerenone in patients with worsening chronic heart failure and reduced left ventricular ejection fraction (HFrEF) and at high risk of hyperkalaemia and worsening renal dysfunction. The MinerAlocorticoid Receptor antagonist Tolerability Study-Heart Failure (ARTS-HF; NCT01807221) is a multicentre, randomized, double-blind, active-comparator-controlled, six-parallel-group, phase 2b dose-finding study. In total, 1060 patients with HFrEF and concomitant type 2 diabetes mellitus and/or chronic kidney disease (CKD) will be randomized within 7 days of emergency presentation to hospital for worsening chronic HF to receive finerenone (one of five doses in the range 2.5-20.0 mg once daily) or eplerenone (25 mg every second day to 50 mg once daily for 90 days). The primary objective is to investigate the safety and potential efficacy (measured as the percentage of individuals with a decrease in plasma N-terminal pro-B-type natriuretic peptide [NT-proBNP] of more than 30% relative to baseline at day 90 ± 2) of different oral doses of finerenone compared with eplerenone. Other objectives are to assess the effects of finerenone on a composite clinical endpoint (death from any cause, cardiovascular hospitalizations, or emergency presentations for worsening chronic HF), and on changes in health-related quality of life from baseline. ARTS-HF is the first phase 2b clinical trial to investigate the effects of finerenone on plasma NT-proBNP in a high-risk population of patients who have worsening chronic HF with type 2 diabetes mellitus and/or CKD presenting at the emergency department.

Finerenone is a novel selective nonsteroidal mineralocorticoid receptor antagonist. Results in preclinical studies showed that lower doses of finerenone were needed to achieve similar cardiorenal protective effects compared to both spironolactone and eplerenone and phase II studies in finerenone in patients with heart failure, type-2 diabetes mellitus and/or chronic kidney disease are encouraging as the drug is effective and safe in patients on renin-angiotensin system inhibitors (significant reduction in albuminuria and a low rate of hyperkalemia), but the primary end points were "soft" end points (serum potassium, estimated glomerular filtration rate, albuminuria, N-terminal prohormone B-type natriuretic peptide levels). Thus, further, large-scale, long-term phase III trials are needed to confirm whether the greater affinity and selectivity is translated into improved clinical outcomes.

The mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists (MRAs) spironolactone and eplerenone reduce the risk of hospitalizations and mortality in patients with heart failure (HF) with reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF), and attenuate progression of diabetic kidney disease. However, their use is limited by the fear of inducing hyperkalemia, especially in patients with renal dysfunction. Finerenone is a novel nonsteroidal MRA, with higher selectivity toward the mineralocorticoid receptor (MR) compared to spironolactone and stronger MR-binding affinity than eplerenone. This paper discusses the chemistry, pharmacokinetics, clinical efficacy and safety of finerenone. The selectivity and greater binding affinity of finerenone to the MR may reduce the risk of hyperkalemia and renal dysfunction and thereby overcome the reluctance to start and uptitrate MRAs in patients with HF and diabetic kidney disease. Studies conducted in patients with HFrEF and moderate chronic kidney disease and diabetic kidney disease, showed promising results. Phase III trials will have to show whether finerenone might become the third-generation MRA for the treatment of HF and diabetic kidney disease.

Finerenone (BAY 94-8862) is a nonsteroidal mineralocorticoid receptor antagonist in development for the treatment of diabetic kidney disease. This observational trial compared the pharmacokinetics of a single oral dose of finerenone 10 mg (immediate-release tablet) in adults with mild (creatinine clearance [CL<sub>CR</sub> ] 50-80 mL/min; n = 8), moderate (CL<sub>CR</sub> 30 to < 50 mL/min; n = 8), or severe (CL<sub>CR</sub> < 30 mL/min; n  =  9) renal impairment with those in adults with normal renal function (CL<sub>CR</sub> > 80 mL/min; n  = 8) over 96 hours postdose. Exposure to finerenone was not affected by mild renal impairment. In participants with moderate or severe renal impairment, exposure to finerenone was increased compared with those with normal renal function (increase in area under the curve for unbound finerenone, 57.1% [outlier excluded] and 46.5%, respectively), with moderate to high interindividual variability. Renal impairment had no consistent effect on the maximum plasma concentration, C<sub>max</sub> (differences in C<sub>max</sub> for unbound finerenone of +12% and -7% with moderate [outlier excluded] and severe impairment vs normal renal function, respectively). Renal elimination of finerenone is minimal. However, changes in exposure may occur because of the effects of renal impairment on nonrenal routes of elimination.

(-)-Finerenone is a nonsteroidal mineralocorticoid receptor antagonist currently in phase III clinical trials for the treatment of chronic kidney disease in type 2 diabetes. It contains an unusual dihydronaphthyridine core. We report a 6-step synthesis of (-)-finerenone, which features an enantioselective partial transfer hydrogenation of a naphthyridine using a chiral phosphoric acid catalyst with a Hantzsch ester. The process is complicated by the fact that the naphthyridine exists as a mixture of two atropisomers that react at different rates and with different selectivities. The intrinsic kinetic resolution was converted into a kinetic dynamic resolution at elevated temperature, which enabled us to obtain (-)-finerenone in both high yield and high enantioselectivity. DFT calculations have revealed the origin of selectivity.

Mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists (MRAs) are recommended for the treatment of heart failure and hypertension, mainly due to their natriuretic and anti-fibrotic mode of action. Rodent studies have shown that MRAs can prevent adverse metabolic consequences of obesity but an elucidation of underlying molecular mechanisms is missing. Here, we investigated metabolic effects of the novel non-steroidal MRA finerenone (FIN) in a mouse model of high-fat diet (HFD)-induced obesity and the signaling pathways activated by MR antagonism at level of interscapular brown adipose tissue (iBAT). C57BL/6J male mice were fed a normal diet or a HFD (with60% kcal from fat) containing or not FIN for 3 months. Metabolic parameters, adipose tissue morphology, gene and protein expression analysis were assessed. We also used brown adipocyte cultures (T37i cells) to investigate the effects of FIN-mediated MR antagonism upon lipid and mitochondrial metabolism. HFD + FIN-treated mice showed improved glucose tolerance together with increased multilocularity and higher expression of thermogenic markers at the level of iBAT, without differences in white adipose depots, suggesting an iBAT-specific effect of FIN. Mechanistically, FIN increased activation of AMP-activated protein kinase which, in turn, stimulated adipose triglyceride lipase activation, with subsequent increased expression of uncoupling protein-1 in brown adipocytes.

Among diabetics, those with kidney disease have exceptionally high rates of cardiovascular (CV) morbidity and mortality, and progression of their underlying disease. Finerenone is a novel, non-steroidal, selective mineralocorticoid-receptor antagonist which has shown to reduce albuminuria in type 2 diabetes (T2D) patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD), while revealing only a low risk of hyperkalemia. However, the effect of finerenone on renal and CV outcomes has not been investigated in long-term trials yet. The Finerenone in Reducing Kidney Failure and Disease Progression in Diabetic Kidney Disease -(FIDELIO-DKD) trial aims to assess the efficacy and safety of finerenone compared to placebo at reducing clinically important renal and CV outcomes in T2D patients with CKD. FIDELIO-DKD is a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel-group, event-driven trial running in 47 countries with an expected duration of approximately 5.5 years. FIDELIO-DKD randomized 5,734 patients with an estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) ≥25-<75 mL/min/1.73 m2 and albuminuria (urinary albumin-to-creatinine ratio ≥30-≤5,000 mg/g). The study has at least 90% power to detect a 20% reduction in the risk of primary outcome (overall two-sided significance level α = 0.05), the composite of time to first occurrence of kidney failure, a sustained decrease of eGFR ≥40% from baseline over at least 4 weeks, or renal death. FIDELIO-DKD will determine whether an optimally treated cohort of T2D patients with CKD at high risk of renal and CV events will experience cardiorenal benefits with the addition of finerenone to their treatment regimen.
