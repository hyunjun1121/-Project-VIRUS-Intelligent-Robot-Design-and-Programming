We investigated the involvement of the recently described staphylococcal enterotoxins G and I in toxic shock syndrome. We reexamined Staphylococcus aureus strains isolated from patients with menstrual and nonmenstrual toxic shock syndrome (nine cases) or staphylococcal scarlet fever (three cases). These strains were selected because they produced none of the toxins known to be involved in these syndromes (toxic shock syndrome toxin 1 and enterotoxins A, B, C, and D), enterotoxin E or H, or exfoliative toxin A or B, despite the fact that superantigenic toxins were detected in a CD69-specific flow cytometry assay measuring T-cell activation. Sets of primers specific to the enterotoxin G and I genes (seg and sei, respectively) were designed and used for PCR amplification. All of the strains were positive for seg and sei. Sequence analysis confirmed that the PCR products, corresponded to the target genes. We suggest that staphylococcal enterotoxins G and I may be capable of causing human staphylococcal toxic shock syndrome and staphylococcal scarlet fever.

1. Hemolytic streptococcus has been found in 100 per cent of the throats of patients with scarlet fever during the 1st week of the disease. 2. The average length of time that these organisms are present in the throat varies from 10 to 20 days. 3. No morphological or cultural characteristics peculiar to the hemolytic streptococcus from scarlet fever can be demonstrated. 4. Ten immune sera have been prepared from different strains of scarlet fever streptococci and each of the sera agglutinated more than 80 per cent of the strains isolated from scarlatinal throats. On the other hand, scarlatinal streptococci are not agglutinated by immune sera prepared from hemolytic streptococci isolated from other pathological sources. 5. Serum from patients convalescent from scarlet fever agglutinates weakly or not at all the homologous strain of hemolytic streptococcus. 6. The specificity of the agglutination reaction of scarlatinal streptococci is confirmed by absorption experiments. 7. Scarlatinal antistreptococcic serum affords some degree of protection against virulent scarlet fever streptococci but has no protective power against hemolytic streptococci from other diseases. 8. In a small epidemic of scarlet fever a healthy carrier of hemolytic streptococcus was detected; the organism carried was identical in its serological reactions with strains of hemolytic streptococci isolated from active cases of scarlet fever. 9. In a study of a number of contacts with a case of scarlet fever, in only one instance was a scarlatinal type of hemolytic streptococcus recovered from the throat.

There was a dramatic increase in scarlet fever cases in China from March to July 2011. Group A Streptococcus (GAS) is the only pathogen known to cause scarlet fever. Matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF MS) coupled to Biotyper system was used for GAS identification in 2011. A local reference database (LRD) was constructed, evaluated and used to identify GAS isolates. The 75 GAS strains used to evaluate the LRD were all identified correctly. Of the 157 suspected β-hemolytic strains isolated from 298 throat swab samples, 127 (100%) and 120 (94.5%) of the isolates were identified as GAS by the MALDI-TOF MS system and the conventional bacitracin sensitivity test method, respectively. All 202 (100%) isolates were identified at the species level by searching the LRD, while 182 (90.1%) were identified by searching the original reference database (ORD). There were statistically significant differences with a high degree of credibility at species level (χ(2)=6.052, P<0.05 between the LRD and ORD). The test turnaround time was shortened 36-48h, and the cost of each sample is one-tenth of the cost of conventional methods. Establishing a domestic database is the most effective way to improve the identification efficiency using a MALDI-TOF MS system. MALDI-TOF MS is a viable alternative to conventional methods and may aid in the diagnosis and surveillance of GAS.

A series of observations on the blood of patients acutely ill with scarlet fever has shown that a toxic substance can be demonstrated in the serum by means of intracutaneous injections of the serum in persons who have not had scarlet fever and whose serums fail to blanch the rash in scarlet fever. The reaction caused by this substance consists of a bright red local erythema, varying from 20 to 70 mm. in diameter, of 1 to 4 days duration. The severer reactions are moderately indurated and tender, and are followed bypigmentation and desquamation. Control injections in persons whose serums blanch the rash in scarlet fever cause no reaction. The toxic substance is not neutralized by mixture with a human serum which gives a negative blanching test but is readily neutralized by a human serum which gives a positive blanching test. It is not neutralized by normal horse serum, but is completely neutralized by Dochez's scarlatinal antistreptococcic serum. In a limited number of observations on the urine of patients with scarlet fever a similar toxic substance has been found in two out of five cases studied. Since the toxic substance described appears to resemble the toxic substance found in the filtrates of scarlatinal hemolytic streptococcus cultures by Dick and Dick and since it is neutralized not only by a blanching human serum but also by Dochez's scarlatinal antistreptococcic horse serum, the experiments reported support the conception that scarlet fever is a local infection of the throat by a particular type of Streptococcus haemolyticus capable of producing a toxin which is absorbed and is the cause of the general manifestations of the disease.

Erythrogenic toxin type A (ETA) is assumed to play a causative role in both scarlet fever and the streptococcal toxic shock-like syndrome (TSLS). For a molecular epidemiological analysis of the gene of erythrogenic toxin type A (speA) we used altogether 497 clinical isolates of Streptococcus pyogenes belonging to three groups: a) isolates from patients with scarlet fever, b) isolates from cases with TSLS, c) isolates from patients with other streptococcal infections (like otitis media, tonsillitis, impetigo) (general group). We found that less than 50% of the scarlet fever-associated strains possessed the speA gene as compared to 25% of the general group. Only 5 to 30% of these strains secreted the toxin under experimental conditions in very low quantities. Among strains isolated from TSLS, 67% appeared to contain the speA gene. The amount of ETA secreted into the medium was also extremely low. Southern hybridization patterns proved to be the same with an speA-specific probe in all three groups of streptococcal isolates (HaeIII, HindIII). Increased occurrence of the speA gene among scarlet fever and TSLS-associated strains does not seem to be sufficient to support the hypothesis that ETA may have a causative role in both diseases since a considerable number of strains in these groups did not possess the speA gene.

Streptococcus pyogenes (group A Streptococcus - GAS) is an important human pathogen which causes a variety of diseases, including tonsillopharyngitis, scarlet fever and rheumatic fever. It is important to understand the changes in epidemiology of the diseases caused by the pathogen for improved control of such infections. Hence, the aim of the present study was to carry out an epidemiological analysis of GAS infections in Serbia in a 9-yr period (1991-1999) and evaluation of susceptibility of GAS isolates obtained during the same period to penicillin and erythromycin. Occurrence of tonsillopharyngitis, scarlatina and rheumatic fever was analyzed and GAS carrier status in healthy children was examined over a 9-yr period from 1991 to 1999. Susceptibility to penicillin and erythromycin was determined for 1657 GAS isolates obtained from patients diagnosed with pharyngitis or scarlet fever and 512 isolates from healthy carriers. M-type antigen was also determined in these isolates. The average incidences of tonsillopharyngitis and scarlet fever were 76.2 and 30.8 per cent respectively. A total of 166 cases of rheumatic fever were registered. Per cent of carriers varied from 5.5 to 11.4 per cent over the study period. Predominating M serotypes among GAS isolates tested were M1, M3, M4, M6, M11, M12 and M18, depending on the source of clinical material and period of isolation. Antimicrobial susceptibility testing showed susceptibility to penicillin in all isolates tested and resistance to erythromycin in 2.41 per cent of the isolates. Although the fluctuations in incidence were noted during the nine-year period, the incidence of streptococcal tonsillopharyngitis is low but with a steady raise in Serbia. No significant changes in the incidence of scarlet fever and rheumatic fever were noted. Susceptibility to penicillin remained unchanged, but the number or erythromycin resistant strains have increased.

To understand the distribution of emm gene types related to group A streptococcus-caused scarlet fever among children in Beijing and to analyze the relationship between the mutation of the emm types and scarlet fever. Nasopharyngeal swab samples were collected from the scarlet fever cases diagnosed in 36 hospitals in Beijing to isolate the GAS strains from May to July, betgween 2011 and 2014. Genotyping of emm gene was performed with PCR and N-terminal gene fragments of M protein were sequenced. Data of all the scarlet fever cases in Beijing that reported through the National Notifiable Infectious Disease Surveillance System (NNIDSS) , were gathered and analyzed. Among the collected 2 161 nasopharyngeal swabs, 762 GAS strains were identified (35.3%). In addition, 7 emm types were detected, in which emm12 accounted for 69.4% (529/762) , emm1 accounted for 29.8% (227/762) , and other five types (emm 11, 22, 75, 89, and 128) accounted for 0.8% (6/762) , respctively. Compared with the emm types detected between 2011 and 2014, emm12, emm1 and other types accounted for 82.2% (295/359) , 16.7% (60/359) and 1.1% (4/359, including emm11, 22 and 89) in 2011 respectively.emm12, emm1 and emm75 accounted for 77.3% (123/163) , 23.9% (39/163) and 0.6% (1/163) respectively in 2012. emm12 and emm1 accounted for 50.7% (38/75) and 49.3% (37/75) in 2013 while emm12, emm1 and emm128 accounted for 44.2% (73/165) , 55.2% (91/165) and 0.6% (1/165) respectively in 2014. The differences of the constitution of emm types from 2011 to 2014 appeared statistically significant (P<0.001). In 2011 and 2012, major type appeared as emm12, but in 2014, emm1 became predominant. A total of 6 152 cases were reported in 2011, while 2 908, 2 048 and 3 918 cases were reported in 2012, 2013 and 2014 respectively. Age specific differences were noticed in the distribution of emm types GAS strains in 2011, with the number of emm12 strains detected higher in 1-5 year olds than in age group > 5 years (P<0.05). There were area specific differences in distribution of emm types of GAS strains seen in 2011 and 2013. In 2011, the number of emm1 strains detected in urban area was higher than in suburb area (P<0.05). However, in 2013, the number of emm1 strains detected in suburb area was seen higher than in urban area (P< 0.05). GAS with emm12 and GAS emm1 appeared interchangeably predominant in Beijing from 2011 to 2014. Changes in predominant emm types seemed also related to the trends of incidence rates on scarlet fever.

After a young woman had scarlet fever associated with group C beta-hemolytic streptococcal pharyngitis, we reviewed all cases of pharyngitis treated at a student health clinic during that semester. From 541 cases of pharyngitis, 34 cultures yielded group C Streptococcus. The patients who harbored group C organisms were similar to the patients with group A streptococcal pharyngitis in the presence of fever, exudate, and cervical adenopathy. The severity of symptoms and the demonstration of scarlet fever developing from infection with this organism supports antibiotic treatment of patients with group C streptococcal pharyngitis.

In this study, 830 Streptococcus pyogenes isolates collected between 2001 and 2002 from patients with scarlet fever in northern Taiwan were analyzed by M protein gene (emm) sequence typing, pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE), and antimicrobial susceptibility testing. A total of 21 emm types and 56 PFGE patterns were identified. The most frequent emm types were emm1 (29.2%), emm4 (24.1%), emm12 (19.0%), emm6 (15.8%), stIL103 (5.7%), and emm22 (1.9%). Antimicrobial resistance profiles were determined, and resistance to erythromycin (24.6%), clindamycin (2.0%), and chloramphenicol (1.3%) was detected. Five major emm types (emm4, emm12, emm1, emm22, and emm6) accounted for 95.6% of the erythromycin-resistant isolates. The decreased prevalence of erythromycin-resistant emm12 strains coincided with the overall decrease in erythromycin resistance from 32.1% in 2001 to 21.1% in 2002 in Taiwan. Five major clones (emm4/2000, emm12/0000, emm4/2010, emm1/1000, and emm22/8100) represented 72.1% of the erythromycin-resistant isolates. The survey of group A Streptococcus emm types, genetic diversity, and antibiotic resistance has direct relevance to current antimicrobial use policies and potential vaccine development strategies.

Several outbreaks of scarlet fever caused by Streptococcus pyogenes were recently reported. Scarlet fever is historically considered a toxin-mediated disease, dependent on the production of the exotoxins SpeA and SpeC, but a strict association between scarlet fever and these exotoxins is not always detected. The aims of this study were to characterize the scarlet fever bacterial isolates recovered from patients in a Lisbon hospital and to identify any distinctive characteristics of such isolates. We characterized a collection of 303 pharyngeal S. pyogenes collected between 2002 and 2008. One-hundred and one were isolated from scarlet fever patients and 202 were associated to a diagnosis of tonsillo-pharyngitis. Isolates were characterized by T and emm typing, pulsed field gel electrophoresis profiling and superantigen gene profiling. The diversity of the scarlet fever isolates was lower than that of the pharyngitis isolates. Specific lineages of emm87, emm4 and emm3 were overrepresented in scarlet fever isolates but only 1 pulsed field gel electrophoresis major lineage was significantly associated with scarlet fever. Multivariate analysis indicated associations of ssa, speA and speC with scarlet fever. In nonoutbreak conditions, scarlet fever is caused by a number of distinct genetic lineages. The lower diversity of these isolates and the association with specific exotoxin genes indicates that some lineages are more prone to cause this presentation than others even in nonoutbreak conditions.

Scarlet fever is one of a variety of diseases caused by group A Streptococcus (GAS). During 2011, a scarlet fever epidemic characterized by peak monthly incidence rates 2.9-6.7 times higher than those in 2006-2010 occurred in Beijing, China. During the epidemic, hospital-based enhanced surveillance for scarlet fever and pharyngitis was conducted to determine characteristics of circulating GAS strains. The surveillance identified 3,359 clinical cases of scarlet fever or pharyngitis. GAS was isolated from 647 of the patients; 76.4% of the strains were type emm12, and 17.1% were emm1. Almost all isolates harbored superantigens speC and ssa. All isolates were susceptible to penicillin, and resistance rates were 96.1% to erythromycin, 93.7% to tetracycline, and 79.4% to clindamycin. Because emm12 type GAS is not the predominant type in other countries, wider surveillance for the possible spread of emm12 type GAS from China to other countries is warranted.

Little information is available on the differences in frequency of pyrogenic exotoxin genes between strains of group A streptococci that cause scarlet fever and those that cause pharyngotonsillitis in children in Taiwan. This study retrospectively monitored the presence of pyrogenic exotoxin genes, the emm typing, and the susceptibility of macrolide drugs in Streptococcus pyogenes isolated from children diagnosed with scarlet fever and pharyngotonsillitis in northern Taiwan. Isolates of S. pyogenes were recovered from children with scarlet fever (n = 21) and acute pharyngotonsillitis (n = 29) during 2000-2011. The isolates were characterized according to the presence of spe genes and emm typing. Antibiograms were determined by the disk diffusion method and agar dilution test. Polymerase chain reaction was used to detect the presence of erm genes in isolates that showed nonsusceptibility to erythromycin. All isolates underwent additional genotyping by pulsed-field gel electrophoresis. In isolates from patients with scarlet fever, the frequencies of pyrogenic exotoxin genes were 9.5% for speA, 81.0% for speB, 4.8% for speC, and 71.4% for speF. In isolates from patients with pharyngotonsillitis, the frequencies were 17.2% for speA, 72.4% for speB, 13.8% for speC, and 69.0% for speF. There were no significant differences in frequencies of the exotoxin genes between the two groups of isolates. Eight emm sequence types were identified from all group A streptococci isolates. The most common types were emm12 followed by emm1 and emm4. The erythromycin resistant rate was 4/50 (8%). The ermB gene was detected in only one isolate from a patient with pharyngotonsillitis. Pulsed-field gel electrophoresis had a total of three sets of clustered strains, which showed >80% homology and belonged to the same emm type. There were no significant differences in frequencies of the spe genes between S. pyogenes isolates from patients with scarlet fever and patients with pharyngotonsillitis. The most common emm type was emm12. Low erythromycin resistance in S. pyogenes was observed.

In an effort to understand the molecular genetic basis of temporal variation in frequency and severity of bacterial disease, genetic relationships among strains of Streptococcus pyogenes that caused scarlet fever epidemics in Canada in the early 1940s and in eastern Germany in the 1960s to 1980s were studied. Application of multilocus enzyme electrophoresis and comparative sequencing of the gene (speA) encoding streptococcal pyrogenic exotoxin A (scarlet fever toxin) revealed that new waves of scarlet fever are associated with an increase in frequency of S. pyogenes clones carrying variant speA alleles. This finding suggests that the occurrence of new scarlet fever epidemics can be predicted by comprehensive monitoring of the frequency of S. pyogenes clones with variant toxin alleles.

The grampositive bacterium S. pyogenes (beta-haemolytic group A Streptococcus) is a natural colonizer of the human oropharynx mucous membrane and one of the most common agents of infectious diseases in humans. S. pyogenes causes the widest range of disease in humans among all bacterial pathogens. It is responsible for various skin infections such as impetigo contagiosa and erysipelas, and localized mucous membrane infections of the oropharynx (e. g. tonsillitis and pharyngitis). Betahaemolytic group A Streptococcus causes also invasive diseases such as sepses including puerperal sepsis. Additionally, S. pyogenes induces toxin-mediated syndromes, i. e. scarlet fever, streptococcal toxic shock syndrome (STSS) and necrotizing fasciitis (NF). STSS and NF are severe, frequently fatal diseases that have emerged in Europe and Northern America during the last two decades. Finally, some immunpathological diseases such as acute rheumatic fever and glomerulonephritis also result from S. pyogenes infections. Most scientists recommend penicillins (benzylpenicillin, phenoxymethylpenicllin) as drugs of first choice for treatment of Streptococcus tonsillopharyngitis and scarlet fever. Erysipelas and some other skin infections should be treated with benzylpenicillin. Intensive care measurements are needed for treatment of severe toxin-mediated S. pyogenes diseases. These measurements include the elimination of internal bacterial foci, concomitant application of clindamycin and benzylpenicillin and suitable treatment of shock symptoms. Management of immunpathological diseases requires antiphlogistical therapy. Because of the wide distribution of S. pyogenes in the general population and the lack of an effective vaccine, possibilities for prevention allowing a suitable protection for diseases due to S. pyogenes are very limited.

Arcanobacterium hemolyticum infections are a common cause of pharyngitis and rash in the 10- to 30-year-old age group. Despite its prevalence, many emergency and primary care physicians may not be aware of the pathogenic potential of this organism. We present a case that illustrates the distinctive clinical spectrum of A. hemolyticum infections that may be confused with drug allergy, group A streptococcal scarlet fever, diphtheria, and even toxic shock syndrome. Recognition of this syndrome will reduce misdiagnoses and facilitate appropriate treatment.

Infection with group A beta-hemolytic streptococci (GABHS) is the most common bacterial cause of acute pharyngitis and tonsillitis beyond infancy. We report on two patients with scarlet fever associated with hepatitis. The patients (boys aged 6 and 7 years) both presented with a scarlatiniform rash, dark urine and light-colored stools. Laboratory studies revealed elevated liver transaminases and negative antibody tests against hepatitis viruses A, B and C, cytomegalovirus and Epstein-Barr virus. Both patients were treated with antibiotics and recovered completely within a few days. Although the association between scarlet fever and hepatitis has been known for many decades, the pathogenesis is still unknown. Physicians treating patients with group A beta-hemolytic streptococcal infections should be aware of possible hepatic involvement.

The incidence rate for scarlet fever in South Korea is rising. During 2008-2015, we collected group A Streptococcus isolates and performed emm and exotoxin genotyping and disk-diffusion antimicrobial tests. Scarlet fever in South Korea was most closely associated with emm types emm4, emm28, emm1, and emm3. In 2015, tetracycline resistance started increasing.

The appearance of the "streptococcal toxic shock-like syndrome" led to a growing interest in infections caused by Streptococcus pyogenes (group-A-streptococci). Since 1987 some 800 cases with a lethality of 20% or more were observed. Contrary to toxic scarlet fever the site of primary infection are the lower respiratory tract or soft tissue infections. Erythrogenic toxins and low molecular weight mitogens, inducing cytokines (IL-2, IL-3, IL-6, TNF-alpha, IFN-gamma) seem to be involved in the pathogenesis of these severe infections. Morphologically and culturally the strains isolated from cases of toxic shock-like syndrome cannot be differentiated from isolates of epidemic scarlet fever or sporadic cases. At the same time, when in Scandinavia an epidemic by S.pyogenes type 1 with many cases of toxic shock was observed, the same type caused a scarlet fever epidemic without complications in eastern Germany. Erythrogenic toxin type A or its toxoid, respectively, can be used for successful immunizations of rabbits. Another--antibacterial-immunization can be done with the M-protein of S.pyogenes, which is limited by its type-specificity. Streptococcal vaccination is required especially for developing countries with a high incidence of rheumatic fever. Infections due to Streptococcus agalactiae (group-B streptococci) are often underestimated though they have a first position in septicemia and meningitis of newborns. Taxonomy and nomenclature of streptococci are often changing; a list of the presently known species is presented in table I.
