Which syndrome is caused by dysfunction of the ciliary ARMC9/TOGARAM1 protein?

Joubert syndrome (JBTS) is a recessive neurodevelopmental ciliopathy characterized by a pathognomonic hindbrain malformation. All known JBTS genes encode proteins involved in the structure or function of primary cilia, ubiquitous antenna-like organelles essential for cellular signal transduction. Here, we used the recently identified JBTS-associated protein armadillo repeat motif-containing 9 (ARMC9) in tandem-affinity purification and yeast 2-hybrid screens to identify a ciliary module whose dysfunction underlies JBTS. In addition to the known JBTS-associated proteins CEP104 and CSPP1, we identified coiled-coil domain containing 66 (CCDC66) and TOG array regulator of axonemal microtubules 1 (TOGARAM1) as ARMC9 interaction partners. We found that TOGARAM1 variants cause JBTS and disrupt TOGARAM1 interaction with ARMC9. Using a combination of protein interaction analyses, characterization of patient-derived fibroblasts, and analysis of CRISPR/Cas9-engineered zebrafish and hTERT-RPE1 cells, we demonstrated that dysfunction of ARMC9 or TOGARAM1 resulted in short cilia with decreased axonemal acetylation and polyglutamylation, but relatively intact transition zone function. Aberrant serum-induced ciliary resorption and cold-induced depolymerization in ARMC9 and TOGARAM1 patient cell lines suggest a role for this new JBTS-associated protein module in ciliary stability.

Intellectual disability (ID) refers to deficits in mental abilities, social behavior, and motor skills to perform activities of daily living as compared to peers. Numerous genetic and environmental factors may be responsible for ID. We report on elucidation of molecular basis for syndromic ID associated with ptosis, polydactyly, and MRI features suggestive of Joubert syndrome using homozygosity mapping followed by exome sequencing. The analysis revealed a novel synonymous variation p.T293T (c.879G>A) which leads to a splicing defect in ARMC9 gene. The variant is present in conserved region of ARM domain of ARMC9 protein, which is predicted to form a platform for protein interaction. This domain is likely to be altered in patient due to splicing defect caused by this synonymous variation. Our report of variant in ARMC9 Leading to Joubert syndrome phenotype (JS30), elucidates the genetic heterogeneity of Joubert syndrome, and expands the gene list for ciliopathies.
