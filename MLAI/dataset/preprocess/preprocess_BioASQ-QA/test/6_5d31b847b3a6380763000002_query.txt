The Kr端ppel-associated box-containing zinc finger gene family (KRAB-ZNF) is one of the largest gene families of transcriptional factors in the human genome. Although the functions of most of these genes remain to be determined, it is known that KRAB-mediated transcriptional repression requires a direct interaction with the KAP1 co-repressor. By mammalian one- or two-hybrid experiments in HEK293 cells, we compared transcriptional repression activities of 61 human KRAB-ZNFs. The results showed that six SCAN-KRAB-containing ZNFs are KAP1-independent transcriptional repressors whose SCAN-KRAB domain is unable to associate with KAP1 despite retaining transcriptional repression activity. Transcriptional repression activities of the SCAN-KRAB domain of KAP1-independent KRAB-ZNFs are not influenced by depletion of endogenous KAP1 levels by small interfering RNA. Although the mechanism by which KAP1-independent KRAB-ZNFs repress transcriptional activity remains to be elucidated, it appears that there may be a pathway for transcriptional repression that does not involve KAP1. These results provide new insight into the functions of the members of the KRAB-ZNF family.

The mechanisms of speciation have been one of the most debated topics in evolutionary biology. Among all reproductive barriers, postzygotic reproductive isolation is perhaps the one that has attracted the most attention from geneticists. Despite remarkable advances in the identification of loci involved in Drosophila speciation, little is known about the genes, functions, and biochemical interactions of the molecules underlying hybrid sterility and inviability in mammals. Here, we discuss the main evolutionary and molecular features that make transcription factors (TFs), especially the family of zinc finger proteins with a Kr端ppel-associated box domain (KRAB-ZNF), strong candidates to play an important role in postzygotic reproductive isolation. Motivated by the recent identification of the gene encoding PR domain zinc finger protein 9 (Prdm9; a KRAB-ZNF gene) as the first hybrid sterility gene identified in mammals, we further propose integrative approaches to study KRAB-ZNF genes with the main goal of characterizing the molecular pathways and interactions involved in hybrid incompatibilities.

Heterochromatin is important for gene regulation and chromosome structure, but the genes that are occupied by heterochromatin proteins in the mammalian genome are largely unknown. We have adapted the DamID method to systematically identify target genes of the heterochromatin proteins HP1 and SUV39H1 in human and mouse cells. Unexpectedly, we found that CBX1 (formerly HP1beta) and SUV39H1 bind to genes encoding KRAB domain containing zinc finger (KRAB-ZNF) transcriptional repressors. These genes constitute one of the largest gene families and are organized in clusters in the human genome. Preference of CBX1 for this gene family was observed in both human and mouse cells. High-resolution mapping on human chromosome 19 revealed that CBX1 coats large domains 0.1-4 Mb in size, which coincide with the position of KRAB-ZNF gene clusters. These domains show an intricate CBX1 binding pattern: While CBX1 is globally elevated throughout the domains, it is absent from the promoters and binds more strongly to the 3' ends of KRAB-ZNF genes. KRAB-ZNF domains contain large numbers of LINE elements, which may contribute to CBX1 recruitment. These results uncover a surprising link between heterochromatin and a large family of regulatory genes in mammals. We suggest a role for heterochromatin in the evolution of the KRAB-ZNF gene family.

The KRAB-ZNF (Kr端ppel-associated box domain zinc finger) gene family is composed of a large number of highly homologous genes, gene isoforms, and pseudogenes. The proteins encoded by these genes, whose expression is often tissue-specific, act as epigenetic suppressors contributing to the addition of repressive chromatin marks and DNA methylation. Due to its high complexity, the KRAB-ZNF family has not been studied in sufficient detail, and the involvement of its members in carcinogenesis remains mostly unexplored. In this study, we aimed to provide a comprehensive description of cancer-associated KRAB-ZNFs using publicly available The Cancer Genome Atlas pan-cancer datasets. We analyzed 6727 tumor and normal tissue samples from 16 cancer types. Here, we showed that a small but distinctive cluster of 16 KRAB-ZNFs is commonly upregulated across multiple cancer cohorts in comparison to normal samples. We confirmed these observations in the independent panels of lung and breast cancer cell lines and tissues. This upregulation was also observed for most of the KRAB-ZNF splicing variants, whose expression is simultaneously upregulated in tumors compared to normal tissues. Finally, by analyzing the clinicopathological data for breast and lung cancers, we demonstrated that the expression of cancer-associated KRAB-ZNFs correlates with patient survival, tumor histology, and molecular subtyping. Altogether, our study allowed the identification and characterization of KRAB-ZNF factors that may have an essential function in cancer biology and thus potential to become novel oncologic biomarkers and treatment targets.

Reprogramming to induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) and differentiation of pluripotent stem cells (PSCs) are regulated by epigenetic machinery. Tripartite motif protein 28 (TRIM28), a universal mediator of Kr端ppel-associated box domain zinc fingers (KRAB-ZNFs), is known to regulate both processes; however, the exact mechanism and identity of participating KRAB-ZNF genes remain unknown. Here, using a reporter system, we show that TRIM28/KRAB-ZNFs alter DNA methylation patterns in addition to H3K9me3 to cause stable gene repression during reprogramming. Using several expression datasets, we identified KRAB-ZNFs (ZNF114, ZNF483, ZNF589) in the human genome that maintain pluripotency. Moreover, we identified target genes repressed by these KRAB-ZNFs. Mechanistically, we demonstrated that these KRAB-ZNFs directly alter gene expression of important developmental genes by modulating H3K9me3 and DNA methylation of their promoters. In summary, TRIM28 employs KRAB-ZNFs to evoke epigenetic silencing of its target differentiation genes via H3K9me3 and DNA methylation.

Recent segmental duplications (SDs), arising from duplication events that occurred within the past 35-40 My, have provided a major resource for the evolution of proteins with primate-specific functions. KRAB zinc finger (KRAB-ZNF) transcription factor genes are overrepresented among genes contained within these recent human SDs. Here, we examine the structural and functional diversity of the 70 human KRAB-ZNF genes involved in the most recent primate SD events including genes that arose in the hominid lineage. Despite their recent advent, many parent-daughter KRAB-ZNF gene pairs display significant differences in zinc finger structure and sequence, expression, and splicing patterns, each of which could significantly alter the regulatory functions of the paralogous genes. Paralogs that emerged on the lineage to humans and chimpanzees have undergone more evolutionary changes per unit of time than genes already present in the common ancestor of rhesus macaques and great apes. Taken together, these data indicate that a substantial fraction of the recently evolved primate-specific KRAB-ZNF gene duplicates have acquired novel functions that may possibly define novel regulatory pathways and suggest an active ongoing selection for regulatory diversity in primates.
