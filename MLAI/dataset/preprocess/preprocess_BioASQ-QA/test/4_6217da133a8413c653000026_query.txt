Uranium mining and processing are an ancient occupation, recognized as being grueling and accountable for injury and disease. Uranium (U) is a radioactive heavy metal used in many industrial applications. It increases the micronuclei frequencies as well as chromosomal aberration and sister chromatid exchange in peripheral blood lymphocytes. Granzyme B and perforin are stored inside the leukocytes in secretory granules. These proteins are released outside the cells by a cell-to-cell contact under specific conditions for inducing apoptosis. So, this study investigated the potential health hazards with prominence on the biological effects of radiation exposure. A cross-sectional analytic research was conducted on Egyptian male mining field workers. Leucocytes' genotoxicity was evaluated using DNA fragmentation assay and comet assay. Furthermore, flow cytometric analysis of Granzyme B protein was done. A significant increase in dead cells after dual acridine orange/ethidium bromide (AO/EB) fluorescent staining in radiation-exposed groups was noticed compared to control groups. Moreover, a significant increase in the fragmented DNA was evident in exposed groups relative to the control one. Granzyme B protein levels showed a significant increase concerning control. A wide variety of adverse human health risks are considered a potential risk to Egyptian uranium miners. For employers working in both mining and processing fields, the most common molecular shift highlighted was the leucocyte damage in blood samples. To preserve the health of all employees, health education and administration of effective hazard management procedures are necessary.

As part of the adaptive immune system, T cells are vital for the eradication of infected and malignantly transformed cells. To perform their protective function, T cells produce effector molecules that are either directly cytotoxic, such as granzymes, perforin, interferon-γ and tumour necrosis factor α, or attract and stimulate (immune) cells, such as interleukin-2. As these molecules can also induce immunopathology, tight control of their production is required. Indeed, inflammatory cytokine production is regulated on multiple levels. Firstly, locus accessibility and transcription factor availability and activity determine the amount of mRNA produced. Secondly, post-transcriptional mechanisms, influencing mRNA splicing/codon usage, stability, decay, localization and translation rate subsequently determine the amount of protein that is produced. In the immune suppressive environments of tumours, T cells gradually lose the capacity to produce effector molecules, resulting in tumour immune escape. Recently, the role of post-transcriptional regulation in fine-tuning T-cell effector function has become more appreciated. Furthermore, several groups have shown that exhausted or dysfunctional T cells from cancer patients or murine models possess mRNA for inflammatory mediators, but fail to produce effector molecules, hinting that post-transcriptional events also play a role in hampering tumour-infiltrating lymphocyte effector function. Here, the post-transcriptional regulatory events governing T-cell cytokine production are reviewed, with a specific focus on the importance of post-transcriptional regulation in anti-tumour responses. Furthermore, potential approaches to circumvent tumour-mediated dampening of T-cell effector function through the (dis)engagement of post-transcriptional events are explored, such as CRISPR/Cas9-mediated genome editing or chimeric antigen receptors.

Unexplained recurrent miscarriage (uRM) is defined as two or more spontaneous abortions prior to 20 weeks of gestation with unknown etiology. Peripheral blood natural killer (pNK) cells contact with the villus and exert important role in normal pregnancy. However, it is still controversial about the association between pNK cytotoxicity and uRM, and the underlying mechanism remains unknown so far. In this study, we aim to compare the percentage, immunophenotype, and function of pNK cells between patients with uRM and fertile controls. The peripheral blood was collected from 49 patients with uRM and 11 fertile women in their middle luteal phase of the menstrual cycle. pNK cells were co-cultured with K562 cells at different cell ratios to measure the cytotoxicity. The percentage of CD3<sup>-</sup> CD56<sup>+</sup> , CD3<sup>-</sup> CD56<sup>bright</sup> , and CD3<sup>-</sup> CD56<sup>dim</sup> pNK was analyzed by flow cytometry and quantified to evaluate the expression of cytotoxic granules (granzyme B, granulysin, and perforin), and the cell surface receptors related to pNK cell cytotoxicity (NKG2D, NKp30, NKp46, CD158a, and CD158b) were also detected. The general linear model analysis showed that pNK cell cytotoxicity in patients with uRM was significantly lower than that in fertile controls. In addition, the ratios of NKG2D/CD158a, NKp30/CD158a, and NKp46/CD158a in CD3<sup>-</sup> CD56<sup>bright</sup> pNK subsets were significantly lower in uRM group than that in fertile control. The logistical regression analysis showed that the reduced NKp30/CD158a, NKp46/CD158a ratios in CD3<sup>-</sup> CD56<sup>bright</sup> pNK subsets were significantly associated with uRM. Our results suggested that a low pNK cytotoxicity, which is mediated by inhibitory signals, might be associated with uRM.

Severe malaria caused by <i>Plasmodium falciparum</i> poses a major global health problem with high morbidity and mortality. <i>P. falciparum</i> harbors a family of pore-forming proteins (PFPs), known as perforin like proteins (PLPs), which are structurally equivalent to prokaryotic PFPs. These PLPs are secreted from the parasites and, they contribute to disease pathogenesis by interacting with host cells. The severe malaria pathogenesis is associated with the dysfunction of various barrier cells, including endothelial cells (EC). Several factors, including PLPs secreted by parasites, contribute to the host cell dysfunction. Herein, we have tested the hypothesis that PLPs mediate dysfunction of barrier cells and might have a role in disease pathogenesis. We analyzed various dysfunctions in barrier cells following rPLP2 exposure and demonstrate that it causes an increase in intracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> levels. Additionally, rPLP2 exposed barrier cells displayed features of cell death, including Annexin/PI positivity, depolarized the mitochondrial membrane potential, and ROS generation. We have further performed the time-lapse video microscopy of barrier cells and found that the treatment of rPLP2 triggers their membrane blebbing. The cytoplasmic localization of HMGB1, a marker of necrosis, further confirmed the necrotic type of cell death. This study highlights the role of parasite factor PLP in endothelial dysfunction and provides a rationale for the design of adjunct therapies against severe malaria.
