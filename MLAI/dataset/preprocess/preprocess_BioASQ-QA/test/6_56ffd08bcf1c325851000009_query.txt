From which sequence does the Alu repeat originate from?

To get insight into the early evolution of the primate Alu elements, we characterized sequences of these repeats from the Malagasy prosimians, lemurs (Lemuridae) and sifakas (Indriidae), as well as from galagos (Lorisidae). These sequences were compared with the oldest Alu species known from the human genome: dimeric Alu J and S and free Alu monomers. Our analysis indicates that about 60 Myr ago, before the prosimian divergence, free left and right monomers formed an Alu heterodimer connected by a 19-nucleotide-long A-rich linker. The resulting elements successfully propagated in diverging primate lineages until about approximately 20 Myr ago, conserving similar sequence features and essentially the same Alu RNA secondary structure. We suggest that until that time the same "retropositional niche", molecular machinery making possible the proliferation by retroposition, constrained the evolution of Alu elements in extant primate species. These constraints became subsequently relaxed. In the Malagasy prosimians the dimeric Alu continued to amplify after acquiring a 34- to 36-nucleotide extension of their linker segment, whereas in the galago genome the "retropositional niche" was occupied by novel short elements.

We have determined sequences of PCR-amplified B1 elements from hamster and rat (Myomorpha), chipmunk (Sciuromorpha), and guinea pig (Caviomorpha). Between three and six B1 subfamilies were found in these species. In the phylogenetic analysis B1 sequences of hamster, mouse, and rat clustered separately from those of chipmunk and those of guinea pig. This is consistent with an independent evolution of B1 elements in separate rodent lineages. We exclude the possibility of convergent mutations to explain certain diagnostic characters within the modern B1 quasi-dimers and view these elements as mosaic structures assembling preexisting mutations. Furthermore, the presence of Alu-like structural motifs supports the hypothesis of the monophyletic origin of Alu and B1 repeats, i.e., from a common 7SL RNA-derived retroposing monomeric element.

We analyze minisatellites derived from Alu fragments corresponding approximately to the first 44 bases of human Alu consensus sequences from different subfamilies. The origin of Alu-derived minisatellites appears to have been mediated by short flanking repeats, as first proposed by Haber and Louis [Haber, J.E., Louis, E.J., 1998. Minisatellite origins in yeast and humans. Genomics 48, 132-135.]. We also present evidence for base substitutions and deletions introduced to minisatellites by gene conversion with partially similar but unrelated flanking regions. Segments flanked by short direct repeats are relatively common in different regions of Alu and other repetitive sequences. Our analysis shows that they can be effectively used in comparative studies of the overall sequence context which may contribute to instability of DNA segments flanked by short direct repeats.

Highly repetitive DNA sequences account for more than 50% of the human genome. The L1 and Alu families harbor the most common mammalian long (LINEs) and short (SINEs) interspersed elements. Alu elements are each a dimer of similar, but not identical, fragments of total size about 300 bp, and originate from the 7SL RNA gene. Each element contains a bipartite promoter for RNA polymerase III, a poly(A) tract located between the monomers, a 3'-terminal poly(A) tract, and numerous CpG islands, and is flanked by short direct repeats. Alu repeats comprise more than 10% of the human genome and are capable of retroposition. Possibly, these elements played an important part in genome evolution. Insertion of an Alu element into a functionally important genome region or other Alu-dependent alterations of gene functions cause various hereditary disorders and are probably associated with carcinogenesis. In total, 14 Alu families differing in diagnostic mutations are known. Some of these, which are present in the human genome, are polymorphic and relatively recently inserted into new loci. Alu copies transposed during ethnic divergence of the human population are useful markers for evolutionary genetic studies.

Repetitive elements are distributed non-randomly in the human genome but, as reviewed in this paper, biological processes underlying the observed patterns appear to be complex and remain relatively obscure. Recent findings indicate that chromosomal distribution of Alu retroelements deposited in the past is different from the distribution of Alu elements that continue to be inserted in human population. These active elements from AluY sub(sub)families are the major focus of this paper. In particular, we analyzed chromosomal proportions of 19 AluY subfamilies, of which nine are reported for the first time in this paper. These 19 subfamilies contain over 80% of Alu elements that are polymorphic in the human genome. The chromosomal density of these most recent Alu insertions is around three times higher on chromosome Y than on chromosome X and over two times higher than the average density for all human autosomes. Based on this observation and other data we propose that active Alu elements are passed through paternal germlines. There is also some evidence that a small fraction of active Alu elements from less abundant subfamilies can be retroposed in female germlines or in the early embryos. Finally, we propose that the origin of Alu subfamilies in human populations may be related to evolution of chromosome Y.

Alu sequences are frequently encountered during study of human genomic nucleic acid and form a major component of repetitive DNA. This review describes the origin of Alu sequences and their subsequent amplification and evolution into distinct subfamilies. In recent years a number of different functional roles for Alu sequences have been described. The multiple influences of Alu sequences on RNA polymerase II-mediated gene expression and the presence of Alu sequences in RNA polymerase III-generated transcripts are discussed.
