What is ECMO?

[PMID: 32144062]
Over the last decade, the use of extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) has increased significantly. In some centers, ECMO has been deployed to manage perioperative emergencies and plays a role in facilitating high-risk thoracic, airway, and trauma surgery, which may not be feasible without ECMO support. General anesthesiologists who usually manage these cases may not be familiar with the initiation and management of patients on ECMO. This review discusses the use of ECMO in the operating room for thoracic, airway, and trauma surgery, as well as obstetric and perioperative emergencies.

To present a rare case of a post-partum spontaneous coronary artery dissection (SCAD), a rarely seen condition which does not yet have a universally agreed treatment method and the role of the intensive care unit (ICU) nurse when caring for the adult ECMO patient. The use of extra-corporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) for the adult patient has increased slowly since the first reported successful treatment in 1972 (Hill et al., 1972) and is seen increasingly as a successful therapy when conventional medical treatment has failed. In this case, a young lady 2 weeks post-partum presented with acute coronary syndrome secondary to a SCAD. ECMO was used successfully as a bridge to myocardial recovery following coronary artery bypass grafts and cardiogenic shock. A case study underpinned by a review of existing literature relating to spontaneous coronary artery dissection and extra-corporeal membrane oxygenation. ECMO is still a relatively new and invasive technology but continues to improve survival rates in critically ill patients where conventional medical treatment has failed. This article highlights requirement for further research into several aspects of care for the adult ECMO patient. Questions to be answered raised in this case study include recommendations for the weaning of inotropes and vasoconstrictors, frequency of blood gas sampling and whether it remains essential to have two nurses caring for the ECMO patient. As medical treatment progresses, there is an increasing demand for therapies such as ECMO to become more readily available for the care of the critically ill adult patient. This article highlights challenges that may be faced and what changes could be made to further improve standards of care and survival rates for ECMO patients.

Extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) is a widely used technique for treating postcardiotomy cardiogenic shock (PCS); however, no study has compared the long-term outcomes of patients who receive ECMO support for PCS with those of the general population post cardiac surgery. A total of 1141 patients who received ECMO after cardiac surgery between 2000 and 2011 were identified by using the Taiwan National Health Insurance Research Database. For each patient, we matched 5 non-ECMO patients who had undergone cardiac surgery by using propensity scores calculated for age, sex, 12 comorbid diseases, Charlson score, hospital level, type of cardiac surgery, and year of index hospitalization. The outcomes included all-cause mortality, readmission for any cause, and medical expenditure. The incidence of ECMO use after cardiac surgery in Taiwan was 1.91%. The ECMO group had a significantly higher risk of in-hospital mortality than did the non-ECMO group (61.7% vs 6.8%, odds ratio 22.34, 95% confidence interval 19.06-26.18). The risks of all-cause mortality and first readmission for any cause were greater in the ECMO group than that in the control group (P < .001, P < .001) in the first year, whereas no difference was observed after the first year of follow-up (P = .209, P = .474). Similar results were observed regarding the medical expenditure of admission after index admission discharge. Patients receiving ECMO for PCS had similar outcomes to those of the non-ECMO group after the first year of follow-up despite significantly poor outcomes during the in-hospital course.

Extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) is a support modality used within the pediatric cardiac ICU population as a bridge to recovery or decision in the setting of acute myocardial decompensation, support for combined cardiopulmonary failure or in the setting of refractory cardiopulmonary arrest. Patients with univentricular physiology are at particular risk for decompensation requiring ECMO support. This review will focus upon current evidence and techniques for ECMO support of single ventricle patients who have undergone a stage II bidirectional Glenn procedure or the stage III Fontan procedure.

Extra Corporeal Membrane Oxygenation (ECMO) is used in cases of severe respiratory and/or circulatory failure over periods of several days to several weeks. Its circuitry requires a closely monitored anticoagulation therapy that is empirically supported by activated clotting time (ACT)-a method often associated with large inter- and intraindividual variability. We aimed to compare the measurement of heparin activity with ACT and the direct measurement of the heparin activity (anti-Xa) in a large ECMO population. All patients treated by venoarterial or venovenous ECMO in our intensive care unit between January 2014 and December 2015 were prospectively included. A concomitant measurement of the anti-Xa activity and ACT was performed on the same sample collected twice a day (morning-evening) for unfractionated heparin adaptation with an ACT target range of 180 to 220 seconds. One hundred and nine patients (men 69.7%, median age 54 years) treated with ECMO (70.6% venoarterial) were included. Spearman analysis found no correlation between anti-Xa and ACT (ρ < 0.4) from day 1 and worsened over time. Kappa analysis showed no agreement between the respective target ranges of ACT and anti-Xa. We demonstrate that concomitant measurement of ACT and anti-Xa activity is irrelevant in ECMO patients. Since ACT is poorly correlated with heparin dosage, anti-Xa activity appears to be a more suitable assay for anticoagulation monitoring.

Neonatal extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) is a lifesaving therapeutic approach in newborns suffering from severe, but potentially reversible, respiratory insufficiency, mostly complicated by neonatal persistent pulmonary hypertension. However, cerebral damage, intracerebral hemorrhage as well as ischemia belong to the most devastating complications of ECMO. The objectives are to give insights into what is known from the literature concerning cerebral damage related to neonatal ECMO treatment for pulmonary reasons. A short introduction to ECMO indications and technical aspects of ECMO are provided for a better understanding of the process. The remainder of this review focuses on outcome and especially on (potential) risk factors for cerebral hemorrhage and ischemia during ECMO treatment. Although neonatal ECMO treatment shows improved outcome compared to conservative treatment in cases of severe respiratory insufficiency, it is related to disturbances in various aspects of neurodevelopmental outcome. Risk factors for cerebral damage are either related to the patient's disease, EMCO treatment itself, or a combination of both. It is of ongoing importance to further understand pathophysiological mechanisms resulting in cerebral hemorrhage and ischemia due to ECMO and to develop neuroprotective strategies and approaches.

This article reviews the results of case series and trials which evaluated venovenous extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (VV-ECMO) for severe respiratory failure. Potential indications of the technique in this setting are discussed. Major technological improvements in extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) machines and the positive results of the conventional ventilatory support versus extracorporeal membrane oxygenation for severe adult respiratory failure (CESAR) trial have reignited interest in VV-ECMO in patients with severe acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and persistent hypoxemia or hypercarbia on conventional mechanical ventilation. The technique has also been successfully used as a rescue therapy for the most severe ARDS cases associated with the recent Influenza A(H1N1) pandemic. However, as the CESAR study was criticized for methodological limitations and because results of nonrandomized case-series of ECMO are prone to selection biases, indications for VV-ECMO remain highly controversial. Before widespread diffusion of VV-ECMO for severe ARDS, new trials should test the efficacy of early initiation of the technique with tight control of mechanical ventilation in the control group, initiation of ECMO prior to transportation to ECMO centers, and the use of ECMO in every patient randomly assigned to receive it.

Extracorporeal Membrane Oxygenation (ECMO) represents a useful tool to support the lungs and the heart when all conventional therapies failed and the patients are at risk of death. While the Extracorporeal Life Support Organization (ELSO) collects data from different institutions that joined the Registry and reports overall outcome, individual centres often collide with results below expectations, either in adults and in paediatric population. Some authors suggest that poor outcomes could be overcome with a programme dedicated to ECMO, with specialized professionals adequately trained on ECMO and with a consistent number of procedures. In 2012, The IRCCS PSD ECMO Programme was instituted with the specific aim of achieving better results than hitherto obtained. After only 1 year of activity, the results justified the programme, with a better survival rate for each group investigated, particularly in adults, but surprisingly in paediatrics too, where the results were better than what reported by ELSO. Although the number of patients treated with ECMO is still growing up, the effects of the ECMO programme continue to exert a positive action on outcome even now. The present article reports data on survival, blood loss, and blood consumption during ECMO in the last few years at our institution.

Extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) is a form of life support that targets the heart and lungs. Extracorporeal membrane oxygenation for severe respiratory failure accesses and returns blood from the venous system and provides non-pulmonary gas exchange. Extracorporeal membrane oxygenation for severe cardiac failure or for refractory cardiac arrest (extracorporeal cardiopulmonary resuscitation (ECPR)) provides gas exchange and systemic circulation. The configuration of ECMO is variable, and several pump-driven and pump-free systems are in use. Use of ECMO is associated with several risks. Patient-related adverse events include haemorrhage or extremity ischaemia; circuit-related adverse effects may include pump failure, oxygenator failure and thrombus formation. Use of ECMO in newborns and infants is well established, yet its clinical effectiveness in adults remains uncertain. The primary objective of this systematic review was to determine whether use of veno-venous (VV) or venous-arterial (VA) ECMO in adults is more effective in improving survival compared with conventional respiratory and cardiac support. We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE (Ovid) and EMBASE (Ovid) on 18 August 2014. We searched conference proceedings, meeting abstracts, reference lists of retrieved articles and databases of ongoing trials and contacted experts in the field. We imposed no restrictions on language or location of publications. We included randomized controlled trials (RCTs), quasi-RCTs and cluster-RCTs that compared adult ECMO versus conventional support. Two review authors independently screened the titles and abstracts of all retrieved citations against the inclusion criteria. We independently reviewed full-text copies of studies that met the inclusion criteria. We entered all data extracted from the included studies into Review Manager. Two review authors independently performed risk of bias assessment. All included studies were appraised with respect to random sequence generation, concealment of allocation, blinding of outcome assessment, incomplete outcome data, selective reporting and other bias. We included four RCTs that randomly assigned 389 participants with acute respiratory failure. Risk of bias was low in three RCTs and high in one RCT. We found no statistically significant differences in all-cause mortality at six months (two RCTs) or before six months (during 30 days of randomization in one trial and during hospital stay in another RCT). The quality of the evidence was low to moderate, and further research is very likely to impact our confidence in the estimate of effects because significant changes have been noted in ECMO applications and treatment modalities over study periods to the present.Two RCTs supplied data on disability. In one RCT survival was low in both groups but none of the survivors had limitations in their daily activities six months after discharge. The other RCT reported improved survival without severe disability in the intervention group (transfer to an ECMO centre ± ECMO) six months after study randomization but no statistically significant differences in health-related quality of life.In three RCTs, participants in the ECMO group received greater numbers of blood transfusions. One RCT recorded significantly more non-brain haemorrhage in the ECMO group. Another RCT reported two serious adverse events in the ECMO group, and another reported three adverse events in the ECMO group.Clinical heterogeneity between studies prevented meta-analyses across outcomes. We found no completed RCT that had investigated ECMO in the context of cardiac failure or arrest. We found one ongoing RCT that examined patients with acute respiratory failure and two ongoing RCTs that included patients with acute cardiac failure (arrest). Extracorporeal membrane oxygenation remains a rescue therapy. Since the year 2000, patient treatment and practice with ECMO have considerably changed as the result of research findings and technological advancements over time. Over the past four decades, only four RCTs have been published that compared the intervention versus conventional treatment at the time of the study. Clinical heterogeneity across these published studies prevented pooling of data for a meta-analysis.We recommend combining results of ongoing RCTs with results of trials conducted after the year 2000 if no significant shifts in technology or treatment occur. Until these new results become available, data on use of ECMO in patients with acute respiratory failure remain inconclusive. For patients with acute cardiac failure or arrest, outcomes of ongoing RCTs will assist clinicians in determining what role ECMO and ECPR can play in patient care.

Extracorporeal membrane oxygen (ECMO) has been used for many years in patients with life-threatening hypoxaemia and/or hypercarbia. While early trials demonstrated that it was associated with poor outcomes and extensive haemorrhage, the technique has evolved. It now encompasses new technologies and understanding that the lung protective mechanical ventilation it can facilitate is inextricably linked to improving outcomes for patients. The positive results from the CESAR (Conventional ventilation or ECMO for Severe Adult Respiratory failure) study and excellent outcomes in patients who suffered severe influenza A (H1N1/09) infection have established ECMO in the care of patients with severe acute respiratory distress syndrome. Controversy remains as to at what point in the clinical pathway ECMO should be employed; as a rescue therapy or more pro-actively to enable and ensure high-quality lung protective mechanical ventilation. The primary aims of this article are to discuss: 1) the types of extracorporeal support available; 2) the rationale for its use; 3) the relationship with lung protective ventilation; and 4) the current evidence for its use.

Extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) is the short-term (days to weeks) support of patients with severe respiratory and/or cardiac failure. The use of these devices has been well established in paediatric and post-heart and lung transplantation patients; however, its use in patients with severe acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) has gained acceptance as standard clinical practice over the past decade. The results of the CESAR trial (Conventional ventilation or ECMO for Severe Adult Respiratory failure) showed significant survival benefit for patients with ARDS undergoing ECMO. Substantial numbers of radiological examinations are performed in this patient group, prompting the need for general radiologists to understand the radiological appearances of these devices and associated complications. In this review, we highlight the uses, subtypes, physiology, normal appearances, and complications of ECMO. An example of the chronological radiographic images in the perioperative period demonstrates the importance of discriminating normal appearances associated with EMCO.

Extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) is a method of life support to maintain cardiopulmonary function. Its use as a medical application has increased since its inception to treat multiple conditions including acute respiratory distress syndrome, myocardial ischemia, cardiomyopathy, and septic shock. While complications including neurological and renal injury occur in patients on ECMO, bleeding and coagulopathy are most common. ECMO is associated with an inflammatory response promoting a hypercoagulable state, requiring anticoagulation to avoid thromboembolism originating in the nonendothelial surfaced circuit. However, excessive anticoagulation may result in bleeding complications including intracerebral hemorrhage. Monitoring anticoagulation for ECMO has its origins in cardiopulmonary bypass for cardiac surgery; however, there is no ideal level of anticoagulation, no standardized method to monitor anticoagulation, nor are all centers standardized on what is used for anticoagulation. Multiple blood products are used in an effort to decrease bleeding in the setting of anticoagulation, often in the setting of recent surgery, and this leads to significant increases in cost for patients on ECMO and transfusion-related complications. In this review article, we discuss the evolution of the various modalities of ECMO, indications, contraindications, and complications. Furthermore, we review the different strategies for anticoagulation and treatment of coagulopathy while on ECMO. Finally, we discuss the cost of ECMO and associated blood product transfusion.

Extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) is a life-saving system used for critically ill patients with cardiac and/or respiratory failure. The pharmacokinetics (PK) of drugs can change in patients undergoing ECMO, which can result in therapeutic failure or drug toxicity requiring further management of drug complications. In this review, we discussed changes in the PK of antibiotic, antiviral, antituberculosis and antifungal agents administered to adult patients on ECMO. These drugs are crucial for managing infections, which commonly occur during ECMO. A literature search was conducted using the PubMed and EMBASE databases with the following keywords: "extracorporeal membrane oxygenation OR extracorporeal membrane oxygenations OR ECMO" and "PK OR pharmacokinetics OR pharmacokinetic*" and "anti infective* OR antibiotic* OR antiviral* OR antituberculosis OR antifungal*." Generally, the volume of distribution (Vd) increases and drug clearance (CL) and elimination decrease during ECMO. Highly significant changes in drug PK can occur by interactions with the ECMO device itself, drug characteristics, pathological changes and patient characteristics. This may affect the blood concentrations of drugs, which influence the success of therapy. The PK of vancomycin, piperacillin-tazobactam, meropenem, azithromycin, amikacin and caspofungin did not change significantly in adult patients receiving ECMO. However, there were significant changes in the PK of imipenem, oseltamivir, rifampicin and voriconazole. The trough concentrations of imipenem were highly variable; oseltamivir had a decreased CL and increased Vd, and rifampicin concentrations were below therapeutic levels, even when a higher-than-standard dose was used in patients treated with ECMO. Additionally, voriconazole exhibited high mean peak concentrations during ECMO. The impact of ECMO on PK varies among drugs in adult patients, and there is no consistent correlation between the effects observed in adult and infant studies. This review suggested that doses of imipenem, oseltamivir, rifampicin and voriconazole should be adjusted and therapeutic drug monitoring is needed when ECMO is used in adult patients. In the future, large PK trials in adults on ECMO are needed to provide optimal dosing guidelines. A PK/PD modelling approach will be useful for determining the precise impact of ECMO and other factors that contribute to PK changes for each drug. Finally, it is important to develop dosing guidelines based on PK/PD modelling studies that can be used in clinical practice.

Extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) is an increasingly prevalent treatment for acute respiratory failure (ARF). To evaluate the impact of ECMO support on long-term outcomes for critically ill adults with ARF. We searched electronic databases 1948 through to November 30 2016; selected controlled trials or observational studies of critically ill adults with acute respiratory distress syndrome, examining long-term morbidity specifically health-related quality of life (HRQL); 2 authors independently selected studies, extracted data, and assessed methodological quality. Of the 633 citations, 1 randomized controlled trial and 5 observational studies met the selection criteria. Overall quality of observational studies was moderate to high (mean score on Newcastle-Ottawa scale, 7.2/9; range, 6-8). In 3 studies (n = 245), greater decrements in HRQL were seen for survivors of ECMO when compared to survivors of conventional mechanical ventilation (CMV) as measured by the Short Form 36 (SF-36) scores ([ECMO-CMV]: 5.40 [95% confidence interval, CI, 4.11 to 6.68]). As compared to CMV survivors, those who received ECMO experienced significantly less psychological morbidity (2 studies; n = 217 [ECMO-CMV]: mean weighted difference [MWD], -1.31 [95% CI, -1.98 to -0.64] for depression and MWD, -1.60 [95% CI, -1.80 to -1.39] for anxiety). Further studies are required to confirm findings and determine prognostic factors associated with more favorable outcomes in survivors of ECMO.

Extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) support is a logical means of providing time for the acutely damaged lung to heal. To be successful, the lung pathology must be reversible. There are four extracorporeal cannulation methods that can be used. Each method has its advantages and disadvantages depending upon what one wishes to accomplish; each has been successful. But ECMO in unselected patients with severe acute respiratory insufficiency is only 15-20 percent successful. The limiting factor for success is the potential reversibility of the lung pathology. Therefore, much attention is now being focused on identifying those patients who have reversible disease and would benefit from ECMO. Because serious bleeding is the biggest potential risk of ECMO therapy, antithrombogenic surfaces are being developed.

Access to centers with extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) capabilities varies by region and may affect overall outcomes. We assessed the outcomes of trauma patients requiring ECMO support and compared the overall survival of all patients with trauma at facilities with and without ECMO capabilities. A retrospective review of the National Trauma Data Bank was performed to identify all trauma patients receiving care at ECMO and non-ECMO centers. Baseline patient characteristics and outcomes were analyzed. Adjusted odds ratio (OR) was used to compare survival at ECMO and non-ECMO facilities. Between 2007 and 2015, a total of 5 781 123 patients with trauma were identified with 1 983 986 (34%) admitted to an ECMO facility and 3 797 137 (66%) admitted to a non-ECMO facility. A total of 522 (0.03%) patients required ECMO. Both the number of patients with trauma requiring ECMO support and the number of trauma facilities utilizing ECMO increased over the 9-year-study period (4.9 to 13.8 patients per 100 000 admissions, and 18 to 77 centers, respectively). The mortality for ECMO patients was 40.5%. Patients with trauma admitted to ECMO facilities had more severe injuries (injury severity score: 9.0 vs 8.0; P < .001). The overall mortality was 3.3%. The adjusted OR for mortality associated with admission to an ECMO facility vs a non-ECMO facility was 0.96 (95% confidence interval: 0.95-0.97; adjusted P < .001). The use of ECMO for patients with trauma is expanding. Our study demonstrates a survival benefit associated with admission to a facility with ECMO capabilities. Thus, access to ECMO is a potential quality metric for trauma centers.

Extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) is a form of long-term cardiopulmonary bypass used to treat infants, children, and adults with respiratory and/or cardiac failure despite maximal medical therapy. Mechanical emergencies on extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) have an associated mortality of 25%. Thus, acquiring and maintaining the technical, behavioral, and critical thinking skills necessary to manage ECMO emergencies is essential to patient survival. Traditional training in ECMO management is primarily didactic in nature and usually complemented with varying degrees of hands-on training using a water-filled ECMO circuit. These traditional training methods do not provide an opportunity for trainees to recognize and interpret real-time clinical cues generated by human patients and their monitoring equipment. Adult learners are most likely to acquire such skills in an active learning environment. To provide authentic, intensive, interactive ECMO training without risk to real patients, we used methodologies pioneered by the aerospace industry and our experience developing a simulation-based training program in neonatal resuscitation to develop a similar simulation-based training program in ECMO crisis management, ECMO Sim. A survey was conducted at the 19th Annual Children's National Medical Center ECMO Symposium to determine current methods for ECMO training. Using commercially available technology, we linked a neonatal manikin with a standard neonatal ECMO circuit primed with artificial blood. Both the manikin and circuit were placed in a simulated neonatal intensive care unit environment equipped with remotely controlled monitors, real medical equipment and human colleagues. Twenty-five healthcare professionals, all of whom care for patients on ECMO and who underwent traditional ECMO training in the prior year, participated in a series of simulated ECMO emergencies. At the conclusion of the program, subjects completed a questionnaire qualitatively comparing ECMO Sim with their previous traditional ECMO training experience. The amount of time spent engaged in active and passive activities during both ECMO Sim and traditional ECMO training was quantified by review of videotape of each program. Hospitals currently use lectures, multiple-choice exams, water drills, and animal laboratory testing for their ECMO training. Modification of the circuit allowed for physiologically appropriate circuit pressures (both pre- and postoxygenator) to be achieved while circulating artificial blood continuously through the circuit and manikin. Realistic changes in vital signs on the bedside monitor and fluctuations in the mixed venous oxygen saturation monitor were also effectively achieved remotely. All subjects rated the realism of the scenarios as good or excellent and described ECMO Sim as more effective than traditional ECMO training. They reported that ECMO Sim engaged their intellect to a greater degree and better developed their technical, behavioral, and critical thinking skills. Active learning (eg, hands-on activities) comprised 78% of the total ECMO Sim program compared with 14% for traditional ECMO training (P < 0.001). Instructor-led lectures predominated in traditional ECMO training. Traditional ECMO training programs have yet to incorporate simulation-based methodology. Using current technology it is possible to realistically simulate in real-time the clinical cues (visual, auditory, and tactile) generated by a patient on ECMO. ECMO Sim as a training program provides more opportunities for active learning than traditional training programs in ECMO management and is overwhelmingly preferred by the experienced healthcare professionals serving as subjects in this study. Subjects also indicated that they felt that the acquisition of key cognitive, technical, and behavioral skills and transfer of those skills to the real medical domain was better achieved during simulation-based training.

Extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) use in adults is rapidly increasing in its use for both cardiac and respiratory failure. ECMO exists in 2 primary configurations: veno-venous ECMO, used in the setting of isolated respiratory failure, and veno-arterial ECMO, which can be used in respiratory failure but is mandatory in the setting of cardiac failure. Acute kidney injury occurs frequently in patients on ECMO, and renal replacement therapy is often required. Continuous forms of renal replacement therapy predominate, but there is a high degree of variation in clinical practice among ECMO centers internationally. No consensus exists regarding the optimal technique, but the use of continuous renal replacement machines has been shown to be safe and effective in patients on ECMO. An understanding of the basic principles and functionality of ECMO is important for both acid-base and fluid management in the intensive care unit.

Optimal timing of congenital diaphragmatic hernia (CDH) repair in patients requiring extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) remains controversial. The "late ECMO repair" is an approach where the patient, once deemed stable for decannulation, is repaired while still on ECMO to enable expeditious return to ECMO if surgery induces instability. The goal of this study was to investigate the potential benefit of this approach by evaluating the rate of return to ECMO after repair. The CDH Study Group database was used to analyze CDH patients requiring ECMO support. The primary outcome was return to ECMO within 72 h of CDH repair among those repaired following ECMO decannulation ("post-ECMO" patients). Secondary outcomes were death within 72 h of repair and cumulative death and return to ECMO rate. A total of 668 patients were repaired post-ECMO decannulation. Six patients (0.9%) in the post-ECMO group required return to ECMO within 72 h of surgery and a total of 19 (2.8%) died or returned to ECMO within 72 h of surgery. The rate of return to ECMO and death following CDH repair is extremely low and does not justify the risks inherent to "on-ECMO" repair. Patients stable to come off ECMO should undergo repair after decannulation.

Extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) is a kind of technique that uses extracorporeal circulation system to draw patients' blood into the circuit, and then oxygenate the blood when it passes along the membrane, followed by returning the blood into patients. At present, ECMO is mainly used in treating patients with respiratory failure and circulatory failure, for whom the conventional treatment such as mechanical ventilation and vasoactive drugs are invalid. ECMO can provide cardiopulmonary support for burn patients with respiratory failure or circulatory failure, and put the heart and lung at rest. The purpose of this paper is to review the application of ECMO in the treatment of severe burn.

Mortality of patients on extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) remains high. The objectives of this study were to assess the factors associated with outcome of patients undergoing ECMO in a large ECMO referral centre and to compare veno-arterial ECMO (VA ECMO) with veno-venous ECMO (VV ECMO). We reviewed a prospectively obtained ECMO database and patients' medical records between January 2005 and June 2011. Demographic characteristics, illness severity at admission, ECMO indication, organ failure scores before ECMO and the ECMO mode and configuration were recorded. Bleeding, neurological, vascular and infectious complications that occurred on ECMO were also collected. Demographic, illness, ECMO support descriptors and complications associated with hospital mortality were analysed. ECMO was initiated 158 times in 151 patients. VA ECMO (66.5%) was twice as common as VV ECMO (33.5%) with a median duration significantly shorter than for VV ECMO (7 days (first and third quartiles: 5; 10 days) versus 10 days (first and third quartiles: 6; 16 days)). The most frequent complications during ECMO support were bleeding and bloodstream infections regardless of ECMO type. More than 70% of the ECMO episodes were successfully weaned in each ECMO group. The overall mortality was 37.3% (37.1% for the patients who underwent VA ECMO, and 37.7% for the patients who underwent VV ECMO). Haemorrhagic events, assessed by the total of red blood cell units received during ECMO, were associated with hospital mortality for both ECMO types. Among neurologic, vascular, infectious and bleeding events that occurred on ECMO, bleeding was the most frequent and had a significant impact on mortality. Further studies are needed to better investigate bleeding and coagulopathy in these patients. Interventions that reduce these complications may improve outcome.

To evaluate the quality and value of contrast-enhanced (CE) chest- and abdominal computed tomography (CT) and CT angiography in neonates, children, and adults undergoing extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) using a customized protocol for contrast delivery. All patients admitted for CE thoracic- and/or abdominal CT while on ECMO were prospectively included in the study. A protocol for contrast delivery adapted for the type of ECMO circulation, cannulation sites, anatomy of interest, and desired contrast phase was applied. Clinical information, ECMO and CT technique, including contrast administration strategy, was noted for each patient. Two radiologists separately evaluated the quality of the scan. The value of the examination was decided in consensus with the referring ECMO physician. One hundred thirty CE thoracoabdominal scans were performed at 103 different occasions during the study time. Eighty-nine scans were performed during veno-arterial ECMO and 41 during veno-venous ECMO. In the majority, contrast was delivered to the oxygenator with preserved ECMO flow. A peripheral or central venous line with reduced flow was utilized in the remaining cases. Mean scan quality was graded 4.2 on a five-grade scale. In 56% of the examinations, the findings affected the immediate treatment of the patient. High-quality CT and CT angiography can be achieved in ECMO patients of different ages and clinical issues considering the type of ECMO circulation, ECMO cannulation sites, preferred contrast phase and anatomy of interest. CT diagnoses affect the treatment of the patient.

H1N1 influenza can cause severe acute lung injury (ALI). Extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) can support gas exchange in patients failing conventional mechanical ventilation, but its role is still controversial. We conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis on ECMO for H1N1-associated ALI. CENTRAL, Google Scholar, MEDLINE/PubMed and Scopus (updated 2 January 2012) were systematically searched. Studies reporting on 10 or more patients with H1N1 infection treated with ECMO were included. Baseline, procedural, outcome and validity data were systematically appraised and pooled, when appropriate, with random-effect methods. From 1,196 initial citations, 8 studies were selected, including 1,357 patients with confirmed/suspected H1N1 infection requiring intensive care unit admission, 266 (20%) of whom were treated with ECMO. Patients had a median Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (SOFA) score of 9, and had received mechanical ventilation before ECMO implementation for a median of two days. ECMO was implanted before inter-hospital patient transfer in 72% of cases and in most patients (94%) the veno-venous configuration was used. ECMO was maintained for a median of 10 days. Outcomes were highly variable among the included studies, with in-hospital or short-term mortality ranging between 8% and 65%, mainly depending on baseline patient features. Random-effect pooled estimates suggested an overall in-hospital mortality of 28% (95% confidence interval 18% to 37%; I² = 64%). ECMO is feasible and effective in patients with ALI due to H1N1 infection. Despite this, prolonged support (more than one week) is required in most cases, and subjects with severe comorbidities or multiorgan failure remain at high risk of in-hospital death.

Extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) is a temporary technique for providing life support for cardiac dysfunction, pulmonary dysfunction, or both. The two forms of ECMO, veno-arterial (VA) and veno-venous (VV), are used to support cardiopulmonary and pulmonary dysfunction, respectively. Historically, ECMO was predominantly used in the neonatal and pediatric populations, as early adult studies failed to improve outcomes. ECMO has become far more common in the adult population because of positive results in published case series and clinical trials during the 2009 influenza A(H1N1) pandemic in 2009 to 2010. Advances in technology that make the technique much easier to implement likely fueled the renewed interest. Although exact criteria for ECMO are not available, patients who are good candidates are generally considered to be relatively young and suffering from acute illness that is believed to be reversible or organ dysfunction that is otherwise treatable. With the increase in the use in the adult population, a number of different codes have been generated to better identify the method of support with distinctly different relative value units assigned to each code from a very simple prior coding scheme. To effectively be reimbursed for use of the technique, it is imperative that the clinician understands the new coding scheme and works with payers to determine what is incorporated into each specific code.

Extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) is used to support patients with cardiopulmonary failure in the intensive care unit. The purpose of this study is to determine what professional qualifications, equipment, and tests are used by established ECMO programs registered with the Extracorporeal Life Support Organization (ELSO). A survey link (Survey-Monkey) was e-mailed to the 110 registered ELSO program coordinators. Forty-nine responses were received. A test of binomial portions showed that nurses were more likely to be ECMO providers than respiratory therapists or perfusionists (p < .05). A chi2 test identified a difference in the type of pump (roller or centrifugal) based on patient age (p < .005). The most common monitoring/safety devices were battery back-up (84%), pre- and post-oxygenator pressure (82%), mixed venous oxygen saturation (80%),venous line pressure (76%), blood flowmeter (63%),bubble detector (61%), point-of-care blood gases (59%), and in-line blood gas monitoring (47%). Laboratory tests available included d-dimer (65%), plasma-free hemoglobin (63%), anti-Xa plasma heparin concentration (43%), thromboelastograph (37%), and heparin concentration using protamine titration (35%). This survey of ELSO-registered centers represents an overview of current ECMO practices.
