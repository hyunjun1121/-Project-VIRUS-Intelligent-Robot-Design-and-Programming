CURB65 score is used for stratification of which disease?

[PMID: 26874956]
Community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) is the leading cause of infectious death in the world. Immune dysregulation during acute lung infection plays a role in lung injury and the systemic inflammatory response. Cytokines seem to be major players in severe lung infection cases. Here, we present a review of published papers in the last 3 years regarding this topic. The cytokine response during pneumonia is different in bacterial vs viral infections; some of these cytokines correlate with clinical severity scales such as CURB65 or SOFA. Treatment focused in the cytokine environment is an interesting area that could impact the prognosis of CAP. Some of the agents that have been studied as co-adjuvant therapy are corticosteroids, macrolides, and linezolid, but anyone of those have shown a clear or proven efficacy or have been recommended as a part of the standard of care for CAP. More studies designed to define the role of immunomodulatory agents, such as co-adjuvant therapy in pneumonia, are needed.

Hospitalization for exacerbation of COPD is associated with a high risk of mortality. A risk-prediction model using information easily obtained on admission could help to identify high-risk individuals. The CURB65 score was developed to predict mortality risk in community acquired pneumonia. A retrospective study found that this score was also associated with mortality in COPD exacerbations. We conducted a prospective study to assess the utility of the CURB65 score in acute COPD exacerbations. Consecutive patients with physician diagnosed COPD exacerbations admitted to a public hospital during a 1-year period were studied prospectively. The CURB65 scores were calculated from information obtained at initial hospital presentation. CURB65 = one point each for Confusion, Urea > 7 mmol/L, Respiratory rate ≥ 30/min, low Blood pressure, age ≥ 65 years. 30-day mortality data were available for 249 of 252 patients. CURB65 scores on admission significantly predicted risk of death during the hospital admission and at 30 days. The 30-day mortality by score groups were: low risk (scores 0-1) 2.0% (2/98), moderate risk (score 2) 6.7% (6/90) and high risk (scores 3-5) 21.3% (13/61). CURB65 scores were not predictive of 1-year mortality. A simple 6-point score based on confusion, blood urea, respiratory rate, blood pressure and age can be used to stratify patients with COPD exacerbation into different management groups. The CURB65 score was as effective in predicting early mortality in our cohort of acute COPD exacerbations as it was in previous cohorts with community acquired pneumonia. Our findings suggest that CURB65 scores can help clinicians to assess patients with exacerbation of COPD.

The performance of CURB65 in predicting mortality in community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) has been tested in two large observational studies. However, it has not been tested against generic sepsis and early warning scores, which are increasingly being advocated for identification of high-risk patients in acute medical wards. A retrospective analysis was performed of data prospectively collected for a CAP quality improvement study. The ability to stratify mortality and performance characteristics (sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value, negative predictive value and area under the receiver operating curve) were calculated for stratifications of CURB65, CRB65, the systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS) criteria and the standardised early warning score (SEWS). 419 patients were included in the main analysis with a median age of 74 years (men = 47%). CURB65 and CRB65 stratified mortality in a more clinically useful way and had more favourable operating characteristics than SIRS or SEWS; for example, mortality in low-risk patients was 2% when defined by CURB65, but 9% when defined by SEWS and 11-17% when defined by variations of the SIRS criteria. The sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value and negative predictive value of CURB65 was 71%, 69%, 35% and 91%, respectively, compared with 62%, 73%, 35% and 89% for the best performing version of SIRS and 52%, 67%, 27% and 86% for SEWS. CURB65 had the greatest area under the receiver operating curve (0.78 v 0.73 for CRB65, 0.68 for SIRS and 0.64 for SEWS). CURB65 should not be supplanted by SIRS or SEWS for initial prognostic assessment in CAP. Further research to identify better generic prognostic tools is required.

(i) evaluate the performance of MR-pro-ADM in reflecting the outcome and risk for CAP patients in the emergency department, and (ii) compare the prognostic performance of MR-pro-ADM with that of clinical scores PSI and CURB65. Observational prospective, single-center study in patients with suspected community acquired pneumonia (CAP). Eighty one patients underwent full clinical and laboratory assessment as by protocol, and were followed up a 28 days. Primary endpoints measured were: death, death at 14 days, non-invasive mechanical ventilation (NIMV), endotracheal intubation (EI), ICU admission, overall hospital stay >10 days, emergency department stay >4 days. The discriminative performance of MR-pro-ADM and clinical scores was assessed by AUROC analysis. The distribution for MR-pro-ADM followed an upward trend, increasing with the increase of both PSI (p<0.001) and CURB65 (p<0.001) classes. However, the difference between MRproADM values and score classes was significant only in the case of CURB65 classes 0 and 1 (p = 0.046), 2 (p = 0.013), and 3 (p = 0.011); and with PSI classes 5, 3 (p = 0.044), and 1 (p = 0.020). As to the differences among variables for the six end-points, MR-pro-ADM values in the two groups selected for each considered end-point differed in a statistically significant manner for all endpoints. Both PSI and CURB65 differed significantly for all end-points, except for stay in the ED longer than 4 days and the hospital stay longer than 10 days and endotracheal intubation (only PSI classes differed with statistical significance). ROC analyses evidenced that MR-pro-ADM values gave the greatest AUC for the prediction of death, endotracheal intubation, hospital stay >10 days and DE stay >4 days, compared to the PSI and CURB (though difference not statistically significant). For each endpoint measured, the best thresholds values for Mr-pro-ADM were: 1.6 (specificity 76.5%; sensitivity 77.8%) for death; 2.5 (specificity 88.9%; sensitivity 80.0%) for death at 14 days; 1.5 (specificity 77.0%; sensitivity 87.5%) for NIMV; 2.4 (specificity 88.7%; sensitivity 83.3%) for endotracheal intubation; 0.9 (specificity 53.5%; sensitivity 70.6%) for DE stay greater than 4 days; 1.9 (specificity 82.1%; sensitivity 55.3%) for hospital stay greater than 10 days. The AUC for the combination of MR-pro-ADM and PSI was 81.29% [63.41%-99.17%], but not in a statistically significant manner compared to the AUCs of the single predictors. Conversely, the AUC for the combination of MR-pro-ADM and CURB65 was 87.58% [75.54%-99.62%], which was significantly greater than the AUC of CURB65 (p = 0.047) or PSI (p = 0.017) alone. The present study confirms that assessment of MR-pro-ADM levels in CAP patients in addition to CURB scores increases the prognostic accuracy of CURB alone and may help rule out discrepancies arising from flawed clinical severity classification. With particular reference to patients scoring in the upper classes of CURB and PSI, MR-pro-ADM values provided additional information towards a better risk stratification of those patients. In particular, our results pointed towards two MR-pro-ADM threshold values that appear to predict with a good degree of accuracy the patient's need for non-invasive mechanical ventilation, endotracheal intubation, or intensive care. This aspect, however, deserves further investigation.

Proadrenomedullin (ProADM) confers additional prognostic information to established clinical risk scores in lower respiratory tract infections (LRTI). We aimed to derive a practical algorithm combining the CURB65 score with ProADM-levels in patients with community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) and non-CAP-LRTI. We used data of 1359 patients with LRTI enrolled in a multicenter study. We chose two ProADM cut-off values by assessing the association between ProADM levels and the risk of adverse events and mortality. A composite score (CURB65-A) was created combining CURB65 classes with ProADM cut-offs to further risk-stratify patients. CURB65 and ProADM predicted both adverse events and mortality similarly well in CAP and non-CAP-LRTI. The combined CURB65-A risk score provided better prediction of death and adverse events than the CURB65 score in the entire cohort and in CAP and non-CAP-LRTI patients. Within each CURB65 class, higher ProADM-levels were associated with an increased risk of adverse events and mortality. Overall, risk of adverse events (3.9%) and mortality (0.65%) was low for patients with CURB65 score 0-1 and ProADM ≤0.75 nmol/l (CURB65-A risk class I); intermediate (8.6% and 2.6%, respectively) for patients with CURB65 score of 2 and ProADM ≤1.5 nmol/l or CURB classes 0-1 and ProADM levels between 0.75-1.5 nmol/L (CURB65-A risk class II), and high (21.6% and 9.8%, respectively) for all other patients (CURB65-A risk class III). If outpatient treatment was recommended for CURB65-A risk class I and short hospitalization for CURB65-A risk class II, 17.9% and 40.8% of 1217 hospitalized patients could have received ambulatory treatment or a short hospitalization, respectively. The new CURB65-A risk score combining CURB65 risk classes with ProADM cut-off values accurately predicts adverse events and mortality in patients with CAP and non-CAP-LRTI. Additional prospective cohort or intervention studies need to validate this score and demonstrate its safety and efficacy for the management of patients with LRTI.

CD14 is one of the leukocyte differentiation antigens, and is present in macrophages, monocytes, granulocytes and their cell membranes. Presepsin, namely soluble CD14-subtype (sCD14-ST) is produced by circulating plasma proteases activating cleavage of soluble CD14 (sCD14). The aim of this study is to investigate the role of Presepsin and the CURB65 scoring system in the evaluation of severity and outcome of CAP in an ED. A prospective, observational study was performed in an ED of an university teaching hospital from November 2011 to October 2012. A total of 359 patients with CAP and 214 patients with severe CAP (SCAP) were consecutively enrolled. Plasma Presepsin, lactate, serum PCT levels and leukocyte counts were measured and CURB65 score were calculated at admission enrollment. Plasma Presepsin levels were significantly higher in SCAP patients than in CAP patients (P < 0.0001), increasing correspondingly with the enhancement of CURB65 score. Patients with ARDS or DIC had obviously higher plasma Presepsin levels than those without ARDS or DIC (all P < 0.0001), and plasma Presepsin levels were significantly higher in non-survivors than in survivors at 28-day follow-up. In logistic regression analysis, CURB65 score was the independent predictor of ARDS, and Presepsin was the independent predictor of DIC, and Presepsin and CURB65 score were both the independent predictors of 28-day mortality. The AUCs showed Presepsin in combination with CURB65 score in predicting ARDS, SCAP and 28-day mortality was superior to Presepsin or CURB65 score alone ( all P < 0.01), Presepsin was better than CURB65 score and leukocyte in predicting DIC ( P < 0.01). Presepsin is a valuable biomarker in predicting severity and outcome in CAP patients in the ED and Presepsin in combination with CURB65 score significantly enhanced the predictive accuracy.

Community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) is a common cause of morbidity and mortality in adults worldwide, but its epidemiology varies markedly by region. Whilst in high-income countries, the predominant burden of CAP is in the elderly and those with chronic cardiovascular and pulmonary co-morbidity, CAP patients in low-income settings are often of working age and, in sub-Saharan Africa, frequently HIV-positive. Although region-specific aetiological data are limited, they are sufficient to highlight major trends: in high-burden settings, tuberculosis (TB) is a common cause of acute CAP; Gram-negative pathogens such as Klebsiella pneumoniae are regionally important; and HIV-associated opportunistic infections are common but difficult to diagnose. These differences in epidemiology and aetiological profile suggest that modified approaches to diagnosis, severity assessment and empirical antimicrobial therapy of CAP are necessary, but tailored individualized management approaches are constrained by limitations in the availability of radiological and laboratory diagnostic services, as well as medical expertise. The widespread introduction of the Xpert MTB/RIF platform represents a major advance for TB diagnosis, but innovations in rapid diagnostics for other opportunistic pathogens are urgently needed. Severity assessment tools (e.g. CURB65) that are used to guide early management decisions in CAP have not been widely validated in low-income settings and locally adapted tools are required. The optimal approach to initial antimicrobial therapy choices such as the need to provide early empirical cover for atypical bacteria and TB remain poorly defined. Improvements in supportive care such as correcting hypoxaemia and intravenous fluid management represent opportunities for substantial reductions in mortality.

We evaluated the predictive value of serum biomarkers and various clinical risk scales for the 28-day mortality of community-acquired pneumonia (CAP). Serum biomarkers including procalcitonin (PCT) and C-reactive protein (CRP) were evaluated in the emergency department. Scores for the pneumonia severity index (PSI); CURB65 (confusion, urea, respiration, blood pressure; age >65 years); Infectious Disease Society of America (IDSA) and American Thoracic Society (ATS) guidelines for severe CAP; Acute Physiology, Chronic Health Evaluation (APACHE) II; Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (SOFA); and quick SOFA (qSOFA) were calculated. Receiver-operating characteristic curves for 28-day mortality were calculated for each predictor using cut-off values, and we applied logistic regression models and area under the curve (AUC) analysis to compare the performance of predictors. Of the 125 enrolled patients, 13 died within 28 days. The AUCs of the PCT and CRP were 0.83 and 0.77, respectively. Using a PCT level >5.6 μg/L as the cut-off, the sensitivity and specificity for mortality were 76.9% and 90.2%, respectively. The three pneumonia severity scales showed an AUC of 0.86 (PSI), 0.87 (IDSA/ATS) and 0.77 (CURB65). The AUCs of the APACHE II, SOFA and qSOFA scores were 0.85, 0.83 and 0.81, respectively. The models combining CRP and/or PCT with PSI or the IDSA/ATS guidelines demonstrated superior performance to those of either PSI or the IDAS/ATS guidelines alone. In conclusion, serum PCT is a reliable single predictor for short-term mortality. Inclusion of CRP and/or PCT could significantly improve the performance of the PSI and IDAS/ATS guidelines.

An intervention trial found a trend for shorter length of stay (LOS) in patients with community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) when the CURB65 score was combined with the prognostic biomarker proadrenomedullin (ProADM) (CURB65-A). However, the efficacy and safety of CURB65-A in real life situations remains unclear. From September, 2011, until April, 2012, we performed a post-study prospective observational quality control survey at the cantonal Hospital of Aarau, Switzerland of consecutive adults with CAP. The primary endpoint was length of stay (LOS) during the index hospitalization and within 30 days. We compared the results with two well-defined historic cohorts of CAP patients hospitalized in the same hospital with the use of multivariate regression, namely 83 patients in the observation study without ProADM (OPTIMA I) and the 169 patients in the intervention study (OPTIMA II RCT). A total of 89 patients with confirmed CAP were included. As compared to patients with CURB65 only observed in the OPTIMA I study, adjusted regression analysis showed a significant shorter initial LOS (7.5 vs. 10.4 days; -2.32; 95% CI, -4.51 to -0.13; p = 0.04) when CURB65-A was used in clinical routine. No significant differences were found for LOS within 30 days. There were no significant differences in safety outcomes in regard to mortality and ICU admission between the cohorts. This post-study survey provides evidence that the use of ProADM in combination with CURB65 (CURB65-A) in "real life" situations reduces initial LOS compared to the CURB65 score alone without apparent negative effects on patient safety.
