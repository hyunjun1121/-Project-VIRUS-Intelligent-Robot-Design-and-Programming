Tick-borne encephalitis virus (TBEV) is the most important arboviral agent causing disease of the central nervous system in central Europe. In this study, 61 TBEV E gene sequences derived from 48 isolates from the Czech Republic, and four isolates and nine TBEV strains detected in ticks from Germany, covering more than half a century from 1954 to 2009, were sequenced and subjected to phylogenetic and Bayesian phylodynamic analysis to determine the phylogeography of TBEV in central Europe. The general Eurasian continental east-to-west pattern of the spread of TBEV was confirmed at the regional level but is interlaced with spreading that arises because of local geography and anthropogenic influence. This spread is reflected by the disease pattern in the Czech Republic that has been observed since 1991. The overall evolutionary rate was estimated to be approximately 8×10(-4) substitutions per nucleotide per year. The analysis of the TBEV E genes of 11 strains isolated at one natural focus in žďár Kaplice proved for the first time that TBEV is indeed subject to local evolution.

Since the recognition that louping-ill, known for well over 100 years as an epizootic disease of sheep in Scotland, was caused by a virus transmitted by arthropods, many other arthropod-borne viruses capable of causing encephalitis in domestic animals or man have been discovered. The author reviews here the knowledge at present available on these viruses, originally termed "arthropod-borne encephalitides viruses" but now often referred to as "arbor viruses".In this discussion of the host and vector relationships of the two broad groups of arbor viruses - the mosquito-borne and the tick-borne-and of the distribution, epidemiology and control of the various diseases they cause, the author includes an outline of the types of investigation likely to provide the most useful information, stressing in this connexion the value of ecological surveys.

The epidemiology of louping-ill in red grouse was studied in northern Britain concentrating on the possible role of other species and mechanisms of disease persistence. This tick borne viral disease caused heavy mortality in red grouse, particularly chicks. Louping-ill induced mortality reduced the strength of the density dependence that generates the tendency of grouse populations to cycle and in some populations may cause population sinks. Four routes of transmission were examined and non-viraemic transmission of virus between ticks cofeeding on hares was considered significant. Field data supported the hypothesis that disease dynamics is influenced greatly by mountain hares, both as passive amplifiers and as hosts for the tick vector. Genetic variation in louping-ill within Britain was small.

Tick-borne encephalitis virus (TBEV) is a flavivirus with major impact on global health. The geographical TBEV distribution is expanding, thus making it pivotal to further characterize the natural virus populations. In this study, we completed the earlier partial sequencing of a TBEV pulled out of a pool of RNA extracted from 115 ticks collected on Torö in the Stockholm archipelago. The total RNA was sufficient for all sequencing of a TBEV genome (Torö-2003), without conventional enrichment procedures such as cell culturing or suckling mice amplification. To our knowledge, this is the first time that the genome of TBEV has been sequenced directly from an arthropod reservoir. The Torö-2003 sequence has been characterized and compared with other TBE viruses. In silico analyses of secondary RNA structures formed by the two untranslated regions revealed a temperature-sensitive structural shift between a closed replicative form and an open AUG accessible form, analogous to a recently described bacterial thermoswitch. Additionally, novel phylogenetic conserved structures were identified in the variable part of the 3'-untranslated region, and their sequence and structure similarity when compared with earlier identified structures suggests an enhancing function on virus replication and translation. We propose that the thermo-switch mechanism may explain the low TBEV prevalence often observed in environmentally sampled ticks. Finally, we were able to detect variations that help in the understanding of virus adaptations to varied environmental temperatures and mammalian hosts through a comparative approach that compares RNA folding dynamics between strains with different mammalian cell passage histories.

A comparative study of the foci of tick-borne encephalitis (TBE) has revealed that the infectivity of vectors taiga ticks (Ixodes persulcatus) plays the leading role in the formation of foci with the highest epidemic activity (including forest steppe ones). The morbidity rates in each regional focus are directly related to the number of tick-bitten persons and to the quantity of the vector.

Many vector-borne pathogens whose primary vectors are generalists, such as Ixodid ticks, can infect a wide range of host species and are often zoonotic. Understanding their transmission dynamics is important for the development of disease management programmes. Models exist to describe the transmission dynamics of such diseases, but are necessarily simplistic and generally limited by knowledge of vector population dynamics. They are typically deterministic SIR-type models, which predict disease dynamics in a single, non-spatial, closed patch. Here we explore the limitations of such a model of louping-ill virus dynamics by challenging it with novel field data. The model was only partially successful in predicting Ixodes ricinus density and louping-ill virus prevalence at 6 Scottish sites. We extend the existing multi-host model by forming a two-patch model, incorporating the impact of roaming hosts. This demonstrates that host movement may account for some of the discrepancies between the original model and empirical data. We conclude that insights into the dynamics of multi-host vector-borne pathogens can be gained by using a simple two-patch model. Potential improvements to the model, incorporating aspects of spatial and temporal heterogeneity, are outlined.

In July 2008, owners of seasonal camps in Vermont and Maine were exposed to large numbers of questing ticks after opening their camps for the season. Examination of collected specimens revealed that the camp in Vermont was infested with Ixodes cookei Packard, and the camp in Maine was infested with Ixodes marxi Banks. In both instances, numerous tick bites were reported by residents. Both camps were also occupied by wildlife during the off-season, primarily squirrels (Maine) and skunks (Vermont). Subsequent samples from the Vermont site were tested for the presence of Powassan encephalitis virus, though no viral activity was detected.

Repeated predictions that vector-borne disease prevalence will increase with global warming are usually based on univariate models. To accommodate the full range of constraints, the present-day distribution of tick-borne encephalitis virus (TBEv) was matched statistically to current climatic variables, to provide a multivariate description of present-day areas of disease risk. This was then applied to outputs of a general circulation model that predicts how climatic variables may change in the future, and future distributions of TBEv were predicted for them. The expected summer rise in temperature and decrease in moisture appears to drive the distribution of TBEv into higher-latitude and higher-altitude regions progressively through the 2020s, 2050s and 2080s. The final toe-hold in the 2080s may be confined to a small part of Scandinavia, including new foci in southern Finland. The reason for this apparent contraction of the range of TBEv is that its transmission cycles depend on a particular pattern of tick seasonal dynamics, which may be disrupted by climate change. The observed marked increase in incidence of tick-borne encephalitis in most parts of Europe since 1993 may be due to non-biological causes, such as political and sociological changes.

For pathogens transmitted by biting vectors, one of the fundamental assumptions is often that vector bites are the sole or main route of host infection. Here, we demonstrate experimentally a transmission route whereby hosts (red grouse, Lagopus lagopus scoticus) became infected with a member of the tick-borne encephalitis virus complex, louping ill virus, after eating the infected tick vector. Furthermore, we estimated from field observations that this mode of infection could account for 73-98% of all virus infections in wild red grouse in their first season. This has potential implications for the understanding of other biting vector-borne pathogens where hosts may ingest vectors through foraging or grooming.

The infectivity of flavivirus particles depends on a maturation process that is triggered by the proteolytic cleavage of the precursor of the M protein (prM). This activation cleavage is naturally performed by ubiquitous cellular proteases of the furin family, which typically recognize the multibasic sequence motif R-X-R/K-R. Previously, we demonstrated that a tick-borne encephalitis virus (TBEV) mutant with an altered cleavage motif, R-X-R, produced immature, noninfectious particles that could be activated by exogenous trypsin, which cleaves after single basic residues. Here, we report the adaptation of this mutant to chymotrypsin, a protease specific for large, hydrophobic amino acid residues. Using selection pressure in cell culture, two different mutations conferring a chymotrypsin-dependent phenotype were identified. Surprisingly, one of these mutations (Ser85Phe) occurred three positions upstream of the natural cleavage site. The other mutation (Arg89His) arose at the natural cleavage position but involved a His residue, which is not a typical chymotrypsin cleavage site. Efficient cleavage of protein prM and activation by the heterologous protease were confirmed using various recombinant TBEV mutants. Mutants with only the originally selected mutations exhibited unimpaired export kinetics and were genotypically stable during at least six cell culture passages. However, in contrast to the wild-type virus or trypsin-dependent mutants, chymotrypsin-dependent mutants were not neurovirulent in suckling mice. Our results demonstrate that flaviviruses with altered protease specificities can be generated and suggest that this approach can be used for the construction of viral mutants or vectors that can be activated on demand and have restricted tissue tropism and virulence.

A single-chain antibody fragment that identifies a neutralizing epitope on the envelope protein of louping ill and some other tick-borne flaviviruses was previously expressed in soluble form from bacteria and shown to be functionally active in vitro. To see whether or not the single-chain antibody could bind and inactivate infectious virus in vivo, we have used recombinant Sindbis virus as a delivery vehicle for intracellular expression of the antibody fragment. The variable genes and interchain linker encoding the single-chain antibody were cloned into a double subgenomic Sindbis virus expression vector to generate recombinant Sindbis virus. Infection with this recombinant Sindbis virus provided high-level cytoplasmic expression of the antibody fragment in mammalian cells. We demonstrate (i) that the antibody fragment was antigen binding and (ii) that louping ill virus infectivity was significantly reduced in the presence of intracellular antibody expressed by the superinfecting recombinant Sindbis virus.

The complex pathogen-host-vector system of the tick-borne louping-ill virus causes economic losses to sheep and red grouse in upland United Kingdom. This paper examines the spatial distribution, incidence and effect of control measures on louping-ill virus in the Bowland Fells of Lancashire. Seroprevalence in sheep at the beginning of the study varied within the area and was affected significantly by the frequency of acaricide treatment. There was a clear decrease over 5 years in the effective force of infection on farms implementing a vaccination programme, irrespective of acaricide treatment regime, however, only one third of farms apparently eliminated infection. On farms where vaccination did not occur or where vaccination was carried out intermittently, the estimated force of infection was variable or possibly increased. Thus, as befits a complex host-pathogen system, reductions in prevalence were not as dramatic as predicted; we discuss the potential explanations for these observations.

The family Flaviviridae includes important human pathogens, such as dengue (DEN) virus, yellow fever (YF) virus and hepatitis C virus, many of which have emerged or re-emerged in recent years. Until recently, flavivirus evolution was thought to proceed in a clonal manner, with diversity generated mainly through the accumulation of mutational changes. However, this assumption has now been shown to be invalid, with homologous recombination demonstrated in all three genera of the FLAVIVIRIDAE: Since recombination has important implications for the study of virus evolution, a survey of recombination in the viruses of the genus Flavivirus was carried out. Using envelope gene sequence data and a combination of graphical and phylogenetic analyses, hitherto unreported recombination in Japanese encephalitis virus and St Louis encephalitis virus was detected, as well as further recombinants in DEN virus. However, no evidence for recombination was found in West Nile or YF viruses, or in the tick-borne flavivirus group. It is proposed that the difference between the mosquito- and tick-borne viruses can be accounted for by their differing modes of transmission, whilst the variation among the mosquito-borne flaviviruses reflects both the ecology of the particular host and vector species and also bias in the sampling process.

Tick-borne flaviviruses are maintained in nature in an enzootic cycle involving a tick vector and a vertebrate host. Thus, the virus replicates in two disparate hosts, each providing selective pressures that can influence virus replication and pathogenicity. To identify viral determinants associated with replication in the individual hosts, plaque purified Langat virus (TP21pp) was adapted to growth in mouse or tick cell lines to generate two virus variants, MNBp20 and ISEp20, respectively. Virus adaptation to mouse cells resulted in four amino acid changes in MNBp20 relative to TP21pp, occurring in E, NS4A and NS4B. A comparison between TP21pp and ISEp20 revealed three amino acid modifications in M, NS3 and NS4A of ISEp20. ISEp20, but not MNBp20, was attenuated following intraperitoneal inoculation of mice. Following isolation from mice brains, additional mutations reproducibly emerged in E and NS3 of ISEp20 that were possibly compensatory for the initial adaptation to tick cells. Thus, our data implicate a role for E, M, NS3, NS4A and NS4B in host adaptation and pathogenicity of tick-borne flaviviruses.

The impact of climate change on vector-borne infectious diseases is currently controversial. In Europe the primary arthropod vectors of zoonotic diseases are ticks, which transmit Borrelia burgdorferi sensu lato (the agent of Lyme disease), tick-borne encephalitis virus and louping ill virus between humans, livestock and wildlife. Ixodes ricinus ticks and reported tick-borne disease cases are currently increasing in the UK. Theories for this include climate change and increasing host abundance. This study aimed to test how I. ricinus tick abundance might be influenced by climate change in Scotland by using altitudinal gradients as a proxy, while also taking into account the effects of hosts, vegetation and weather effects. It was predicted that tick abundance would be higher at lower altitudes (i.e. warmer climates) and increase with host abundance. Surveys were conducted on nine hills in Scotland, all of open moorland habitat. Tick abundance was positively associated with deer abundance, but even after taking this into account, there was a strong negative association of ticks with altitude. This was probably a real climate effect, with temperature (and humidity, i.e. saturation deficit) most likely playing an important role. It could be inferred that ticks may become more abundant at higher altitudes in response to climate warming. This has potential implications for pathogen prevalence such as louping ill virus if tick numbers increase at elevations where competent transmission hosts (red grouse Lagopus lagopus scoticus and mountain hares Lepus timidus) occur in higher numbers.

We undertook a comparative study of the susceptibility of different tick cell lines to infection with the European subtype of tick-borne encephalitis virus (TBEV), prototype strain Neudoerfl. The growth of TBEV was investigated in lines derived from vector Ixodes ricinus L. ticks (IRE/CTVM18, 19, and 20), as well as non-vector ticks, namely Ixodes scapularis Say (IDE2), Boophilus microplus Canestrini (BME/CTVM2), Hyalomma anatolicum anatolicum Koch (HAE/CTVM9), Rhipicephalus appendiculatus Neumann (RA-257) and recently established and herein described lines from the argasid tick Ornithodoros moubata Murray (OME/CTVM21 and 22). All the tick cell lines tested were susceptible to infection by TBEV and the virus caused productive infection without any cytopathic effect. However, there was a clear difference between the TBEV growth in vector and non-vector cell lines, since I. ricinus cell lines produced 100-1000-fold higher virus yield than the non-vector cell lines. The lowest virus production was observed in O. moubata and R. appendiculatus cell lines.

The tick-borne encephalitis (TBE) serocomplex of viruses, genus Flavivirus, includes a number of important human pathogens that cause serious neurological illnesses and hemorrhagic fevers. These viruses pose a significant public health problem due to high rates of morbidity and mortality, their emergence to new geographic areas, and the recent rise in the incidence of human infections. The most notable member of the TBE serocomplex is tick-borne encephalitis virus (TBEV), a neurotropic flavivirus that causes debilitating and sometimes fatal encephalitis. Although effective prophylactic anti-TBEV vaccines have been developed, there is currently no specific treatment for infection. To identify new targets for therapeutical intervention, it is imperative to understand interactions between TBEV and the host immune response to infection. Interferon (IFN) has a critical role in controlling flavivirus replication. Dendritic cells (DCs) represent an early target of TBEV infection and are major producers of IFN. Thus, interactions between DCs, IFN responses, and the virus are likely to substantially influence the outcome of infection. Early IFN and DC responses are modulated not only by the virus, but also by the tick vector and immunomodulatory compounds of tick saliva inoculated with virus into the skin. Our laboratory is examining interactions between the triad of virus, tick vector, and mammalian host that contribute to the pathogenesis of tick-borne flaviviruses. This work will provide a more detailed understanding of early events in virus infection and their impact on flavivirus pathogenesis.

Ixodes ricinus, a competent vector of several pathogens, is the tick species most frequently reported to bite humans in Europe. The majority of human cases of Lyme borreliosis (LB) and tick-borne encephalitis (TBE) occur in the north-eastern region of Italy. The aims of this study were to detect the occurrence of endemic and emergent pathogens in north-eastern Italy using adult tick screening, and to identify areas at risk of pathogen transmission. Based on our results, different strategies for tick collection and pathogen screening and their relative costs were evaluated and discussed. From 2006 to 2008 adult ticks were collected in 31 sites and molecularly screened for the detection of pathogens previously reported in the same area (i.e., LB agents, TBE virus, Anaplasma phagocytophilum, Rickettsia spp., Babesia spp., "Candidatus Neoehrlichia mikurensis"). Based on the results of this survey, three sampling strategies were evaluated a-posteriori, and the impact of each strategy on the final results and the overall cost reductions were analyzed. The strategies were as follows: tick collection throughout the year and testing of female ticks only (strategy A); collection from April to June and testing of all adult ticks (strategy B); collection from April to June and testing of female ticks only (strategy C). Eleven pathogens were detected in 77 out of 193 ticks collected in 14 sites. The most common microorganisms detected were Borrelia burgdorferi sensu lato (17.6%), Rickettsia helvetica (13.1%), and "Ca. N. mikurensis" (10.5%). Within the B. burgdorferi complex, four genotypes (i.e., B. valaisiana, B. garinii, B. afzelii, and B. burgdorferi sensu stricto) were found. Less prevalent pathogens included R. monacensis (3.7%), TBE virus (2.1%), A. phagocytophilum (1.5%), Bartonella spp. (1%), and Babesia EU1 (0.5%). Co-infections by more than one pathogen were diagnosed in 22% of infected ticks. The prevalences of infection assessed using the three alternative strategies were in accordance with the initial results, with 13, 11, and 10 out of 14 sites showing occurrence of at least one pathogen, respectively. The strategies A, B, and C proposed herein would allow to reduce the original costs of sampling and laboratory analyses by one third, half, and two thirds, respectively. Strategy B was demonstrated to represent the most cost-effective choice, offering a substantial reduction of costs, as well as reliable results. Monitoring of tick-borne diseases is expensive, particularly in areas where several zoonotic pathogens co-occur. Cost-effectiveness studies can support the choice of the best monitoring strategy, which should take into account the ecology of the area under investigation, as well as the available budget.

This study has examined the efficacy following intramuscular administration of a recombinant Semliki Forest virus (rSFV) vaccine, encoding the prME and NS1 proteins of louping ill virus (LIV), in sheep. Administration of rSFV-LIV vaccine resulted in transient detection at the injection site and draining lymph node only and no dissemination to distal sites. In addition, the recombinant vaccine offered complete protection against subcutaneous challenge with LIV, and partial protection following intranasal administration of LIV. Protected animals had no pathological changes normally associated with LIV infection, and had developed high antibody titres. In contrast, the two animals not protected exhibited classical clinical signs and neuropathological lesions of LIV infection. These findings indicate that rSFV-based vaccines have the potential to be developed as effective prototype vaccines for LIV.

Tick-borne encephalitis virus (TBEV) and Louping ill virus (LIV) are viruses in the Mammalian tick-borne virus group/genus Flavivirus, causing central nervous system disease. Greek goat encephalitis virus (GGEV), which was isolated from the brain of a newborn goat with neurological symptoms, is currently classified in the TBEV group. The vector of GGEV has not yet been specifically identified but is considered likely to be Ixodes ricinus. A total of 3,144 Ixodidae ticks collected during 2003-2006 from goats and sheep in rural areas of Northern Greece were tested by reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) for the presence of TBEV-specific RNA. Two pools of I. ricinus ticks were shown to be RNA-positive. Sequence analysis showed that the virus was GGEV. The RNA-positive ticks were detected in regions where high prevalence of TBE antibodies in humans was present. Prevalence in ticks varied according to year, season, and geographic region. TBEV is not endemic in Greece, and most probably the seroprevalence of TBE antibodies in humans is due to cross-reactivity to GGEV.

Tick-borne encephalitis (TBE) is among the most important vector borne diseases of humans in Europe and is currently identified as a major health problem in many countries. TBE endemic zones have expanded over the past two decades, as well as the number of reported cases within endemic areas. Multiple factors are ascribed for the increased incidence of TBE, including climatic change. The number of TBE cases has also increased in Norway over the past decade, and the human cases cluster along the southern coast of Norway. In Norway the distribution and prevalence of TBE virus (TBEV) in tick populations is largely unknown. The objectives of this study were to estimate the TBEV prevalence in Ixodes ricinus from seven locations and to assess the relationship between the TBEV prevalence and site-specific climatic variables. A total of 5630 questing nymphs were collected and analyzed in pools of ten. All pools were screened with an in-house real-time RT-PCR, and the positive pools were pyrosequenced. Two methods, minimum infection rate (MIR) and a frequentist method (EPP) for pooled prevalence estimations were calculated and compared. Climatic data were descriptively compared to the corresponding EPP of each location in order to explain variations in TBEV prevalence. The seven foci of TBEV had an estimated overall prevalence (EPP) in pools of nymphs combined, of 0.53% with 95% CI (0.35-0.75), with point prevalence ranging between 0.11%-1.22%. The sites with the highest point prevalences were within the municipalities which had the highest numbers of registered TBE cases. The results indicate that the location with highest point prevalence had the highest relative mean humidity and lowest mean saturation deficit and vice versa for the lowest EPP. Our study confirms the existence of TBEV endemic foci in Norway. These results are of importance to increase the awareness of TBEV infections in Norway and could be used for public information and recommendations of TBE vaccination. EPP is the method of choice for pooled prevalence calculations, since it provides estimated prevalences with confidence intervals. Our findings emphasise the possible importance of microclimatic conditions regarding the TBEV prevalence in ticks.

This article describes the steps taken to verify that the tick Ixodes ricinus is the main vector of Slovenian meningo-encephalitis.In 1954, several unsuccessful attempts were made to isolate the virus from unengorged ticks collected at random, but in the following year this system was abandoned, and instead the search for specimens was carried out on the basis of evidence supplied by meningo-encephalitis patients with a tick-bite case history.In June-the peak endemic period-140 unengorged ticks were collected from a part of a forest in central Slovenia where one of these patients had been working. The ticks were washed in alcohol, finely ground, and centrifuged, and the supernatant was inoculated intracerebrally into suckling mice, and intraperitoneally into adult mice and guinea-pigs. The infected suckling mice died between the fourteenth and eighteenth day after inoculation; a suspension of their brains was inoculated intracerebrally into a further batch of suckling and adult mice, which subsequently fell ill, showing signs in the central nervous system.The virus strain obtained was subjected to neutralization and complement-fixation tests, in order to identify the infective agent.

Tick-Borne Encephalitis virus (TBEV) causes dangerous central nervous system diseases in humans. General infection leads to the development of meningitis or encephalitis, which is characterized by swelling of the brain due to inflammation. Tetracyclines may act locally to moderate inflammation in the CNS. In this study, we investigated the potential clinical benefits of administering tetracycline hydrochloride to patients hospitalized due to suspected TBEV infection presenting with fever and evidence of a recent tick bite. We also characterized an acute immune response to TBEV by profiling certain cytokines and soluble receptors in Tetracycline-treated and untreated patients. Increased serum levels of TNF-alpha, IL-1 alpha and IL-6 were found in all patients at admission. Soluble receptors presented in the serum of patients in a magnitude higher levels than the corresponding cytokines and were increasing during first weak of hospitalization. Levels of IL-10 were also rising during that period. In our study tetracycline hydrochloride acted as an immunomodulator, which was able to reduce manifestations of inflammation response during TBE course; this action led to quicker improvement of symptoms and, consequently, to a faster clinical recovery. The positive result of tetracycline hydrochloride treatment was accompanied by certain particularities in the dynamics of studied cytokines and receptors: the concentrations of IL-6, IL-1 beta, TNF-alpha dropped quicker and reached lower levels, and the concentrations of sIL-6R, IL-1RA, sTNFR1 increased faster and reached higher maximum levels in the tetracycline-treated groups. Children had the highest levels of IL-6, which were not neurotoxic.

Parasite-mediated apparent competition occurs when one species affects another through the action of a shared parasite. One way of controlling the parasite in the more susceptible host is to manage the reservoir host. Culling can cause issues in terms of ethics and biodiversity impacts, therefore we ask: can treating, as compared to culling, a wildlife host protect a target species from the shared parasite? We used Susceptible Infected Recovered (SIR) models parameterized for the tick-borne louping ill virus (LIV) system. Deer are the key hosts of the vector (Ixodes ricinus) that transmits LIV to red grouse Lagopus lagopus scoticus, causing high mortality. The model was run under scenarios of varying acaricide efficacy and deer densities. The model predicted that treating deer can increase grouse density through controlling ticks and LIV, if acaricide efficacies are high and deer densities low. Comparing deer treated with 70% acaricide efficacy with a 70% cull rate suggested that treatment may be more effective than culling if initial deer densities are high. Our results will help inform tick control policies, optimize the targeting of control methods and identify conditions where host management is most likely to succeed. Our approach is applicable to other host-vector-pathogen systems.

We have constructed recombinant baculoviruses and vaccinia viruses containing cloned DNA, encoding either the envelope protein alone or all of the structural proteins (core, membrane and envelope) of louping ill virus. Glycosylated viral envelope protein, presented both inside and on the surface of insect and mammalian cells, was expressed by all four recombinant viruses. Differences in antigenic presentation of the envelope protein were observed between the envelope protein and structural protein constructs as well as between the insect and mammalian cell expression systems. Despite the expression of epitopes known to elicit neutralizing and protective antibodies when present in authentic antigen, the recombinant envelope protein expressed by either vector failed to induce, in mice or rabbits, either neutralizing or protective antibodies against louping ill virus.

A total of 875 nymphal and adult Ixodes ricinus ticks and 148 adult Dermacentor reticulatus ticks were collected by flagging lower vegetation in the Lublin region (eastern Poland) and examined for the presence of RNA of tick-borne encephalitis virus (TBEV) by nested RT-PCR. The minimum infection rate of I. ricinus ticks with TBEV amounted to 1.6% while the infection rate of D. reticulatus ticks was 10.8%. The results suggest that D. reticulatus may be a potential vector of TBEV in Central Europe.
