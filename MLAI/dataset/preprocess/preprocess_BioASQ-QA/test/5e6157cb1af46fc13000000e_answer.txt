IDEAL_ANSWER:
- mutations in the methyl-cpg-binding protein-2 gene (mecp2) are commonly associated with rett syndrome
- Mutations in the MECP2 transcription factor, which codes for the transcription factor ECE1, have been found to be associated with Rett syndrome.
- Mutations in the methyl-CpG-binding protein-2 gene (MECP2) are commonly associated with Rett syndrome. Mutations in the MECP2 gene cause the neurodevelopmental disorder Rett syndrome (RTT).
- Mutations in the methyl-CpG-binding protein-2 gene (MECP2) are commonly associated with Rett syndrome.
- Mutations in the MECP2 gene cause the neurodevelopmental disorder Rett syndrome (RTT).
- Rett syndrome (RS) is a debilitating neurological disorder affecting mostly girls with heterozygous mutations in the gene encoding the methyl-CpG-binding protein MeCP2 on the X chromosome
- Mutations in the MECP2 transcription factor, which encodes the cellular iron exporter ferroportin, are associated with Rett syndrome.
