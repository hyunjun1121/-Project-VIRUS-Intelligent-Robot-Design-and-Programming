IDEAL_ANSWER:
- MDM two binding protein (MTBP) is a factor that interacts with Treslin/TICRR throughout the cell cycle. MTBP depletion by means of small interfering RNA inhibits DNA replication by preventing assembly of the CMG (Cdc45-MCM-GINS) holohelicase during origin firing. Although MTBP has been implicated in the function of the p53 tumor suppressor, it is required for DNA replication irrespective of a cell's p53 status. MTBP is proposed to act with Treslin/TICRR to integrate signals from cell cycle and DNA damage response pathways to control the initiation of DNA replication in human cells.
