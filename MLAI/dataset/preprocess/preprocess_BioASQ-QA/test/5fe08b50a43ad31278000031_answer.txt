IDEAL_ANSWER:
- The expression of genes both from the endogenous locus and from transgenes is strongly influenced by a linked 15-kilobase region of clustered DNaseI hypersensitive sites (HSs) known as the locus control region (LCR) Targeted deletion of 5'HS1 and 5â€™HS4 of the beta-globin locus Control region reveals additive activity of the sites . The LCR is composed of a series of 5 DNase . sites (5'HSs), that form in the nucleus of erythroid precursors .
- Mammalian beta-globin loci are composed of multiple orthologous genes whose expression is erythroid specific and developmentally regulated. The expression of these genes both from the endogenous locus and from transgenes is strongly influenced by a linked 15-kilobase region of clustered DNaseI hypersensitive sites (HSs) known as the locus control region (LCR). The LCR encompasses 5 major HSs, each of which is highly homologous among humans, mice, and other mammals. The LCR encompasses 6 DNaseI hypersensitive sites (HSs) that bind transcription factors.
- Mammalian beta-globin loci is composed of multiple orthologous genes whose expression is erythroid specific and developmentally regulated . Globin gene expression is regulated by a linked 15-kilobase region of clustered DNaseI hypersensitive sites (HSs) known as the locus control region (LCR) The LCR encompasses 5 major HSs, each of which is highly homologous among humans, mice, and other mammals .
- The expression of genes both from the endogenous locus and from transgenes is strongly influenced by a linked 15-kilobase region of clustered DNaseI hypersensitive sites (HSs) known as the locus control region (LCR) The LCR is composed of a series of 5 DNase . sites (5'HSs), that form in the nucleus of erythroid precursors . In the chromatin of the epsilon globin gene, four DNase. sites that are located 6-18kb 5' of the . epsilon, Ggamma, Agamma, delta, beta .
- Mammalian beta-globin expression is strongly influenced by a linked 15-kilobase region of clustered DNaseI hypersensitive sites (HSs) known as the locus control region (LCR). The LCR encompasses 5 major HSs, termed 5'HS1-5, located 6-22 Kb upstream of the epsilon-globin gene, each of which is highly homologous among humans, mice, and other mammals.
- Mammalian beta-globin loci are composed of multiple orthologous genes whose expression is erythroid specific and developmentally regulated. Globin gene expression is regulated, in part, by the locus control region, which physically consists of five DNaseI-hypersensitive sites located 6-22 Kb upstream of the epsilon -globin gene.
- In the chromatin of erythroid cells the locus control region is characterized by four DNaseI hypersensitive sites that are located 6-18kb 5' of the epsilon globin gene . Expression of the five beta-like globin genes (epsilon, Ggamma, Agamma, delta, beta) in the human beta-globin locus depends on enhancement by a linked 15-kilobase region .
