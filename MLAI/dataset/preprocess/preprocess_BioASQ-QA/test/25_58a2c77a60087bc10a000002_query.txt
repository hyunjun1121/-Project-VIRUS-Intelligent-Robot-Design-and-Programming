The E280A mutation of the presenilin 1 gene has been found to be the most common associate in Alzheimers patients with a family history of this disease. Presenilin 1 is a critical component of the g-secretase complex and plays an essential role in the production of amyloid-beta peptide. This peptide has been strongly associated with the physiopathology of the disease. The E280A mutation in the presenilin 1 was investigated for increased production of amyloid-beta , as a response to gain in gamma-secretase function. Levels of systemic amyloid-beta were measured with congo red staining and immuno-histochemistry of the tissues of affected cadavers, compared with non-affected cadavers. The 40 and 42 amino acid amyloid-beta levels were quantified by ELISA assay in CHO cell cultures. The amyloid precursor protein expressed by the cultures was detected by transfection with the cDNAs of presenilin 1 carrying the M146L, E280A, DE9 y L392V mutations. Protein deposits were found in all tissues investigatged, but only a few with beta -amyloid deposition. No differences were observed in the amount or location of amyloid-beta between affected and unaffected cadavers. Not increase was noted in the production of amyloid-beta from the CHO cells transfected with cDNA from any of the mutations of presenilin 1. The E280A mutation in the presenilin 1 gene was not associated with the increased production of amyloid-beta in non-neuronal peripheral tissues, or in the in vitro model. This is in contrast to the expectation in a gamma-secretase gain of function.

γ-Secretase is a multisubunit membrane protein complex containing presenilin (PS1) as a catalytic subunit. Familial Alzheimer disease (FAD) mutations within PS1 were analyzed in yeast cells artificially expressing membrane-bound substrate, amyloid precursor protein, or Notch fused to Gal4 transcriptional activator. The FAD mutations, L166P and G384A (Leu-166 to Pro and Gly-384 to Ala substitution, respectively), were loss-of-function in yeast. We identified five amino acid substitutions that suppress the FAD mutations. The cleavage of amyloid precursor protein or Notch was recovered by the secondary mutations. We also found that secondary mutations alone activated the γ-secretase activity. FAD mutants with suppressor mutations, L432M or S438P within TMD9 together with a missense mutation in the second or sixth loops, regained γ-secretase activity when introduced into presenilin null mouse fibroblasts. Notably, the cells with suppressor mutants produced a decreased amount of Aβ42, which is responsible for Alzheimer disease. These results indicate that the yeast system is useful to screen for mutations and chemicals that modulate γ-secretase activity.

Fused oxadiazines (3) were discovered as selective and orally bioavailable γ-secretase modulators (GSMs) based on the structural framework of oxadiazoline GSMs. Although structurally related, initial modifications showed that structure-activity relationships (SARs) did not translate from the oxadiazoline to the oxadiazine series. Subsequent SAR studies on modifications at the C3 and C4 positions of the fused oxadiazine core helped to identify GSMs such as compounds 8r and 8s that were highly efficacious in vitro and in vivo in a number of animal models with highly desirable physical and pharmacological properties. Further improvements of in vitro activity and selectivity were achieved by the preparation of fused morpholine oxadiazines. The shift in specificity of APP cleavage rather than a reduction in overall γ-secretase activity and the lack of changes in substrate accumulation and Notch processing as observed in the animal studies of compound 8s confirm that the oxadiazine series of compounds are potent GSMs.

The gamma-secretase complex is an intramembrane aspartyl protease that cleaves its substrates along their transmembrane regions. Sequential proteolytic processing of amyloid precursor protein by beta- and gamma-secretase produces amyloid beta-peptides, which are the major components of amyloid plaques in the brains of Alzheimer's disease patients. The gamma-secretase complex is therefore believed to be critical in the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease. Here we review the range of factors found to affect the nature and degree of gamma-secretase complex activity; these include gamma-secretase complex assembly and activation, the integral regulatory subunit CD147, transient or weak binding partners, the levels of cholesterol and sphingolipids in cell membranes, and inflammatory cytokines. Integrated knowledge of the molecular mechanisms supporting the actions of these factors is expected to lead to a comprehensive understanding of the functional regulation of the gamma-secretase complex, and this, in turn, should facilitate the development of novel therapeutic strategies for the treatment of Alzheimer's disease.

Gamma-secretase catalyzes the proteolytic processing of a number of integral membrane proteins, including amyloid precursor protein (APP) and Notch. The native gamma-secretase is a heterogeneous population of large membrane protein complexes containing presenilin 1 (PS1) or presenilin 2 (PS2), aph-1a or aph-1b, nicastrin, and pen-2. Here we report the reconstitution of a gamma-secretase complex in Sf9 cells by co-infection with baculoviruses carrying the PS1, nicastrin, pen-2, and aph-1a genes. The reconstituted enzyme processes C99 and the Notch-like substrate N160 and displays the characteristic features of gamma-secretase in terms of sensitivity to a gamma-secretase inhibitor, upregulation of Abeta42 production by a familial Alzheimer's disease (FAD) mutation in the APP gene, and downregulation of Notch processing by PS1 FAD mutations. However, the ratio of Abeta42:Abeta40 production by the reconstituted gamma-secretase is significantly higher than that of the native enzyme from 293 cells. Unlike in mammalian cells where PS1 FAD mutations cause an increase in Abeta42 production, PS1 FAD missense mutations in the reconstitution system alter the cleavage sites in the C99 substrate without changing the Abeta42:Abeta40 ratio. In addition, PS1DeltaE9 is a loss-of-function mutation in both C99 and N160 processing. Reconstitution of gamma-secretase provides a homogeneous system for studying the individual gamma-secretase complexes and their roles in Abeta production, Notch processing and AD pathogenesis. These studies may provide important insight into the development of a new generation of selective gamma-secretase inhibitors with an improved side effect profile.

The gamma-secretase complex plays a role in Alzheimer's disease and cancer progression. The development of clinically useful inhibitors, however, is complicated by the role of the gamma-secretase complex in regulated intramembrane proteolysis of Notch and other essential proteins. Different gamma-secretase complexes containing different Presenilin or Aph1 protein subunits are present in various tissues. Here we show that these complexes have heterogeneous biochemical and physiological properties. Specific inactivation of the Aph1B gamma-secretase in a mouse Alzheimer's disease model led to improvements of Alzheimer's disease-relevant phenotypic features without any Notch-related side effects. The Aph1B complex contributes to total gamma-secretase activity in the human brain, and thus specific targeting of Aph1B-containing gamma-secretase complexes may help generate less toxic therapies for Alzheimer's disease.

gamma-Secretase is critically involved in the Notch pathway and in Alzheimer's disease. The four subunits of gamma-secretase assemble in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and unassembled subunits are retained/retrieved to the ER by specific signals. We here describe a novel ER-retention/retrieval signal in the transmembrane domain (TMD) 4 of presenilin 1, a subunit of gamma-secretase. TMD4 also is essential for complex formation, conferring a dual role for this domain. Likewise, TMD1 of Pen2 is bifunctional as well. It carries an ER-retention/retrieval signal and is important for complex assembly by binding to TMD4. The two TMDs directly interact with each other and mask their respective ER-retention/retrieval signals, allowing surface transport of reporter proteins. Our data suggest a model how assembly of Pen2 into the nascent gamma-secretase complex could mask TMD-based ER-retention/retrieval signals to allow plasma membrane transport of fully assembled gamma-secretase.

Environmental factors are significant contributors for the development of Alzheimer's disease (AD). The greatly increased incidence of AD following stroke and cerebral ischemia suggests that hypoxia is a risk factor which may accelerate AD pathogenesis by altering amyloid precursor protein (APP) processing. However, the molecular mechanisms underlying the hypoxia mediated AD pathogenesis have not been fully elucidated. In the present study we demonstrated that repeated hypoxia increased beta-amyloid (Abeta) generation and neuritic plaques formation by elevating beta-cleavage of APP in APP(swe)+PS1(A246E) transgenic mice. We also found that hypoxia enhanced the expression of APH-1a, a component of gamma-secretase complex, which in turn may lead to increase in gamma-cleavage activity. Furthermore, we demonstrated that repeated hypoxia treatment can activate macroautophagy, which may contribute to the increases in Abeta production since pretreatment with macroautophagy inhibitor 3-methyladenine significantly blocked chemical hypoxic condition-induced increase in Abeta production in SH-SY5Y cells. Taken together, our results suggest an important role of hypoxia in modulating the APP processing by facilitating both beta- and gamma-cleavage which may result in a significant increase of Abeta generation.

The γ-secretase complex is a promising target in Alzheimer's disease because of its role in the amyloidogenic processing of β-amyloid precursor protein. This enzyme also catalyzes the cleavage of Notch receptor, resulting in the nuclear translocation of intracellular Notch where it modulates gene transcription. Notch signaling is essential in cell fate decisions during embryogenesis, neuronal differentiation, hematopoiesis, and development of T and B cells, including splenic marginal zone (MZ) B cells. This B cell compartment participates in the early phases of the immune response to blood-borne bacteria and viruses. Chronic treatment with the oral γ-secretase inhibitor RO4929097 resulted in dose-dependent decreased cellularity (atrophy) of the MZ of rats and mice. Significant decreases in relative MZ B-cell numbers of RO4929097-treated animals were confirmed by flow cytometry. Numbers of MZ B cells reverted to normal after a sufficient RO4929097-free recovery period. Functional characterization of the immune response in relation to RO4929097-related MZ B cell decrease was assessed in mice vaccinated with inactivated vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV). Compared with the immunosuppressant cyclosporin A, RO4929097 caused only mild and reversible delayed early neutralizing IgM and IgG responses to VSV. Thus, the functional consequence of MZ B cell decrease on host defense is comparatively mild.

Presenilins are the catalytic subunit of the large gamma-secretase complex, that promotes intramembranous proteolysis of the beta-amyloid precursor protein (APP), resulting in the production of beta-amyloid (A beta). Mutant presenilin causes early-onset familial Alzheimer's disease (FAD), is related to abnormal Ca(2+) signaling, and render cells vulnerable to cell death. In the present study, we demonstrated that Ca(2+)-mediated cell death is functionally associated with gamma-secretase activity. We found that gamma-secretase activity was elevated during Ca(2+)-mediated cell death. Using selective gamma-secretase inhibitors, we examined the role of gamma-secretase in cell death triggered by increased intracellular Ca(2+). Indeed, treatment with the selective gamma-secretase inhibitors, compound E, DAPT, or L-685.458 significantly decreased Ca(2+)-triggered cell death with that of the controls, but did not affect staurosporin or tunicamycin-mediated cell death. These results implicate the role of gamma-secretase activity in Ca(2+)-mediated cell death.

Genetic and biological studies provide evidence that the production and deposition of amyloid-beta peptides (Abeta) contribute to the etiology of Alzheimer's disease. beta- and gamma-secretases, which are responsible for the generation of Abeta, are plausible molecular targets for Alzheimer's disease treatment. gamma-Secretase is an unusual aspartic protease that cleaves the scissile bond within the transmembrane domain. This unusual enzyme is composed of a high molecular weight membrane protein complex containing presenilin, nicastrin, Aph-1 and Pen-2. Drugs that regulate the production of Abeta by inhibiting or modulating gamma-secretase activity could provide a disease-modifying effect on Alzheimer's disease, although recent studies suggest that gamma-secretase plays important roles in cellular signaling including Notch. Thus, understanding the molecular mechanism whereby gamma-secretase recognizes and cleaves its substrate is a critical issue for the development of compounds that specifically regulate Abeta-generating gamma-secretase activity. This review focuses on the structure and function relationship of gamma-secretase complex and the mode of action of the gamma-secretase inhibitors.

gamma-Secretase is a protease complex, which catalyzes the final of two subsequent cleavages of the beta-amyloid precursor protein (APP) to release the amyloid-beta peptide (Abeta) implicated in Alzheimer's disease (AD) pathogenesis. In human cells, six gamma-secretase complexes exist, which are composed of either presenilin (PS) 1 or 2, the catalytic subunit, nicastrin, PEN-2, and either APH-1a (as S or L splice variants) or its homolog APH-1b. It is not known whether and how different APH-1 species contribute to the pathogenic activity of gamma-secretase complexes with familial AD (FAD)-associated mutant PS. Here we show that all known gamma-secretase complexes are active in APP processing and that all combinations of APH-1 variants with either FAD mutant PS1 or PS2 support pathogenic Abeta(42) production. Since our data suggest that pathogenic gamma-secretase activity cannot be attributed to a discrete gamma-secretase complex, we propose that all gamma-secretase complexes have to be explored and evaluated for their potential as AD drug target.

Genetic analysis of familial Alzheimer's disease has revealed that mutations in the gamma-secretase enzyme presenilin promote toxic Abeta secretion; however, presenilin mutations might also influence tau hyperphosphorylation and neurodegeneration through gamma-secretase-independent mechanisms. To address this possibility and determine whether other components of the gamma-secretase complex possess similar regulatory functions, we analyzed the roles of presenilin, nicastrin, and aph-1 in a Drosophila model for tau-induced neurodegeneration. Here, we show that presenilin and nicastrin prevent tau toxicity by modulating the PI3K/Akt/GSK3beta phosphorylation pathway, whereas aph-1 regulates aPKC/PAR-1 activities. Moreover, we found that these transmembrane proteins differentially regulate the intracellular localization of GSK3beta and aPKC at cell junctions. Inhibition of gamma-secretase activity neither interfered with these kinase pathways nor induced aberrant tau phosphorylation. These results establish new in vivo molecular functions for the three components of the gamma-secretase complex and reveal a different mechanism that might contribute to neuronal degeneration in Alzheimer's disease.

Cleavage of the beta-secretase processed beta-amyloid precursor protein by gamma-secretase leads to the extracellular release of Abeta42, the more amyloidogenic form of the beta-amyloid peptide, which subsequently forms the amyloid-plaques diagnostic of Alzheimer's disease. Mutations in beta-amyloid precursor protein (APP), presenilin-1 and presenilin-2 associated with familial Alzheimer's disease (FAD) increase release of Abeta42, suggesting that FAD may directly result from increased gamma-secretase activity. Here, we show that familial Alzheimer's disease mutations clustered near the sites of gamma-secretase cleavage actually decrease gamma-secretase-mediated release of the intracellular fragment of APP (CTFgamma). Concordantly, presenilin-1 mutations that result in Alzheimer's disease also decrease the release of CTFgamma. Mutagenesis of the epsilon cleavage site in APP mimicked the effects of the FAD mutations, both decreasing CTFgamma release and increasing Abeta42 production, suggesting that perturbation of this site may account for the observed decrement in gamma-secretase-mediated proteolysis of APP. As CTFgamma has been implicated in transcriptional activation, these data indicate that decreased signaling and transcriptional regulation resulting from FAD mutations in beta-amyloid precursor protein and presenilin-1 may contribute to the pathology of Alzheimer's disease.

Gamma-secretase-mediated processing of the amyloid-beta protein precursor (AbetaPP) is a crucial step in the formation of the amyloid-beta peptide (Abeta), but little is known about how the substrate AbetaPP interacts with the gamma-secretase complex. To understand the molecular events involved in gamma-secretase-mediated AbetaPP processing and Abeta formation, in the present study we determined the role of a well conserved GxxxG motif in the transmembrane domain of AbetaPP. Our data clearly demonstrate that substitution of aspartic acid for the key glycine residues in the GxxxG motif almost completely abolished the formation of Abeta. Furthermore, our data revealed that substitution of aspartic acid for the glycine in this GxxxG motif disrupts the interaction of AbetaPP with the gamma-secretase complex. Thus, the present study revealed an essential role for the GxxxG motif in the interaction of AbetaPP with the gamma-secretase complex and the formation of Abeta.

Gamma-secretase is a membrane protein complex with unusual aspartyl protease activity that cleaves a variety of type I transmembrane proteins, such as APP, Notch and E-cadherin, within their transmembranous regions. Gamma-secretase was first recognized because of its role in the production of Abeta peptides that are pathogenic in Alzheimer's disease. There is overwhelming evidence demonstrating that four components, presenilin, nicastrin, APH-1 and PEN-2, are necessary and sufficient for gamma-secretase activity. However, based on the findings of studies conducted on cells overexpressing these four components, the existence of regulatory components of the gamma-secretase complex has been postulated. Recently, an additional subunit of the gamma-secretase complex, membrane protein CD147, has been identified through the purification and characterization of endogenous complexes from HeLa cell membranes. Removal of CD147 from gamma-secretase complexes increases the production of Abeta-peptides. Elucidating the molecular mechanism by which CD147 exerts its effect on the activity of the gamma-secretase complex will help us to further understand the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease, and may allow for the development of novel therapeutics.

Mutations in presenilins (PS1 and PS2) account for the vast majority of early onset familial Alzheimer's disease cases. Beside the well investigated role of presenilins as the catalytic unit in γ-secretase complex, their involvement in regulation of intracellular calcium homeostasis has recently come into more focus of Alzheimer's disease research. Here we report that the overexpression of PS1 full-length holoprotein forms, in particular familial Alzheimer's disease-causing forms of PS1, result in significantly attenuated calcium release from thapsigargin- and bradykinin-sensitive stores. Interestingly, treatment of HEK293 cells with γ-secretase inhibitors also leads to decreased amount of calcium release from endoplasmic reticulum (ER) accompanying elevated PS1 holoprotein levels. Similarly, the knockdown of PEN-2 which is associated with deficient PS1 endoproteolysis and accumulation of its holoprotein form also leads to decreased ER calcium release. Notably, we detected enhanced PS1 holoprotein levels also in postmortem brains of patients carrying familial Alzheimer's disease PS1 mutations. Taken together, the conditions in which the amount of full length PS1 holoprotein is increased result in reduction of calcium release from ER. Based on these results, we propose that the disturbed ER calcium homeostasis mediated by the elevation of PS1 holoprotein levels may be a contributing factor to the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease.

In this review, we discuss the biology of gamma-secretase, an enigmatic enzyme complex that is responsible for the generation of the amyloid-beta peptide that constitutes the amyloid plaques of Alzheimer's disease. We begin with a brief review on the processing of the amyloid precursor protein and a brief discussion on the family of enzymes involved in regulated intramembrane proteolysis, of which gamma-secretase is a member. We then identify the four major components of the gamma-secretase complex - presenilin, nicastrin, Aph-1, and Pen-2 - with a focus on the identification of each and the role that each plays in the maturation and activity of the complex. We also discuss two new proteins that may play a role in modulating the assembly and activity of the gamma-secretase complex. Next, we summarize the known subcellular locations of each gamma-secretase component and the sites of gamma-secretase activity, as defined by the production of Abeta. Finally, we close by synthesizing all of the included topics into an overarching model for the assembly and trafficking of the gamma-secretase complex, which serves as a launching point for further questions into the biology and function of gamma-secretase in Alzheimer's disease.

The gamma-secretase complex has a decisive role in the development of Alzheimer's disease, in that it cleaves a precursor to create the amyloid beta peptide whose aggregates form the senile plaques encountered in the brains of patients. Gamma-secretase is a member of the intramembrane-cleaving proteases which process their transmembrane substrates within the bilayer. Many of the mutations encountered in early onset familial Alzheimer's disease are linked to presenilin 1, the catalytic component of gamma-secretase, whose active form requires its endoproteolytic cleavage into N-terminal and C-terminal fragments. Although there is general agreement regarding the topology of the N-terminal fragment, studies of the C-terminal fragment have yielded ambiguous and contradictory results that may be difficult to reconcile in the absence of structural information. Here we present the first structure of the C-terminal fragment of human presenilin 1, as obtained from NMR studies in SDS micelles. The structure reveals a topology where the membrane is likely traversed three times in accordance with the more generally accepted nine transmembrane domain model of presenilin 1, but contains unique structural features adapted to accommodate the unusual intramembrane catalysis. These include a putative half-membrane-spanning helix N-terminally harboring the catalytic aspartate, a severely kinked helical structure toward the C terminus as well as a soluble helix in the assumed-to-be unstructured N-terminal loop.

The biogenesis and accumulation of the beta amyloid protein (Abeta) is a key event in the cascade of oxidative and inflammatory processes that characterises Alzheimer's disease. The presenilins and its interacting proteins play a pivotal role in the generation of Abeta from the amyloid precursor protein (APP). In particular, three proteins (nicastrin, aph-1 and pen-2) interact with presenilins to form a large multi-subunit enzymatic complex (gamma-secretase) that cleaves APP to generate Abeta. Reconstitution studies in yeast and insect cells have provided strong evidence that these four proteins are the major components of the gamma-secretase enzyme. Current research is directed at elucidating the roles that each of these protein play in the function of this enzyme. In addition, a number of presenilin interacting proteins that are not components of gamma-secretase play important roles in modulating Abeta production. This review will discuss the components of the gamma-secretase complex and the role of presenilin interacting proteins on gamma-secretase activity.

The gamma-secretase, composed of presenilin-1 (PS1) or presenilin-2 (PS2), nicastrin (NCT), anterior pharynx-defective phenotype 1 (APH-1), and PEN-2, is critical for the development of Alzheimer's disease (AD). PSs are autoproteolytically cleaved, producing an N-terminal fragment (NTF) and a hydrophilic loop domain-containing C-terminal fragment. However, the role of the loop domain in the gamma-secretase complex assembly remains unknown. Here, we report a novel PS2 isoform generated by alternative splicing, named PS2beta, which is composed of an NTF with a hydrophilic loop domain. PS2beta disturbed the interaction between NCT and APH-1, resulting in the inhibition of amyloid-beta production. We concluded that PS2beta may inhibit gamma-secretase activity by affecting the gamma-secretase complex assembly.

Senescence-accelerated mice (SAMP8) serve as a model for Alzheimer's disease (AD) as they exhibit early loss of memory and increased amyloid precursor protein (APP) expression. APP is a ubiquitous membrane protein that is physiologically processed by site-specific proteolysis firstly by alpha- or beta-secretases, releasing a large fragment called APP(S) that contains most of the extracellular sequences of APP, a small extracellular stub, the transmembrane region and the cytoplasmic tail of APP (;AICD'-APP intracellular domain). These are subsequently cleaved by gamma-secretase at multiple sites in the transmembrane region, releasing small peptides, Abeta(1-40) and Abeta(1-42), the major components of AD-associated amyloid fibrils. gamma-secretase is a high-molecular-mass complex composed of presenilin-1 (PS1), nicastrin, APH-1 and Pen-2. As PS1 has been shown to play a critical role in facilitating gamma-secretase activity, and mutations in this protein are associated with familial AD (FAD), we have cloned it from SAMP8 mouse hippocampus and compared its sequence with those of other species. Furthermore, changes in the expression of PS1 with age in the hippocampal tissue of SAMP8 were studied. The results showed that the SAMP8 PS1 cDNA sequence is identical to that of normal mice. However, its expression in the hippocampus of SAMP8 exhibited an increase, while CD-1 mice, a strain that does not exhibit premature memory loss, showed no change with age. An increased amount or mutation(s) in PS1, which alters the stoichiometric balance of the gamma-secretase complex, may be the cause of aberrant or increased processing of APP, resulting in Abeta accumulation leading to loss of memory.

Alzheimer's disease is known to be the most common form of dementia in the elderly. It is clinically characterized by impairment of cognitive functions, as well as changes in personality, behavioral disturbances and an impaired ability to perform activities of daily living. To date, there are no effective ways to cure or reverse the disease. Genetic studies of early-onset familial Alzheimer's disease cases revealed causative mutations in the genes encoding β-amyloid precursor protein and the γ-secretase-complex components presenilin-1 and presenilin-2, supporting an important role of β-amyloid in the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease. Compromised function of the choroid plexus and defective cerebrospinal fluid production and turnover, with diminished clearance of β-amyloid, may play an important role in late-onset forms of Alzheimer's disease. If reduced cerebrospinal fluid turnover is a risk factor for Alzheimer's disease, then therapeutic strategies to improve cerebrospinal fluid flow are reasonable. However, the role of deficient cerebrospinal fluid dynamics in Alzheimer's disease and the relevance of choroidal proteins as potential therapeutic targets to enhance cerebrospinal fluid turnover have received relatively little research attention. In this paper, we discuss several choroidal proteins, such as Na(+)-K(+) ATPase, carbonic anhydrase, and aquaporin 1, that may be targets for pharmacological up-regulation of cerebrospinal fluid formation. The search for potentially beneficial drugs useful to ameliorate Alzheimer's disease by facilitating cerebrospinal fluid production and turnover may be an important area for future research. However, the ultimate utility of such modulators in the management of Alzheimer's disease remains to be determined. Here, we hypothesize that caffeine, the most commonly used psychoactive drug in the world, may be an attractive therapeutic candidate for treatment of Alzheimer's disease since long-term caffeine consumption may augment cerebrospinal fluid production. Other potential mechanisms of cognitive protection by caffeine have been suggested by recent studies.

Presenilins form the catalytic part of the gamma-secretases, protein complexes that are responsible for the intramembranous cleavage of transmembrane proteins. The presenilins are involved in several biological functions, but are best known for their role in the generation of the beta-amyloid (Abeta) peptide in Alzheimer's disease and are therefore thought to be important drug targets for this disorder. Mutations in the presenilin genes cause early-onset familial Alzheimer's disease, but mutation carriers have substantial phenotypic heterogeneity. Recent evidence implicating presenilin mutations in non-Alzheimer's dementias, including frontotemporal dementia and Lewy body dementia, warrants further investigation. An increased understanding of the diversity of the molecular cell biology of the gamma-secretase complex and the effects of clinical mutations in the presenilin genes might help pave the way for improved development of drugs that are designed to target gamma-secretase enzymatic activity in Alzheimer's disease and potentially in other neurological diseases.

Amyloid-beta peptides (Abeta) generated by proteolysis of the beta-amyloid precursor protein (APP) by beta- and gamma-secretases play an important role in the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease (AD). There is mounting evidence that the lipid matrix of neuronal cell membranes plays an important role in the accumulation of Abeta peptides into senile plaques, one of the hallmarks of AD. With the aim to clarify the molecular basis of the interaction between Abeta and cellular membranes, we investigated the effects of various phospholipids (PLs) and a PL-rich diet on Abeta production. Here we show that modulation of Abeta production and Abeta42:40 ratio is not limited to individual fatty acids, rather it is the composition of the PLs of the membrane bilayer, that influences the specificity and level of the regulated intramembranous proteolysis of APP by the gamma-secretase complex. We show that Abeta levels in the conditioned media, in response to some of the PL supplements, is increased in the center and decreased on either side of a graph that resembles bell-shaped distribution. This means that the PLs have less of a tendency to produce unusually extreme effects on Abeta production in SP-C99 transfected Cos-7 cultured cells. We proposed a mechanism-based hypothesis to rationalize PLs' effects on Abeta production.
