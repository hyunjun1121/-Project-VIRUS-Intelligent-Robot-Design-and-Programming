What drug, used to treat rheumatoid arthritis, is an interleukin-1 receptor antagonist?

[PMID: 12932294]
Anakinra, the recombinant form of IL-1 receptor antagonist (IL-1Ra), has been approved for clinical use in the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis as the drug Kineret trade mark, but it must be administered daily by subcutaneous injection. Gene transfer may offer a more effective means of delivery. In this study, using prostaglandin E2 production as a measure of stimulation, we quantitatively compared the ability of anakinra, as well as that of IL-1Ra delivered by gene transfer, to inhibit the biologic actions of IL-1beta. Human synovial fibroblast cultures were incubated with a range of doses of anakinra or HIG-82 cells genetically modified to constitutively express IL-1Ra. The cultures were then challenged with recombinant human IL-1beta either simultaneously with addition of the source of IL-1Ra or 24 hours later. In a similar manner, the potencies of the two sources of IL-1Ra were compared when human synovial fibroblasts were challenged with IL-1beta produced constitutively by genetically modified cells. No significant difference in inhibitory activity was observed between recombinant protein and IL-1Ra provided by the genetically modified cells, under static culture conditions, even following incubation for 4 days. However, under culture conditions that provided progressive dilution of the culture media, striking differences between these methods of protein delivery became readily apparent. Constitutive synthesis of IL-1Ra by the genetically modified cells provided sustained or increased protection from IL-1 stimulation over time, whereas the recombinant protein became progressively less effective. This was particularly evident under conditions of continuous IL-1beta synthesis.

(1) Anakinra is an interleukin-1 receptor antagonist (IL-1ra), which blocks interleukin-1 (IL-1), a protein involved in the inflammation and the joint destruction associated with rheumatoid arthritis (RA). (2) The manufacturer's submission for drug approval is currently under review by Health Canada and the FDA. (3) In randomized controlled trials, patients with severe RA were treated with anakinra. Significant improvement was demonstrated in several clinical, radiologic and health-related quality of life measures in patients treated with anakinra versus placebo. (4) Minimal adverse effects, mainly injection site reactions, were reported.

Anakinra (Kineret) is the first biologic drug that has been developed specifically as an interleukin (IL)-1 receptor antagonist (Ra) and is derived from an endogenous IL-1Ra. The drug blocks the activity of IL-1 in synovial joints, reducing the inflammatory and joint destructive processes associated with rheumatoid arthritis (RA). In randomized, placebo-controlled trials of up to 52 weeks' duration, anakinra has shown efficacy both as monotherapy and in combination with other disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs (DMARDs) in adults with RA. It is subcutaneously administered and is generally well tolerated. Anakinra offers a useful addition to the range of drugs available for the treatment of RA.

The anti-interleukin-1 receptor antagonist, anakinra, was approved for the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis (RA) more than 12 years ago. However, its adverse effects are not well known. Areas covered: We review the safety profile of anakinra, analyzing clinical trials, observational studies, and registry data. Expert opinion: Due to its lower efficacy compared with other biological therapies approved for RA and its daily subcutaneous administration, anakinra is used only marginally for the treatment of RA. This has limited the experience with this drug in RA, with a lack of data from long-term observational studies or registries. From the five clinical trials performed, and given the unfeasibility of developing new studies of anakinra in RA, it may be concluded that site injection reactions, infections at higher doses (>100 mg), and immunogenicity are the most frequent adverse events related to anakinra administration.

Juvenile idiopathic arthritis is group of diseases of unknown aetiology characterised by the occurrence of chronic arthritis during childhood. Compared to adult onset rheumatoid arthritis, its course is more variable. Increasing knowledge of the inflammatory process as well as in molecular genetics and biotechnology has enable the production of new drugs, the biologicals. These are able to specifically block mechanisms of immune activation and thereby interfere with the inflammatory process. An increasing number of biologicals have been tried in clinical studies in adults suffering from rheumatoid arthritis, psoriasis or psoriasis arthritis and a couple of them were already licensed for treatment. Treatment of juvenile idiopathic arthritis by blockade of tumournecrosis-factor (TNF) using the soluble receptor Etanercept or the monoclonal antibodies Infliximab and Adalimumab showed comparable clinical efficacy. Blockade of TNF therefore already reached a certain place in the therapeutic algorythm for treatment of juvenile idiopathic arthritis. Currently, only Etanercept is licensed for treatment of active juvenile polyarthritis refractory to methotrexate. Studies using Infliximab and Adalimumab will be completed in the near future. However, antibodies blocking TNF may already be used in patients suffering from active uncontrolled chronic uveitis in whom visual impairment is threatening. TNF blockers may also be indicated in juvenile ankylosing spondylitis. The use of further biologicals, the interleukin-1 receptor antagonist Anakinra, Atlizumab (MRA) blocking the receptor for interleukin-6 or Abatacept, an inhibitory ligand of the co-stimulatory T cell membrane molecule CD28, remain experimental and should be preserved for clinical studies.

Anakinra is an anti-IL-1RA targeting IL-1β with a central role in the occurrence of auto-inflammatory diseases. Its use is not without risk. We report a case of late onset auto-inflammatory syndrome treated with anti-IL-1RA whose progression was marked by deep isolated thrombocytopenia, rapidly regressive after discontinuation of anakinra. Immuno-allergic thrombocytopenia to anakinra is a rare, but serious adverse event.

Anakinra is a specific receptor antagonist of interleukin-1 that differs from naturally occurring interleukin-1 receptor antagonist by the presence of a methionine group. It is administered by daily subcutaneous injection. Anakinra improves the clinical signs and symptoms of rheumatoid arthritis, slows radiographic progression and improves patient physical function. The most common adverse event is an injection site reaction. Anakinra has been associated with an increased incidence of serious infections and has an increased standardized incidence ratio for lymphoma. It has not been found to be associated with the development of opportunistic infections, worsening of congestive heart failure or the development of demyelinating disease. It appears to be effective in treating adult Stills disease, systemic-onset juvenile idiopathic arthritis and chronic infantile neurological cutaneous and articular syndrome (also known as neonatal-onset multisystem inflammatory disease syndrome).

Anakinra (Kineret), a recombinant form of human interleukin-1 (IL-1) receptor antagonist, is approved for the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis (RA) in combination with methotrexate. Kineret is self-administered by daily subcutaneous injections in patients with active RA. The mechanism of action of anakinra is to competitively inhibit the local inflammatory effects of IL-1. Kineret is generally safe and well tolerated and the only major treatment-related side effects that appear are skin reactions at the injection site. Due to the relatively short half-life of anakinra, daily injection of the drug is required. This, in combination with the comparably high rates of injection-site reactions (ISRs) associated with the drug, can become a problem for the patient. The present review summarises published data concerning ISRs associated with Kineret and provides some explanations as to their cause. The objective is also to present some clinical experiences of how the ISRs can be managed.

Anakinra, an interleukin-1 receptor antagonist and tocilizumab, an interleukin-6 receptor blocker, are used for the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis. We investigated the differential effects of anakinra and tocilizumab on myocardial and vascular function in an atherosclerosis model of patients with rheumatoid arthritis. 120 patients with rheumatoid arthritis were randomized to anakinra (n = 40), tocilizumab (n = 40) or prednisolone (n = 40) for 3 months. Primary outcome measure was the change of left ventricular longitudinal strain after 3 months of treatment. Additionally, we measured coronary flow reserve, flow-mediated dilatation of the brachial artery, carotid-femoral pulse wave velocity, malondialdehyde and protein carbonyls as oxidative stress markers and C-reactive protein blood levels at baseline and post-treatment. At baseline, patients among the three treatment arms had similar age, sex, disease activity score and atherosclerotic risk factors. Compared with baseline, all patients had improved longitudinal strain (- 16% vs. - 17.8%), coronary flow reserve (2.56 vs. 2.9), malondialdehyde (2.0 vs. 1.5 µM/L), protein carbonyls (0.0132 vs. 0.0115 nmol/mg), and C-reactive protein post-treatment. In all patients, the percent decrease of malondialdehyde was correlated with percent increase of longitudinal strain (p < 0.001). Compared with tocilizumab and prednisolone, anakinra treatment resulted in a greater improvement of longitudinal strain (18.7% vs. 9.7% vs. 6%) and coronary flow reserve (29% vs. 13% vs. 1%), while pulse wave velocity and brachial blood pressure were improved only after tocilizumab treatment (11 ± 3 vs. 10.3 ± 2 m/s p < 0.05 for all comparisons). Anakinra is associated with an improvement in cardiac function and tocilizumab with improvement in vascular function. URL: https:// http://www.clinicaltrials.gov . Unique identifier: NCT03288584.

Interleukin-1 (IL-1) is one of the main inflammatory mediators associated with development of rheumatoid arthritis (RA). Deficiency in secretion of the natural IL-1 antagonist was found in RA patients, and enhanced joint inflammation. This finding was confirmed by numerous studies using the animal model of the disease. Two randomized, multicenter clinical trials with anakinra, a recombinant IL-1 receptor antagonist (rHHHuIL-1Ra), revealed that application of anakinra with or without methotrexate induces remission (ACR 20) in 38-71% of patients with RA. Induction of remission was dose and treatment-time-dependent. The present paper reviews theoretical application of rHuIL-1Ra in patients with RA and summarizes results of published clinical trials of the drug.

Interleukin -1 receptor antagonist ( IL-1Ra ) is a new option among biotherapies against rheumatoid arthritis ( RA ). of this review is to recall the rationale of use of IL-1Ra and to analyse the results available in the current literature. Pathophysiological data of RA give a specific position for IL-1 as a potential target for immunotherapy in this disease, confirmed in animal models. Phase II and III studies with IL-1Ra (Anakinra) demonstrated clinical efficacy versus placebo (42% responders in ACR 20 in Anakinra + methotrexate, and 23% in the placebo + methotrexate group at 24 weeks) and a structural effect (slowing of radiological progression at six months). Anakinra has obtained an European license and is indicated in RA not controlled by methotrexate, in daily subcutaneous administration (100 mg/day), in combination with methotrexate. Tolerance is fair; the most frequent side effect is represented by injection site reactions. This ambulatory biotherapy offers new perspectives in combination with other slow acting drugs as well as biologic agents such as anti-TNF, currently under evaluation.

Anakinra is a recombinant human interleukin-1 receptor antagonist (IL-1ra) recently approved by the FDA as a new therapy for patients with rheumatoid arthritis. Four clinical trials have been completed which have demonstrated that anakinra is an effective anti-rheumatic therapy either used alone or in combination with methotrexate. The most frequent adverse events reported in the clinical trials are injection-site reactions which are generally mild to moderate and rapidly resolve. A large, prospective safety study which allowed a wide-variety of comorbid conditions and concomitant medications demonstrated that anakinra therapy is a well-tolerated treatment for rheumatoid arthritis in the patient population seen by the practicing rheumatologist. Unlike therapies designed to affect TNF-alpha, there have not yet been reports of the development of tuberculosis or other fungal infections, demylinating syndromes or worsening of congestive heart failure. The safety profile of etanercept and infliximab were similar to that of anakinra in the phase I-phase III clinical trials. Unlike anakinra, these medications were not studied in the usual rheumatoid arthritis population which includes a number of patients with a wide variety of co-morbid disease and utilizing a number of concomitant anti-rheumatic medications. Post approval, several safety concerns, including patients at risk for serious infection and the emergence of latent tuberculosis and other opportunistic infections have emerged with the use of anti TNF therapy.

This study evaluated the benefit of anakinra, a human recombinant form of interleukin 1 receptor antagonist, on the functional status of patients with active rheumatoid arthritis (RA) despite taking maximally tolerated doses of methotrexate (MTX). Patients (n = 419) were randomized to receive, in addition to MTX (15 to 25 mg/wk), placebo or anakinra doses of 0.04, 0.1, 0.4, 1, or 2 mg/kg once daily for 24 weeks. Functional status measured on 8 scales (dressing and grooming, arising, eating, walking, hygiene, reach, grip, and activities) was evaluated at baseline and every 4 weeks with the Health Assessment Questionnaire (HAQ). A weighted sum of the scale scores is the HAQ disability index (HAQ-DI). Primary analysis of the HAQ-DI was based on an omnibus test for a positive dose-response relationship between anakinra treatment and change in HAQ-DI from baseline to week 24. Patients receiving anakinra experienced rapid and sizeable improvements in their HAQ-DI scores in a dose-related fashion. For patients receiving either of the 2 highest doses of anakinra, improvements in the HAQ-DI occurred by week 4 that were of a magnitude considered clinically important and statistically significantly superior to placebo. In patients with persistence of RA despite MTX therapy, treatment with anakinra results in a rapid improvement in functional status as measured by the HAQ-DI.

Anakinra, a recombinant human interleukin-1 (IL-1) receptor antagonist, is the first biological agent approved to block the pro-inflammatory effects of IL-1 in patients with rheumatoid arthritis. In a double-blind, randomised trial in 472 patients with active, severe or very severe rheumatoid arthritis, recipients of subcutaneous anakinra 150 mg/day achieved higher response rates [assessed using the American College of Rheumatology (ACR) composite score] and accumulated more mean productivity days after 6 months than placebo recipients. However, the response rates and accumulated productivity days of patients receiving subcutaneous anakinra 30 or 75 mg/day for 6 months were similar to those of placebo. With respect to the total Genant radiographic scores, the same study showed that all anakinra treatment regimens slowed disease progression after 6 months to a greater extent than placebo. In double-blind, randomised trials in patients with rheumatoid arthritis, combined treatment with anakinra and methotrexate was associated with higher ACR 20, 50 and 70 response rates than with methotrexate alone. Anakinra, used alone or in combination with methotrexate, was generally well tolerated, with the most frequent adverse event being a mild injection-site reaction of transient duration. Infections requiring antibacterial therapy or hospitalisation occurred more commonly in anakinra recipients than in placebo recipients, but were a rare cause for discontinuation of anakinra therapy (approximately 1%) in clinical trials.

New treatment strategies in rheumatoid arthritis are targeted to interfere with critical mediators of inflammation. Proinflammatory cytokines like IL-1 beta and TNFalpha play a crucial role in induction and maintenance of synovitis, pannus formation and bone and cartilage destruction. Within a few years, these morphological changes may lead to joint destruction and consecutively to functional impairment. Since April 2002 a recombinant human interleukin-1 receptor antagonist (Anakinra) is available in Germany for treatment of patients with rheumatoid arthritis. Anakinra (Kineret(R)) is approved for therapy in combination with methotrexate and should be applied according to guidelines established by the German Rheumatology Society for the use of biologicals in treatment of patients with rheumatoid arthritis. The approval of anakinra as a new therapeutic is based on data obtained in large multicenter, placebo-controlled, and randomised trials in comparison to placebo. Treatment of Anakinra as monotherapy or in combination with methotrexate lead to significant improvement of signs and symptoms of disease as measured by the ACR 20 (or more) response and was associated with a slower radiographic progression with regard to joint space narrowing and development of erosions. Anakinra showed a favourable safety profile with injection side reactions as the predominant side effect that occurs in 70% of patients usually after 10-12 days of treatment and that are mostly mild to moderate and self-limiting. Patients with previous pneumonia or other risk factors for pulmonary infections such as chronic obstructive lung disease seem to show a slightly increased risk of developing infectious complications of the bronchopulmonary system while being on anakinra and should be monitored appropriately. Combining IL-1ra treatment with the use of anti-TNF agents showed an increased risk of infectious complications in clinical studies and is not recommended at present. Studies are currently assessing the use of anakinra for treatment of other rheumatic diseases like psoriatic arthritis, juvenile arthritis or spondylarthropathy.

The efficacy and safety of anakinra, a recombinant human interleukin 1 (IL1) receptor antagonist used in rheumatoid arthritis, has been documented in five randomised controlled studies. However, long term post-marketing efficacy data are lacking. To evaluate the efficacy, safety, and drug survival of anakinra in clinical practice. All patients with rheumatoid arthritis who started anakinra in six hospitals between May 2002 and February 2004 were included in a two year prospective, in part retrospective, cohort study. Efficacy was assessed using the 28 joint disease activity score (DAS28) and the EULAR response criteria. Safety was evaluated using the common toxicity criteria. Drug survival and prognostic factors were analysed using Kaplan-Meier and Cox proportional hazard analyses. After three months, 55% of the patients (n = 146) showed a response (43% moderate, 12% good). A subset of patients continuing anakinra after 18 months had a sustained clinical response compared with patients who switched to other disease modifying antirheumatic drug treatment (DAS28 improvement, 2.46 v 1.79). Drug survival was 78%, 54%, and 14% after three, six, and 24 months, respectively. The reason for discontinuation was lack of efficacy in 78% and adverse events in 22%. Except for higher drug survival in women (odds ratio = 0.51, 95% confidence interval, 0.27 to 0.97), no prognostic factors were found. Adverse events were reported 206 times in 111 patients, the most common being injection site reactions (36%). Serious adverse events occurred in 12% of the patients, with one classified as related. The short term efficacy and safety profile of anakinra are comparable to those found in randomised clinical studies. However, the drug survival of anakinra after two years is low, mostly because of lack of efficacy.

To evaluate the safety of anakinra (a recombinant human interleukin-1 receptor antagonist) in a large population of patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA), typical of those seen in clinical practice. A total of 1,414 patients were randomly assigned to treatment with 100 mg of anakinra or placebo, administered daily by subcutaneous injection. Background medications included disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs, corticosteroids, and nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs, alone or in combination. The primary end point was safety, which was evaluated by adverse events (including infections), discontinuation from study due to adverse events, and death. Safety was evaluated in 1,399 patients (1,116 in the anakinra group and 283 in the placebo group; 15 patients were randomized but did not receive any study drug) during the initial 6-month, double-blind, placebo-controlled phase of this long-term safety study. Baseline demographics, disease characteristics, and concomitant medications were similar between the 2 groups. The study group included patients with numerous comorbid conditions and a wide range of RA disease activity. Serious adverse events occurred at a similar rate in the anakinra group and the placebo group (7.7% and 7.8%, respectively). Serious infectious episodes were observed more frequently in the anakinra group (2.1% versus 0.4% in the placebo group). The rate of withdrawal due to adverse events was 13.4% in the anakinra group and 9.2% in the placebo group. Results from this large, placebo-controlled safety study demonstrate that anakinra is safe and well tolerated in a diverse population of patients with RA, including those with comorbid conditions and those using multiple combinations of concomitant therapies. Although the frequency of serious infection was slightly higher in the anakinra group, no infection was attributed to opportunistic microorganisms or resulted in death.

To assess the efficacy and safety of 100 mg daily anakinra (Kineret), a recombinant form of the naturally occurring interleukin 1 receptor antagonist, plus methotrexate (MTX) in reducing the signs and symptoms of rheumatoid arthritis (RA). Patients with active RA (n = 506) despite current treatment with MTX were enrolled in this multicentre, double blind, randomised, placebo controlled study. Patients received subcutaneous injections of anakinra 100 mg/day or placebo. They were assessed monthly for 6 months for improvement in signs and symptoms of RA and for adverse events. The primary efficacy measure was the percentage of patients attaining ACR20 response at week 24. Significantly greater proportions of patients treated with anakinra compared with placebo achieved ACR20 (38% v 22%; p<0.001), ACR50 (17% v 8%; p<0.01), and ACR70 (6% v 2%; p<0.05) responses. The response to anakinra was rapid; the proportion of patients with an ACR20 response at the first study assessment (4 weeks) was twice as high with anakinra as with placebo (p<0.005). Clinically meaningful and statistically significant responses were also seen in individual components of the ACR response (for example, Health Assessment Questionnaire, pain, C reactive protein levels, and erythrocyte sedimentation rate). Anakinra was well tolerated, with a safety profile, similar to that of placebo with one exception: mild to moderate injection site reactions were more common with anakinra than with placebo (65% v 24%). This study confirms previous observations from a dose-ranging study showing that anakinra, in combination with MTX, is an effective and safe treatment for patients with RA who have inadequate responses to MTX alone.

Anakinra, a recombinant human interleukin-1 receptor antagonist offers a new potent treatment for rheumatoid arthritis(RA). It is administered as a daily single subcutaneous injection. Recent randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trials revealed that anakinra significantly reduces the signs and symptoms of RA, reduces joint destruction, and is safe and tolerated. It was also revealed that anakinra is more potent when used in combination with methotrexate.

Impaired healing of the skin is a notable cause of patient morbidity and mortality. In diabetic individuals, dysregulated inflammation contributes to delayed wound healing. Specific immunomodulatory agents may have a role in the treatment of diabetic wounds. One of these molecules is interleukin-1 receptor antagonist (Anakinra; Amgen Corp.). Although interleukin-1 receptor antagonist (Anakinra; Amgen Corp.) is approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis and neonatal-onset multisystem inflammatory disease, little is known about the local use this drug in cutaneous wound healing. Therefore, the aim of this study is to determine the effect of locally administered interleukin-1 receptor antagonist on delayed wound healing, specifically, in a diabetic mouse model. Two 6-mm full-thickness wounds were created on the dorsa of diabetic (db/db) mice and stented. One-hour postwounding, wound margins were subcutaneously injected with either (1) low-dose interleukin-1 receptor antagonist in a gelatin-transglutaminase gel vehicle or (2) the gel vehicle only. Wounds were imaged on days 0, 7, 14, and 21 postwounding, and wound area was determined. Wound biopsies were collected on day 21 and immunohistochemically stained for neutrophil and macrophage infiltration. Wounds treated with interleukin-1 receptor antagonist had significantly smaller wound area than nontreated wounds on day 7 and day 14 postwounding. Treated wounds also showed significantly less neutrophil and macrophage infiltration. These findings support the hypothesis that interleukin-1 receptor antagonist may have an important role in cutaneous wound healing, possibly by promoting successful resolution of acute inflammation and hence accelerating wound closure. Thereby, administration of IL-1Ra may be useful in the treatment of nonhealing wounds.

Interleukin (IL)-1 plays an important role not only in the mediation of inflammation but also in the destruction of cartilage and bone. Together with TNF-alpha it is one of the most important cytokines in the pathogenesis of rheumatoid arthritis (RA) and juvenile idiopathic arthritis (JIA). The first IL-1 antagonist to be approved for RA was Anakinra, an IL-1 receptor antagonist. Anakinra appears to be less effective for RA than TNF blockers. Hence, Anakinra is rarely used for the treatment of RA, but more for the treatment of IL-1-mediated diseases such as autoinflammatory syndromes, adult-onset Still's disease and systemic onset JIA. Two newer IL-1 antagonists have recently been approved for the treatment of CAPS (cryopyrin-associated periodic syndromes): Canakinumab, a fully human IL-1beta antibody, and rilonacept, a fusion protein consisting of the ligand-binding domain of the IL-1 receptor and the IL-1-receptor accessory protein, bound to human IgG1. For RA, there is only one proof-of-concept study to date with canakinumab. There are no prospective data for the treatment of patients with RA who did not respond to or tolerate TNF antagonists; in a retrospective analysis, only 8% of anti-TNF pretreated patients achieved an ACR 20 response.

Interleukin-1 (IL-1) is a primary cytokine that is involved in the pathogenesis of rheumatoid arthritis; it contributes to inflammation and joint destruction. Anakinra (Kineret) is an IL-1 receptor antagonist that blocks the biologic activity of IL-1. It was approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis in 2001. Anakinra is safe and effective in the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis, both as monotherapy and in combination with other disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs. This article reviews the preclinical, clinical, and postmarketing data on the safety and efficacy of anakinra in the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis and focuses on the pivotal clinical trials that led to FDA approval.

The safety profile of interleukin-1 receptor antagonist (anakinra) has been studied with randomised, placebo-controlled trials involving 2932 patients affected by rheumatoid arthritis. The most frequently reported adverse events were represented by injection site reactions (71%) and headache (13.6%). No statistically significant difference in the incidence of infections was observed among the patients treated with the interleukin-1 receptor antagonist and the patients receiving placebo. In particular, the incidence of serious infections was 1,8% in rheumatoid arthritis patients on anakinra therapy and 0,7% in patients on placebo. The reported serious infections consisted of pneumonia, cellulitis, bone and joint infections, bursitis. No case of opportunistic infections or tubercolosis was observed. The results of clinical studies suggest that anakinra is a new well-tolerated drug for the treatment of patients affected by rheumatoid arthritis.
