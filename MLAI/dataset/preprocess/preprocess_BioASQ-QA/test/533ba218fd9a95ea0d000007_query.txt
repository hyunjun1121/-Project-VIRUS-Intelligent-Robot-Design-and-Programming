What is the clinical indication of cardiac T1 mapping magnetic resonance?

Anderson-Fabry disease (AFD) is a rare but underdiagnosed intracellular lipid disorder that can cause left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH). Lipid is known to shorten the magnetic resonance imaging parameter T1. We hypothesized that noncontrast T1 mapping by cardiovascular magnetic resonance would provide a novel and useful measure in this disease with potential to detect early cardiac involvement and distinguish AFD LVH from other causes. Two hundred twenty-seven subjects were studied: patients with AFD (n=44; 55% with LVH), healthy volunteers (n=67; 0% with LVH), patients with hypertension (n=41; 24% with LVH), patients with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (n=34; 100% with LVH), those with severe aortic stenosis (n=21; 81% with LVH), and patients with definite amyloid light-chain (AL) cardiac amyloidosis (n=20; 100% with LVH). T1 mapping was performed using the shortened modified Look-Locker inversion sequence on a 1.5-T magnet before gadolinium administration with primary results derived from the basal and midseptum. Compared with health volunteers, septal T1 was lower in AFD and higher in other diseases (AFD versus healthy volunteers versus other patients, 882±47, 968±32, 1018±74 milliseconds; P<0.0001). In patients with LVH (n=105), T1 discriminated completely between AFD and other diseases with no overlap. In AFD, T1 correlated inversely with wall thickness (r=-0.51; P=0.0004) and was abnormal in 40% of subjects who did not have LVH. Segmentally, AFD showed pseudonormalization or elevation of T1 in the left ventricular inferolateral wall, correlating with the presence or absence of late gadolinium enhancement (1001±82 versus 891±38 milliseconds; P<0.0001). Noncontrast T1 mapping shows potential as a unique and powerful measurement in the imaging assessment of LVH and AFD.

T2w-CMR is used widely to assess myocardial edema. Quantitative T1-mapping is also sensitive to changes in free water content. We hypothesized that T1-mapping would have a higher diagnostic performance in detecting acute edema than dark-blood and bright-blood T2w-CMR. We investigated 21 controls (55 ± 13 years) and 21 patients (61 ± 10 years) with Takotsubo cardiomyopathy or acute regional myocardial edema without infarction. CMR performed within 7 days included cine, T1-mapping using ShMOLLI, dark-blood T2-STIR, bright-blood ACUT2E and LGE imaging. We analyzed wall motion, myocardial T1 values and T2 signal intensity (SI) ratio relative to both skeletal muscle and remote myocardium. All patients had acute cardiac symptoms, increased Troponin I (0.15-36.80 ug/L) and acute wall motion abnormalities but no LGE. T1 was increased in patient segments with abnormal and normal wall motion compared to controls (1113 ± 94 ms, 1029 ± 59 ms and 944 ± 17 ms, respectively; p < 0.001). T2 SI ratio using STIR and ACUT2E was also increased in patient segments with abnormal and normal wall motion compared to controls (all p < 0.02). Receiver operator characteristics analysis showed that T1-mapping had a significantly larger area-under-the-curve (AUC = 0.94) compared to T2-weighted methods, whether the reference ROI was skeletal muscle or remote myocardium (AUC = 0.58-0.89; p < 0.03). A T1 value of greater than 990 ms most optimally differentiated segments affected by edema from normal segments at 1.5 T, with a sensitivity and specificity of 92 %. Non-contrast T1-mapping using ShMOLLI is a novel method for objectively detecting myocardial edema with a high diagnostic performance. T1-mapping may serve as a complementary technique to T2-weighted imaging for assessing myocardial edema in ischemic and non-ischemic heart disease, such as quantifying area-at-risk and diagnosing myocarditis.

Late gadolinium enhancement is the technique of choice for detecting myocardial fibrosis. Although this technique is used in a wide range of cardiovascular pathologies, ischemic cardiomyopathy and the workup for myocarditis and other cardiomyopathies make up a significant proportion of the total indications. Multiple studies during the last decade have demonstrated its utility to adequately characterize myocardial tissue and offer diagnostic and prognostic information. Recent T1 mapping techniques aim to overcome the limitations of late gadolinium enhancement to assess diffuse fibrosis. ¹⁹F magnetic resonance has recently emerged as a promising technique for the assessment of inflammation. In the following review we will discuss the basic aspects of fibrosis assessment with MR and its utility for diagnostic and prognostic evaluation. We will also address the topic of cardiovascular inflammation imaging with ¹⁹F as a potential new development that may broaden the indications for MR in the future.

The purpose of this study was to use cardiac magnetic resonance (CMR) imaging and invasive left ventricular (LV) pressure-volume (PV) measurements to explore the relationship between diffuse myocardial fibrosis and indexes of diastolic performance in a cohort of cardiac transplant recipients. The precise mechanism of LV diastolic dysfunction in the presence of myocardial fibrosis has not previously been established. We performed CMR with T1 mapping and obtained invasive LV PV measurements via a conductance catheter in 20 cardiac transplant recipients at the time of clinically-indicated coronary angiography. Both post-contrast myocardial T1 time and extracellular volume fraction correlated with β, the load-independent passive LV stiffness constant (r = -0.71, p = 0.001, and r = 0.58, p = 0.04, respectively). After multivariate analysis, post-contrast myocardial T1 time remained the only independent predictor of β. No significant associations were observed between myocardial T1 time and τ, the active LV relaxation constant, or other load-dependent parameters of diastolic function. Diffuse myocardial fibrosis, assessed by post-contrast myocardial T1 time, correlates with invasively-demonstrated LV stiffness in cardiac transplant recipients. In patients with increased diffuse myocardial fibrosis, abnormal passive ventricular stiffness is therefore likely to be a major contributor to diastolic dysfunction.

The underlying pathophysiology of heart failure with preserved ejection fraction (HFPEF) is incompletely understood, but myocardial extracellular matrix accumulation is thought to play a major role. Our aims were to estimate myocardial extracellular matrix using cardiac magnetic resonance T1 mapping and to assess the relationship between pathobiology/pathophysiology and prognosis. Patients with suspected HFPEF (n=100) were enrolled in this prospective, observational study. Confirmatory diagnostic tests, cardiac magnetic resonance imaging including T1 mapping, and invasive hemodynamic assessments were performed at baseline. Sixty-one patients with confirmed HFPEF entered a longitudinal outcome-monitoring phase (mean, 22.9±5.0 months), during which 16 had a cardiac event. Cardiac magnetic resonance T1 time (hazard ratio, 0.99; 95% confidence interval, 0.98-0.99; P=0.046), left atrial area (hazard ratio, 1.08; 95% confidence interval, 1.03-1.13; P<0.01), and pulmonary vascular resistance (hazard ratio, 1.01; 95% confidence interval, 1.00-1.01; P=0.03) were significantly associated with cardiac events. Patients with T1 times below the median (<388.3 ms) were at greater risk of cardiac events than the rest of the group (P<0.01). Extracellular matrix of left ventricular biopsies (n=9), quantified by TissueFAXS technology correlated with T1 time (R=0.98; P<0.01). T1 time also correlated with right ventricular-pulmonary arterial coupling (pulmonary vascular resistance: R=-0.36; P<0.01; right ventricular ejection fraction: R=0.28; P=0.01). In the present preliminary study, cardiac magnetic resonance postcontrast T1 time is associated with prognosis in HFPEF, suggesting postcontrast T1 as possible biomarker for HFPEF.

A unique feature of cardiac magnetic resonance is its ability to characterize myocardium. Proton relaxation times, T1, T2, and T2* are a reflection of the composition of individual tissues, and change in the presence of disease. Research into T1 mapping has largely been focused in the study of cardiomyopathies, but T1 mapping also shows huge potential in the study of ischaemic heart disease. In fact, the first cardiac T1 maps were used to characterize myocardial infarction. Robust high-resolution myocardial T1 mapping is now available for use as a clinical tool. This quantitative technique is simple to perform and analyse, minimally subjective, and highly reproducible. This review aims to summarize the present state of research on the topic, and to show the clinical potential of this method to aid the diagnosis and treatment of patients with ischaemic heart disease.

Cardiac magnetic resonance (MR) imaging has grown over the past several decades into a validated, noninvasive diagnostic imaging tool with a pivotal role in cardiac morphologic and functional assessment and tissue characterization. With traditional cardiac MR imaging sequences, assessment of various pathologic conditions ranging from ischemic and nonischemic cardiomyopathy to cardiac involvement in systemic diseases (eg, amyloidosis and sarcoidosis) is possible; however, these sequences are most useful in focal myocardial disease, and image interpretation relies on subjective qualitative analysis of signal intensity. Newer T1 and T2 myocardial mapping techniques offer a quantitative assessment of the myocardium (by using T1 and T2 relaxation times), which can be helpful in focal disease, and demonstrate special utility in the evaluation of diffuse myocardial disease (eg, edema and fibrosis). Altered T1 and T2 relaxation times in disease states can be compared with published ranges of normal relaxation times in healthy patients. In conjunction with traditional cardiac MR imaging sequences, T1 and T2 mapping can limit the interpatient and interstudy variability that are common with qualitative analysis and may provide clinical markers for long-term follow-up.

Increased systemic inflammation has been linked to myocardial dysfunction and heart failure in patients with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE). Accurate detection of early myocardial changes may be able to guide preventive intervention. We investigated whether multiparametric imaging by cardiovascular magnetic resonance can detect differences between controls and asymptomatic SLE patients. A total of 33 SLE predominantly female patients (mean age, 40±9 years) underwent cardiovascular magnetic resonance for routine assessment of myocardial perfusion, function, and late gadolinium enhancement. T1 mapping was performed in single short-axis slice before and after 15 minutes of gadolinium administration. Twenty-one subjects with a low pretest probability and normal cardiovascular magnetic resonance served as a control group. Both groups had similar left ventricular volumes and mass and normal global systolic function. SLE patients had significantly reduced longitudinal strain (controls versus SLE, -20±2% versus -17±3%; P<0.01) and showed intramyocardial and pericardial late gadolinium enhancement. SLE patients had significantly increased native myocardial T1 (1056±27 versus 1152±46 milliseconds; P<0.001) and extracellular volume fraction (26±5% versus 30±6%; P=0.007) and reduced postcontrast myocardial T1 (454±53 versus 411±62 milliseconds; P=0.01). T1-derived indices were associated with longitudinal strain (r=0.37-0.47) but not with the presence of late gadolinium enhancement. Native myocardial T1 values showed the greatest concordance with the presence of clinical diagnosis of SLE. In patients with SLE and free of cardiac symptoms, there is evidence of subclinical perimyocardial impairment. We further demonstrate that T1 mapping may have potential to detect subclinical myocardial involvement in patients with SLE.

To optimize and validate a fully-integrated version of modified Look-Locker inversion-recovery (MOLLI) for clinical single-breathhold cardiac T1 mapping. A MOLLI variant allowing direct access to all pulse sequence parameters was implemented on a 1.5T MR system. Varying four critical sequence parameters, MOLLI was performed in eight gadolinium-doped agarose gel phantoms at different simulated heart rates. T1 values were derived for each variant and compared to nominal T1 values. Based on the results, MOLLI was performed in midcavity short-axis views of 20 healthy volunteers pre- and post-Gd-DTPA. In phantoms, a readout flip angle of 35 degrees , minimum TI of 100 msec, TI increment of 80 msec, and use of three pausing heart cycles allowed for most accurate and least heart rate-dependent T1 measurements. Using this pulse sequence scheme in humans, T1 relaxation times in normal myocardium were comparable to data from previous studies, and showed narrow ranges both pre- and postcontrast without heart rate dependency. We present an optimized implementation of MOLLI for fast T1 mapping with high spatial resolution, which can be integrated into routine imaging protocols. T1 accuracy is superior to the original set of pulse sequence parameters and heart rate dependency is avoided.

Myocardial fibrosis is a common feature of many cardiomyopathies, including hypertrophic cardiomyopathy. Myocardial fibrosis has been shown to be reversible and treatable with timely intervention. Although early detection and assessment of fibrosis is crucial, adequate diagnostics are still in development. Recent studies have shown progress on noninvasive imaging methods of fibrosis using cardiovascular magnetic resonance (CMR) and nuclear imaging modalities. T1 mapping and extracellular volume mapping (ECV) combined with CMR imaging are cutting edge methods that have the potential to assess interstitial myocardial fibrosis. Recent findings show that ECV measurement can be correlated to the extent of diffuse fibrosis. Comparatively, molecular imaging targets specific biomarkers in the fibrosis formation pathway and provides enhanced sensitivity for imaging early disease. Biomarkers include molecules involved in angiogenesis, ventricular remodeling, and fibrotic tissue formation, whereas collagen targeted agents can directly identify fibrotic tissue in the heart. This review introduces novel methods of fibrosis imaging that utilize properties of extracellular matrix and its biomarkers. Changes in characteristics and cellular biomarkers of the extracellular space can provide significant information regarding fibrosis formation and its role in cardiomyopathy. Ultimately, these findings may improve detection and monitoring of disease and improve efficiency and effectiveness of the treatment.

Conventional late gadolinium enhancement (LGE) cardiac magnetic resonance can detect myocardial infarction and some forms of non-ischaemic myocardial fibrosis. However, quantitative imaging of extracellular volume fraction (ECV) may be able to detect subtle abnormalities such as diffuse fibrosis or post-infarct remodelling of remote myocardium. The aims were (1) to measure ECV in myocardial infarction and non-ischaemic myocardial fibrosis, (2) to determine whether ECV varies with age, and (3) to detect sub-clinical abnormalities in 'normal appearing' myocardium remote from regions of infarction. Cardiac magnetic resonance ECV imaging was performed in 126 patients with T1 mapping before and after injection of gadolinium contrast. Conventional LGE images were acquired for the left ventricle. In patients with a prior myocardial infarction, the infarct region had an ECV of 51 ± 8% which did not overlap with the remote 'normal appearing' myocardium that had an ECV of 27 ± 3% (P < 0.001, n = 36). In patients with non-ischaemic cardiomyopathy, the ECV of atypical LGE was 37 ± 6%, whereas the 'normal appearing' myocardium had an ECV of 26 ± 3% (P < 0.001, n = 30). The ECV of 'normal appearing' myocardium increased with age (r = 0.28, P = 0.01, n = 60). The ECV of 'normal appearing' myocardium remote from myocardial infarctions increased as left ventricular ejection fraction decreased (r = -0.50, P = 0.02). Extracellular volume fraction imaging can quantitatively characterize myocardial infarction, atypical diffuse fibrosis, and subtle myocardial abnormalities not clinically apparent on LGE images. Taken within the context of prior literature, these subtle ECV abnormalities are consistent with diffuse fibrosis related to age and changes remote from infarction.

Diffuse interstitial fibrosis is present in diverse cardiomyopathies and associated with poor prognosis. We investigated whether magnetic resonance imaging-based T1 mapping could quantify the induction and pharmacological suppression of diffuse cardiac fibrosis in murine pressure-overload hypertrophy. Mice were subjected to transverse aortic constriction or sham surgery. The angiotensin receptor blocker losartan was given to half the animals. Cine-magnetic resonance imaging performed at 7 and 28 days showed hypertrophy and remodeling and systolic and diastolic dysfunction in transverse aortic constriction groups as expected. Late gadolinium-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging revealed focal signal enhancement at the inferior right ventricular insertion point of transverse aortic constriction mice concordant with the foci of fibrosis in histology. The extracellular volume fraction, calculated from pre- and postcontrast T1 measurements, was elevated by transverse aortic constriction and showed direct linear correlation with picrosirius red collagen volume fraction, thus confirming the suitability of extracellular volume fraction as an in vivo measure of diffuse fibrosis. Treatment with losartan reduced left ventricular dysfunction and prevented increased extracellular volume fraction, indicating that T1 mapping is sensitive to pharmacological prevention of fibrosis. Magnetic resonance imaging can detect diffuse and focal cardiac fibrosis in a clinically relevant animal model of pressure overload and is sensitive to pharmacological reduction of fibrosis by angiotensin receptor blockade. Thus, T1 mapping can be used to assess antifibrotic therapeutic strategies.

The impact of diffuse atrial fibrosis detected by T1 mapping on the clinical outcome after atrial fibrillation (AF) ablation is unknown. This study aimed to validate and assess the impact of post-contrast cardiac magnetic resonance (CMR) imaging atrial T1 mapping on the clinical outcome after catheter ablation for AF. CMR imaging was performed in 3 groups by using a clinical 1.5-T scanner: controls, patients with paroxysmal AF, and patients with persistent AF. A T1 mapping sequence was used to calculate the post-contrast T1 relaxation time (T1 time) at the interatrial septum as an index of diffuse atrial fibrosis. A subset underwent left atrial endocardial bipolar voltage mapping for electrophysiologic correlation. After AF ablation, patients underwent clinical review and 7-day Holter monitoring at 6-month intervals. One hundred thirty-two patients (20 controls, 71 (63%) patients with paroxysmal AF, and 41 (37%) patients with persistent AF) underwent CMR imaging. Post-contrast atrial T1 time was significantly shorter in AF groups (237 ± 42 ms) than in controls (280 ± 37 ms) (P < .001). Post-contrast atrial T1 time correlated with mean septal voltage (R2 = .48; P < .001) and global left atrial voltage (R(2) = .41; P < .001). A diagnosis of AF, AF duration, and left ventricular end-diastolic volume independently predicted shortened post-contrast atrial T1 time. The single procedure success rate was 74% at 12 ± 5 months postablation. Post-contrast atrial T1 time was the only predictor of arrhythmia recurrence in multivariate analysis (P = .015). A post-contrast atrial T1 time of >230 ms was associated with freedom from AF in 85% relative to 62% with a post-contrast atrial T1 time of <230 ms (P = .01). Post-contrast atrial T1 time as measured using CMR imaging provides an index of atrial fibrosis that correlates with tissue voltage, presence of AF, and clinical outcomes after catheter ablation.

Quantitative relaxation time measurements by cardiovascular magnetic resonance (CMR) are of paramount importance in contrast-enhanced studies of experimental myocardial infarction. First, compared to qualitative measurements based on signal intensity changes, they are less sensitive to specific parameter choices, thereby allowing for better comparison between different studies or during longitudinal studies. Secondly, T1 measurements may allow for quantification of local contrast agent concentrations. In this study, a recently developed 3D T1 mapping technique was applied in a mouse model of myocardial infarction to measure differences in myocardial T1 before and after injection of a liposomal contrast agent. This was then used to assess the concentration of accumulated contrast agent. Myocardial ischemia/reperfusion injury was induced in 8 mice by transient ligation of the LAD coronary artery. Baseline quantitative T1 maps were made at day 1 after surgery, followed by injection of a Gd-based liposomal contrast agent. Five mice served as control group, which followed the same protocol without initial surgery. Twenty-four hours post-injection, a second T1 measurement was performed. Local ΔR1 values were compared with regional wall thickening determined by functional cine CMR and correlated to ex vivo Gd concentrations determined by ICP-MS. Compared to control values, pre-contrast T1 of infarcted myocardium was slightly elevated, whereas T1 of remote myocardium did not significantly differ. Twenty-four hours post-contrast injection, high ΔR1 values were found in regions with low wall thickening values. However, compared to remote tissue (wall thickening > 45%), ΔR1 was only significantly higher in severe infarcted tissue (wall thickening < 15%). A substantial correlation (r = 0.81) was found between CMR-based ΔR1 values and Gd concentrations from ex vivo ICP-MS measurements. Furthermore, regression analysis revealed that the effective relaxivity of the liposomal contrast agent was only about half the value determined in vitro. 3D cardiac T1 mapping by CMR can be used to monitor the accumulation of contrast agents in contrast-enhanced studies of murine myocardial infarction. The contrast agent relaxivity was decreased under in vivo conditions compared to in vitro measurements, which needs consideration when quantifying local contrast agent concentrations.

Noncontrast magnetic resonance T1 mapping reflects a composite of both intra- and extracellular signal. We hypothesized that noncontrast T1 mapping can characterize the myocardium beyond that achieved by the well-established late gadolinium enhancement (LGE) technique (which detects focal fibrosis) in both hypertrophic (HCM) and dilated (DCM) cardiomyopathy, by detecting both diffuse and focal fibrosis. Subjects underwent Cardiovascular Magnetic Resonance imaging at 3T (28 HCM, 18 DCM, and 12 normals). Matching short-axis slices were acquired for cine, T1 mapping, and LGE imaging (0.1 mmol/kg). Circumferential strain was measured in the midventricular slice, and (31)P magnetic resonance spectroscopy was acquired for the septum of the midventricular slice. Mean T1 relaxation time was increased in HCM and DCM (HCM 1209±28 ms, DCM 1225±42 ms, normal 1178±13 ms, P<0.05). There was a weak correlation between mean T1 and LGE (r=0.32, P<0.001). T1 values were higher in segments with LGE than in those without (HCM with LGE 1228±41 ms versus no LGE 1192±79 ms, P<0.01; DCM with LGE 1254±73 ms versus no LGE 1217±52 ms, P<0.01). However, in both HCM and DCM, even in segments unaffected by LGE, T1 values were significantly higher than normal (P<0.01). T1 values correlated with disease severity, being increased as wall thickness increased in HCM; conversely, in DCM, T1 values were highest in the thinnest myocardial segments. T1 values also correlated significantly with circumferential strain (r=0.42, P<0.01). Interestingly, this correlation remained statistically significant even for the slices without LGE (r=0.56, P=0.04). Finally, there was also a statistically significant negative correlation between T1 values and phosphocreatine/adenosine triphosphate ratios (r=-0.59, P<0.0001). In HCM and DCM, noncontrast T1 mapping detects underlying disease processes beyond those assessed by LGE in relatively low-risk individuals.

Aortic stenosis (AS) leads to diffuse fibrosis in the myocardium, which is linked to adverse outcome. Myocardial T1 values change with tissue composition. To test the hypothesis that our recently developed non-contrast cardiac magnetic resonance (CMR) T1 mapping sequence could identify myocardial fibrosis without contrast agent. A prospective CMR non-contrast T1 mapping study of 109 patients with moderate and severe AS and 33 age- and gender-matched controls. CMR at 1.5 T, including non-contrast T1 mapping using a shortened modified Look-Locker inversion recovery sequence, was carried out. Biopsy samples for histological assessment of collagen volume fraction (CVF%) were obtained in 19 patients undergoing aortic valve replacement. There was a significant correlation between T1 values and CVF% (r=0.65, p=0.002). Mean T1 values were significantly longer in all groups with severe AS (972 ± 33 ms in severe asymptomatic, 1014 ± 38 ms in severe symptomatic) than in normal controls (944 ± 16 ms) (p<0.05). The strongest associations with T1 values were for aortic valve area (r=-0.40, p=0.001) and left ventricular mass index (LVMI) (r=0.36, p=0.008), and these were the only independent predictors on multivariate analysis. Non-contrast T1 values are increased in patients with severe AS and further increase in symptomatic compared with asymptomatic patients. T1 values lengthened with greater LVMI and correlated with the degree of biopsy-quantified fibrosis. This may provide a useful clinical assessment of diffuse myocardial fibrosis in the future.

Cardiac magnetic resonance (CMR) T1 mapping is an emerging tool for objective quantification of myocardial fibrosis. To (a) establish the feasibility of left atrial (LA) T1 measurements, (b) determine the range of LA T1 values in patients with atrial fibrillation (AF) vs healthy volunteers, and (c) validate T1 mapping vs LA intracardiac electrogram voltage amplitude measures. CMR imaging at 1.5 T was performed in 51 consecutive patients before AF ablation and in 16 healthy volunteers. T1 measurements were obtained from the posterior LA myocardium by using the modified Look-Locker inversion-recovery sequence. Given the established association of reduced electrogram amplitude with fibrosis, intracardiac point-by-point bipolar LA voltage measures were recorded for the validation of T1 measurements. The median LA T1 relaxation time was shorter in patients with AF (387 [interquartile range 364-428] ms) compared to healthy volunteers (459 [interquartile range 418-532] ms; P < .001) and was shorter in patients with AF with prior ablation compared to patients without prior ablation (P = .035). In a generalized estimating equations model, adjusting for data clusters per participant, age, rhythm during CMR, prior ablation, AF type, hypertension, and diabetes, each 100-ms increase in T1 relaxation time was associated with 0.1 mV increase in intracardiac bipolar LA voltage (P = .025). Measurement of the LA myocardium T1 relaxation time is feasible and strongly associated with invasive voltage measures. This methodology may improve the quantification of fibrotic changes in thin-walled myocardial tissues.

To evaluate long-term changes in diffuse myocardial fibrosis using cardiac magnetic resonance (CMR) with late gadolinium enhancement (LGE) and T1 mapping. Patients with chronic stable cardiomyopathy and stable clinical status (n = 52) underwent repeat CMR at a 6 month or greater follow up interval and had LGE and left ventricular (LV) T1 mapping CMR. Diffuse myocardial fibrosis (excluding areas of focal myocardial scar) was assessed by post gadolinium myocardial T1 times. Mean baseline age of 52 patients (66 % male) was 35 ± 19 years with a mean interval between CMR examinations of 2.0 ± 0.8 years. CMR parameters, including LV mass and ejection fraction, showed no change at follow-up CMR (p > 0.05). LVT1 times (excluding focal scar) decreased over the study interval (from 468 ± 106 to 434 ± 82 ms, p = 0.049). 38 Patients had no visual LGE-, while 14 were LGE+. For LGE- patients, greater change in LV mass and end systolic volume index were associated with change in T1 time (β = -2.03 ms/g/m(2), p = 0.035 and β = 2.1 ms/mL/m(2), p = 0.029, respectively). For LGE+ patients, scar size was stable between CMR1 and CMR2 (10.7 ± 13.8 and 11.5 ± 13.9 g, respectively, p = 0.32). These results suggest that diffuse myocardial fibrosis, as assessed by T1 mapping, progresses over time in patients with chronic stable cardiomyopathy.

T(1) maps obtained with modified Look-Locker inversion recovery (MOLLI) can be used to measure myocardial T(1). We aimed to evaluate the potential of MOLLI T(1) mapping for the assessment of acute and chronic myocardial infarction (MI). A total of 24 patients with a first MI underwent MRI within 8 days and after 6 months. T(1) mapping was performed at baseline and at selected intervals between 2-20 min following administration of gadopentetate dimeglumine (Gd-DTPA). Delayed-enhancement (DE) imaging served as the reference standard for delineation of the infarct zone. On T(1) maps the myocardial T(1) relaxation time was assessed in hyperenhanced areas, hypoenhanced infarct cores, and remote myocardium. The planimetric size of myocardial areas with standardized T(1) threshold values was measured. Acute and chronic MI exhibited different T(1) changes. Precontrast threshold T(1) maps detected segmental abnormalities caused by acute MI with 96% sensitivity and 91% specificity. Agreement between measurements of infarct size from T(1) mapping and DE imaging was higher in chronic than in acute infarcts. Precontrast T(1) maps enable the detection of acute MI. Acute and chronic MI show different patterns of T(1) changes. Standardized T(1) thresholds provide the potential to dichotomously identify areas of infarction.

Diffuse myocardial fibrosis, and to a lesser extent global myocardial edema, are important processes in heart disease which are difficult to assess or quantify with cardiovascular magnetic resonance (CMR) using conventional late gadolinium enhancement (LGE) or T1-mapping. Measurement of the myocardial extracellular volume fraction (ECV) circumvents factors that confound T1-weighted images or T1-maps. We hypothesized that quantitative assessment of myocardial ECV would be clinically useful for detecting both focal and diffuse myocardial abnormalities in a variety of common and uncommon heart diseases. A total of 156 subjects were imaged including 62 with normal findings, 33 patients with chronic myocardial infarction (MI), 33 with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM), 15 with non-ischemic dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM), 7 with acute myocarditis, 4 with cardiac amyloidosis, and 2 with systemic capillary leak syndrome (SCLS). Motion corrected ECV maps were generated automatically from T1-maps acquired pre- and post-contrast calibrated by blood hematocrit. Abnormally-elevated ECV was defined as >2SD from the mean ECV in individuals with normal findings. In HCM the size of regions of LGE was quantified as the region >2 SD from remote. Mean ECV of 62 normal individuals was 25.4 ± 2.5% (m ± SD), normal range 20.4%-30.4%. Mean ECV within the core of chronic myocardial infarctions (without MVO) (N=33) measured 68.5 ± 8.6% (p<0.001 vs normal). In HCM, the extent of abnormally elevated ECV correlated to the extent of LGE (r=0.72, p<0.001) but had a systematically greater extent by ECV (mean difference 19 ± 7% of slice). Abnormally elevated ECV was identified in 4 of 16 patients with non-ischemic DCM (38.1 ± 1.9% (p<0.001 vs normal) and LGE in the same slice appeared "normal" in 2 of these 4 patients. Mean ECV values in other disease entities ranged 32-60% for cardiac amyloidosis (N=4), 40-41% for systemic capillary leak syndrome (N=2), and 39-56% within abnormal regions affected by myocarditis (N=7). ECV mapping appears promising to complement LGE imaging in cases of more homogenously diffuse disease. The ability to display ECV maps in units that are physiologically intuitive and may be interpreted on an absolute scale offers the potential for detection of diffuse disease and measurement of the extent and severity of abnormal regions.

The purpose of this study was to investigate a noninvasive method for quantifying diffuse myocardial fibrosis with cardiac magnetic resonance imaging (CMRI). Diffuse myocardial fibrosis is a fundamental process in pathologic remodeling in cardiomyopathy and is postulated to cause increased cardiac stiffness and poor clinical outcomes. Although regional fibrosis is easily imaged with cardiac magnetic resonance, there is currently no noninvasive method for quantifying diffuse myocardial fibrosis. We performed CMRI on 45 subjects (25 patients with heart failure, 20 control patients), on a clinical 1.5-T CMRI scanner. A prototype T(1) mapping sequence was used to calculate the post-contrast myocardial T(1) time as an index of diffuse fibrosis; regional fibrosis was identified by delayed contrast enhancement. Regional and global systolic function was assessed by cine CMRI in standard short- and long-axis planes, with echocardiography used to evaluate diastology. An additional 9 subjects underwent CMRI and endomyocardial biopsy for histologic correlation. Post-contrast myocardial T(1) times correlated histologically with fibrosis (R = -0.7, p = 0.03) and were shorter in heart failure subjects than controls (383 +/- 17 ms vs. 564 +/- 23 ms, p < 0.0001). The T(1) time of heart failure myocardium was shorter than that in controls even when excluding areas of regional fibrosis (429 +/- 22 ms vs. 564 +/- 23 ms, p < 0.0001). The post-contrast myocardial T(1) time shortened as diastolic function worsened (562 +/- 24 ms in normal diastolic function vs. 423 +/- 33 ms in impaired diastolic function vs. 368 +/- 20 ms in restrictive function, p < 0.001). Contrast-enhanced CMRI T(1) mapping identifies changes in myocardial T(1) times in heart failure, which appear to reflect diffuse fibrosis.

This study sought to test the diagnostic performance of native T1 mapping in acute myocarditis compared with cardiac magnetic resonance (CMR) techniques such as dark-blood T2-weighted (T2W)-CMR, bright-blood T2W-CMR, and late gadolinium enhancement (LGE) imaging. The diagnosis of acute myocarditis on CMR often requires multiple techniques, including T2W, early gadolinium enhancement, and LGE imaging. Novel techniques such as T1 mapping and bright-blood T2W-CMR are also sensitive to changes in free water content. We hypothesized that these techniques can serve as new and potentially superior diagnostic criteria for myocarditis. We investigated 50 patients with suspected acute myocarditis (age 42 ± 16 years; 22% women) and 45 controls (age 42 ± 14 years; 22% women). CMR at 1.5-T (median 3 days from presentation) included: 1) dark-blood T2W-CMR (short-tau inversion recovery); 2) bright-blood T2W-CMR (acquisition for cardiac unified T2 edema); 3) native T1 mapping (shortened modified look-locker inversion recovery); and 4) LGE. Image analysis included: 1) global T2 signal intensity ratio of myocardium compared with skeletal muscle; 2) myocardial T1 relaxation times; and 3) areas of LGE. Compared with controls, patients had significantly higher global T2 signal intensity ratios by dark-blood T2W-CMR (1.73 ± 0.27 vs. 1.56 ± 0.15, p < 0.01), bright-blood T2W-CMR (2.02 ± 0.33 vs. 1.84 ± 0.17, p < 0.01), and mean myocardial T1 (1,010 ± 65 ms vs. 941 ± 18 ms, p < 0.01). Receiver-operating characteristic analysis showed clear differences in diagnostic performance. The areas under the curve for each method were: T1 mapping (0.95), LGE (0.96), dark-blood T2 (0.78), and bright-blood T2 (0.76). A T1 cutoff of 990 ms had a sensitivity, specificity, and diagnostic accuracy of 90%, 91%, and 91%, respectively. Native T1 mapping as a novel criterion for the detection of acute myocarditis showed excellent and superior diagnostic performance compared with T2W-CMR. It also has a higher sensitivity compared with T2W and LGE techniques, which may be especially useful in detecting subtle focal disease and when gadolinium contrast imaging is not feasible.

Cardiac magnetic resonance (CMR) T1 mapping has been used to characterize myocardial diffuse fibrosis. The aim of this study is to determine the reproducibility and sample size of CMR fibrosis measurements that would be applicable in clinical trials. A modified Look-Locker with inversion recovery (MOLLI) sequence was used to determine myocardial T1 values pre-, and 12 and 25min post-administration of a gadolinium-based contrast agent at 3 Tesla. For 24 healthy subjects (8 men; 29 ± 6 years), two separate scans were obtained a) with a bolus of 0.15mmol/kg of gadopentate dimeglumine and b) 0.1mmol/kg of gadobenate dimeglumine, respectively, with averaged of 51 ± 34 days between two scans. Separately, 25 heart failure subjects (12 men; 63 ± 14 years), were evaluated after a bolus of 0.15mmol/kg of gadopentate dimeglumine. Myocardial partition coefficient (λ) was calculated according to (ΔR1myocardium/ΔR1blood), and ECV was derived from λ by adjusting (1-hematocrit). Mean ECV and λ were both significantly higher in HF subjects than healthy (ECV: 0.287 ± 0.034 vs. 0.267 ± 0.028, p=0.002; λ: 0.481 ± 0.052 vs. 442 ± 0.037, p < 0.001, respectively). The inter-study ECV and λ variation were about 2.8 times greater than the intra-study ECV and λ variation in healthy subjects (ECV:0.017 vs. 0.006, λ:0.025 vs. 0.009, respectively). The estimated sample size to detect ECV change of 0.038 or λ change of 0.063 (corresponding to ~3% increase of histological myocardial fibrosis) with a power of 80% and an alpha error of 0.05 for heart failure subjects using a two group design was 27 in each group, respectively. ECV and λ quantification have a low variability across scans, and could be a viable tool for evaluating clinical trial outcome.

The diagnosis of myocarditis can be challenging given that symptoms, clinical exam findings, electrocardiogram results, biomarkers, and echocardiogram results are often non-specific. Endocardial biopsy is an established method for diagnosing myocarditis, but carries the risk of complications and false negative results. Cardiac magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) has become the primary non-invasive imaging tool in patients with suspected myocarditis. Myocarditis can be diagnosed by using three tissue markers including edema, hyperemia/capillary leak, and necrosis/fibrosis. The interpretation of cardiac MR findings can be confusing, especially when the myocardium is diffusely involved. Using T1 and T2 maps, the diagnosis of myocarditis can be made even in cases of global myocarditis with the help of quantitative analysis. We herein describe a case of acute global myocarditis which was diagnosed by using quantitative T1 and T2 mapping.

Magnetic resonance as an imaging modality provides an excellent soft tissue differentiation, which is an ideal choice for cardiac imaging. Cardiac magnetic resonance (CMR) allows myocardial tissue characterization, as well as comprehensive evaluation of the structures. Although late gadolinium enhancement after injection of the gadolinium extracellular contrast agent has further extended our ability to characterize the myocardial tissue, it also has limitations in the quantification of enhanced myocardial tissue pathology, and the detection of diffuse myocardial disease, which is not easily recognized by enhancement contrast. Recently, the remarkable advances in CMR technique, such as T1 mapping, which can quantitatively evaluate myocardial status, showed potentials to overcome limitations of existing CMR sequences and to expand the application of CMR. This article will review the technical and clinical points to be considered in the practical use of pre- and post-contrast T1 mapping.

Pixel-by-pixel calculation of T1 values (T1 mapping) has been used in different tissues to focus on T1 changes in a quantitative fashion. The aim of this study was to establish T1 mapping of human myocardium on a 1.5 Tesla system and to examine its diagnostic potential in patients with acute myocardial infarction (AMI). 8 patients with reperfused AMI (day 3 +/- 1) underwent multi-breath-hold MRI in a 1.5 Tesla system. Sets of five images with varying T1 weighting were acquired prior to and after the administration of contrast agent to generate images from calculated T1 values (T1 mapping). Prior to the contrast agent administration, all patients showed T1 prolongation in the area of infarction, which was identified in separate measurements using the delayed enhancement approach. Compared to noninfarcted areas, T1 values in the infarcted areas were increased by 18 +/- 7% (SE, p < 0.05). The spatial extent of the area of T1 prolongation was larger than that of the hyper-enhanced areas in conventional contrast-enhanced images. T1 maps obtained after the application of Gadolinium-DTPA revealed a T1 reduction of 27 +/- 4% in infarcted tissue compared to noninfarcted areas (p < 0.05). The areas showing T1 reduction were in agreement with the hyper-enhanced regions in conventional T1-weighted images. T1 mapping visualizes changes in the longitudinal relaxation time induced by AMI. T1 mapping can detect myocardial necrosis without the use of contrast media. Information that can be extracted from a combination of pre- and postcontrast T1 maps exceeds that from conventional contrast studies.

Direct measurement of the longitudinal relaxation time T1 provides objective and quantitative diagnostic information. However, current T1 mapping methods are generally time consuming without the aid of fast imaging. This study used a model-based compressed sensing method for fast cardiac T1 mapping in small animals. Based on the physics of magnetization recovery, the aliasing artifact associated with under-sampling was removed by exploiting the sparsity of the signals in the T1 recovery direction. Simulation study was performed to evaluate the reconstruction accuracy under various experimental conditions. Several approaches that accounted for phase variations were compared for optimized reconstruction in the phantom study. In vivo validation was performed on a cardiac manganese-enhanced MRI study using mice. Accurate reconstruction of the under-sampled images and the resulting T1 maps were achieved in both simulation and MRI studies on phantom and in vivo mice. These results suggest that the current compressed sensing method allows fast (<80 s) T1 mapping of the mouse heart at high spatial resolution (234×469 μm2).

Current cardiovascular magnetic resonance (CMR) methods, such as late gadolinium enhancement (LGE) and oedema imaging (T2W) used to depict myocardial ischemia, have limitations. Novel quantitative T1-mapping techniques have the potential to further characterize the components of ischemic injury. In patients with myocardial infarction (MI) we sought to investigate whether state-of the art pre-contrast T1-mapping (1) detects acute myocardial injury, (2) allows for quantification of the severity of damage when compared to standard techniques such as LGE and T2W, and (3) has the ability to predict long term functional recovery. 3T CMR including T2W, T1-mapping and LGE was performed in 41 patients [of these, 78% were ST elevation MI (STEMI)] with acute MI at 12-48 hour after chest pain onset and at 6 months (6M). Patients with STEMI underwent primary PCI prior to CMR. Assessment of acute regional wall motion abnormalities, acute segmental damaged fraction by T2W and LGE and mean segmental T1 values was performed on matching short axis slices. LGE and improvement in regional wall motion at 6M were also obtained. We found that the variability of T1 measurements was significantly lower compared to T2W and that, while the diagnostic performance of acute T1-mapping for detecting myocardial injury was at least as good as that of T2W-CMR in STEMI patients, it was superior to T2W imaging in NSTEMI. There was a significant relationship between the segmental damaged fraction assessed by either by LGE or T2W, and mean segmental T1 values (P < 0.01). The index of salvaged myocardium derived by acute T1-mapping and 6M LGE was not different to the one derived from T2W (P = 0.88). Furthermore, the likelihood of improvement of segmental function at 6M decreased progressively as acute T1 values increased (P < 0.0004). In acute MI, pre-contrast T1-mapping allows assessment of the extent of myocardial damage. T1-mapping might become an important complementary technique to LGE and T2W for identification of reversible myocardial injury and prediction of functional recovery in acute MI.

Patients with myotonic muscular dystrophy (DM) are at risk for atrioventricular block and left ventricular (LV) dysfunction. Noninvasive detection of diffuse myocardial fibrosis may improve disease management in this population. To define functional and postcontrast myocardial T1 time cardiac magnetic resonance characteristics in patients with DM. Thirty-three patients with DM (24 with type 1 and 9 with type 2) and 13 healthy volunteers underwent cardiac magnetic resonance for the assessment of LV indices and the evaluation of diffuse myocardial fibrosis by T1 mapping. The association of myocardial T1 time with electrocardiogram abnormalities and LV indices was examined among patients with DM. Patients with DM had lower end-diastolic volume index (68.9 mL/m(2) vs 60.3 mL/m(2); P = .045) and cardiac index (2.7 L/min/m(2) vs 2.33 L/min/m(2); P = .005) and shorter myocardial T1 time (394.5 ms vs 441.4 ms; P < .0001) than did control subjects. Among patients with DM, there was a positive association between higher T1 time and LV mass index (2.2 ms longer per g/m(2); P = .006), LV end-diastolic volume index (1.3 ms longer per mL/m(2); P = .026), filtered QRS duration (1.2 ms longer per unit; P = .005), and low-amplitude (<40 mcV) late-potential duration (0.9 ms longer per unit; P = .01). Using multivariate random effects regression, each 10-ms increase in myocardial T1 time of patients with type 1 DM was independently associated with 1.3-ms increase in longitudinal PR and QRS intervals during follow-up. DM is associated with structural alterations on cardiac magnetic resonance. Postcontrast myocardial T1 time was shorter in patients with DM than in controls, likely reflecting the presence of diffuse myocardial fibrosis.

Cardiac magnetic resonance (MR) imaging is currently considered the gold standard for characterizing changes in myocardial structure, in particular to assess myocardial edema and focal fibrosis. In spite of this potential capability, the traditional MR sequences usually employed for these purposes have significant limitations and provide only qualitative information. Recent developments in cardiac MR imaging techniques currently provide clinically-feasible mapping of T1 and T2 relaxation times, thus providing a quantitative assessment of the parameters of interest. Myocardial edema can be evaluated using T2 mapping techniques. These have shown a superior performance compared to the traditional T2-weighted and STIR sequences, both in acute inflammatory cardiomyopathies and in acute ischemic injury. T1 mapping techniques, performed both with and without contrast medium, enable to quantify diffuse myocardial fibrosis and to assess myocardial edema and infiltration. This article will review current methodologies for cardiac T1 and T2 parametric mapping and their potential and limitations in the assessment of myocardial damage.

Cardiac magnetic resonance imaging (CMR) is well established and considered the gold standard for assessing myocardial volumes and function, and for quantifying myocardial fibrosis in both ischemic and nonischemic heart disease. Recent developments in CMR imaging techniques are enabling clinically-feasible rapid parametric mapping of myocardial perfusion and magnetic relaxation properties (T1, T2, and T2* relaxation times) that are further expanding the range of unique tissue parameters that can be assessed using CMR. To generate a parametric map of perfusion or relaxation times, multiple images of the same region of the myocardium are acquired with different sensitivity to the parameter of interest, and the signal intensities of these images are fit to a model which describes the underlying physiology or relaxation parameters. The parametric map is an image of the fitted perfusion parameters or relaxation times. Parametric mapping requires acquisition of multiple images typically within a breath-hold and thus requires specialized rapid acquisition techniques. Quantitative perfusion imaging techniques can more accurately determine the extent of myocardial ischemia in coronary artery disease and provide the opportunity to evaluate microvascular disease with CMR. T1 mapping techniques performed both with and without contrast are enabling quantification of diffuse myocardial fibrosis and myocardial infiltration. Myocardial edema and inflammation can be evaluated using T2 mapping techniques. T2* mapping provides an assessment of myocardial iron-overload and myocardial hemorrhage. There is a growing body of evidence for the clinical utility of quantitative assessment of perfusion and relaxation times, although current techniques still have some important limitations. This article will review the current imaging technologies for parametric mapping, emerging applications, current limitations, and potential of CMR parametric mapping of the myocardium. The specific focus will be the assessment and quantification of myocardial perfusion and magnetic relaxation times.

Cardiac magnetic resonance (CMR) imaging is a well-established noninvasive imaging modality in clinical cardiology. Its unsurpassed accuracy in defining cardiac morphology and function and its ability to provide tissue characterization make it well suited for the study of patients with cardiac diseases. Late gadolinium enhancement was a major advancement in the development of tissue characterization techniques, allowing the unique ability of CMR to differentiate ischemic heart disease from nonischemic cardiomyopathies. Using T2-weighted techniques, areas of edema and inflammation can be identified in the myocardium. A new generation of myocardial mapping techniques are emerging, enabling direct quantitative assessment of myocardial tissue properties in absolute terms. This review will summarize recent developments involving T1-mapping and T2-mapping techniques and focus on the clinical applications and future potential of these evolving CMR methodologies.

Even though intra-cardiac cystic lesions are extremely unusual in adults, they should be considered in the differential diagnosis of patients presenting with valvular masses. Cardiac magnetic resonance imaging has emerged as modality of choice for non-invasive characterization of cardiac masses. We report a case of an intra-cardiac mass of the mitral valve in a 51-year old male, detected by echocardiography after transient ischemic attack and retinal artery occlusion. Cardiac magnetic resonance (CMR) imaging was performed at 3 T to evaluate and characterize the lesion prior to surgery. Diagnosis of a calcified left-ventricular pseudocyst of the mitral valve was confirmed by histological evaluation. This case presents the unusual finding of contrast uptake in an intra-cardiac cystic lesion and points to the potential of T1 and T2 mapping for assisting in the characterization and diagnosis of intra-cardiac masses by CMR.

To develop an arrhythmia-insensitive rapid (AIR) cardiac T1 mapping pulse sequence for quantification of diffuse fibrosis. An arrhythmia-insensitive cardiac T1 mapping pulse sequence was developed based on saturation recovery T1 weighting, which is inherently insensitive to heart rate and rhythm, and two single-shot balanced steady-state free precession image acquisitions with centric k-space ordering, where T1 calculation is inherently insensitive to T2 effects. Its performance against conventional cardiac T1 mapping based on inversion recovery (i.e., MOLLI) is compared. Phantom experiments (T1 ranging from 535 to 2123 ms) were performed with heart rate and rhythm simulated at 60 and 120 beats per minute (bpm) and arrhythmia using an external triggering device. Ten human subjects and 17 large animals were scanned precontrast and 5, 10, and 15 min after contrast agent administration. Compared with the reference T1 mapping, AIR yielded lower normalized root-mean-square error than MOLLI (8% vs. 3%, respectively, at 60 bpm, 28% vs. 3%, respectively, at 120 bpm, and 22% vs. 3%, respectively, at arrhythmia). In vivo studies showed that T1 measurements made by MOLLI and AIR were strongly correlated (r = 0.99) but in poor agreement (mean difference = 161.8 ms, upper and lower 95% limits of agreements = 347.5 ms and -24.0 ms). Our AIR pulse sequence may be clinically useful for assessment of diffuse myocardial fibrosis in patients.

Cardiovascular magnetic resonance (CMR) T1 mapping indices, such as T1 time and partition coefficient (λ), have shown potential to assess diffuse myocardial fibrosis. The purpose of this study was to investigate how scanner and field strength variation affect the accuracy and precision/reproducibility of T1 mapping indices. CMR studies were performed on two 1.5T and three 3T scanners. Eight phantoms were made to mimic the T1/T2 of pre- and post-contrast myocardium and blood at 1.5T and 3T. T1 mapping using MOLLI was performed with simulated heart rate of 40-100 bpm. Inversion recovery spin echo (IR-SE) was the reference standard for T1 determination. Accuracy was defined as the percent error between MOLLI and IR-SE, and scan/re-scan reproducibility was defined as the relative percent mean difference between repeat MOLLI scans. Partition coefficient was estimated by ΔR1myocardium phantom/ΔR1blood phantom. Generalized linear mixed model was used to compare the accuracy and precision/reproducibility of T1 and λ across field strength, scanners, and protocols. Field strength significantly affected MOLLI T1 accuracy (6.3% error for 1.5T vs. 10.8% error for 3T, p<0.001) but not λ accuracy (8.8% error for 1.5T vs. 8.0% error for 3T, p=0.11). Partition coefficients of MOLLI were not different between two 1.5T scanners (47.2% vs. 47.9%, p=0.13), and showed only slight variation across three 3T scanners (49.2% vs. 49.8% vs. 49.9%, p=0.016). Partition coefficient also had significantly lower percent error for precision (better scan/re-scan reproducibility) than measurement of individual T1 values (3.6% for λ vs. 4.3%-4.8% for T1 values, approximately, for pre/post blood and myocardium values). Based on phantom studies, T1 errors using MOLLI ranged from 6-14% across various MR scanners while errors for partition coefficient were less (6-10%). Compared with absolute T1 times, partition coefficient showed less variability across platforms and field strengths as well as higher precision.

Rapid innovations in cardiovascular magnetic resonance (CMR) now permit the routine acquisition of quantitative measures of myocardial and blood T1 which are key tissue characteristics. These capabilities introduce a new frontier in cardiology, enabling the practitioner/investigator to quantify biologically important myocardial properties that otherwise can be difficult to ascertain clinically. CMR may be able to track biologically important changes in the myocardium by: a) native T1 that reflects myocardial disease involving the myocyte and interstitium without use of gadolinium based contrast agents (GBCA), or b) the extracellular volume fraction (ECV)-a direct GBCA-based measurement of the size of the extracellular space, reflecting interstitial disease. The latter technique attempts to dichotomize the myocardium into its cellular and interstitial components with estimates expressed as volume fractions. This document provides recommendations for clinical and research T1 and ECV measurement, based on published evidence when available and expert consensus when not. We address site preparation, scan type, scan planning and acquisition, quality control, visualisation and analysis, technical development. We also address controversies in the field. While ECV and native T1 mapping appear destined to affect clinical decision making, they lack multi-centre application and face significant challenges, which demand a community-wide approach among stakeholders. At present, ECV and native T1 mapping appear sufficiently robust for many diseases; yet more research is required before a large-scale application for clinical decision-making can be recommended.

This study sought to explore the potential role of noncontrast myocardial T1 mapping for detection of cardiac involvement in patients with primary amyloid light-chain (AL) amyloidosis. Cardiac involvement carries a poor prognosis in systemic AL amyloidosis. Late gadolinium enhancement (LGE) cardiac magnetic resonance (CMR) is useful for the detection of cardiac amyloid, but characteristic LGE patterns do not always occur or they appear late in the disease. Noncontrast characterization of amyloidotic myocardium with T1 mapping may improve disease detection. Furthermore, quantitative assessment of myocardial amyloid load would be of great value. Fifty-three AL amyloidosis patients (14 with no cardiac involvement, 11 with possible involvement, and 28 with definite cardiac involvement based on standard biomarker and echocardiographic criteria) underwent CMR (1.5-T) including noncontrast T1 mapping (shortened modified look-locker inversion recovery [ShMOLLI] sequence) and LGE imaging. These were compared with 36 healthy volunteers and 17 patients with aortic stenosis and a comparable degree of left ventricular hypertrophy as the cardiac amyloid patients. Myocardial T1 was significantly elevated in cardiac AL amyloidosis patients (1,140 ± 61 ms) compared to normal subjects (958 ± 20 ms, p < 0.001) and patients with aortic stenosis (979 ± 51 ms, p < 0.001). Myocardial T1 was increased in AL amyloid even when cardiac involvement was uncertain (1,048 ± 48 ms) or thought absent (1,009 ± 31 ms). A noncontrast myocardial T1 cutoff of 1,020 ms yielded 92% accuracy for identifying amyloid patients with possible or definite cardiac involvement. In the AL amyloidosis cohort, there were significant correlations between myocardial T1 time and indices of systolic and diastolic dysfunction. Noncontrast T1 mapping has high diagnostic accuracy for detecting cardiac AL amyloidosis, correlates well with markers of systolic and diastolic dysfunction, and is potentially more sensitive for detecting early disease than LGE imaging. Elevated myocardial T1 may represent a direct marker of cardiac amyloid load. Further studies are needed to assess the prognostic significance of T1 elevation.

Late enhancement imaging is used to diagnose and characterize a wide range of ischemic and nonischemic cardiomyopathies, and its use has become ubiquitous in the cardiac MR exam. As the use of late enhancement imaging has matured and the span of applications has widened, the demands on image quality have grown. The characterization of subendocardial MI now includes the accurate quantification of scar size, shape, and characterization of borders which have been shown to have prognostic significance. More diverse patterns of late enhancement including patchy, mid-wall, subepicardial, or diffuse enhancement are of interest in diagnosing nonischemic cardiomyopathies. As clinicians are examining late enhancement images for more subtle indication of fibrosis, the demand for lower artifacts has increased. A range of new techniques have emerged to improve the speed and quality of late enhancement imaging including: methods for acquisition during free breathing, and fat water separated imaging for characterizing fibrofatty infiltration and reduction of artifacts related to the presence of fat. Methods for quantification of T1 and extracellular volume fraction are emerging to tackle the issue of discriminating globally diffuse fibrosis from normal healthy tissue which is challenging using conventional late enhancement methods. The aim of this review will be to describe the current state of the art and to provide a guide to various clinical protocols that are commonly used.

The aim of this study was to examine the value of native and post-contrast T1 relaxation in the differentiation between healthy and diffusely diseased myocardium in 2 model conditions, hypertrophic cardiomyopathy and nonischemic dilated cardiomyopathy. T1 mapping has been proposed as potentially valuable in the quantitative assessment of diffuse myocardial fibrosis, but no studies to date have systematically evaluated its role in the differentiation of healthy myocardium from diffuse disease in a clinical setting. Consecutive subjects undergoing routine clinical cardiac magnetic resonance at King's College London were invited to participate in this study. Groups were based on cardiac magnetic resonance findings and consisted of subjects with known hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (n = 25) and nonischemic dilated cardiomyopathy (n = 27). Thirty normotensive subjects with low pre-test likelihood of cardiomyopathy, not taking any regular medications and with normal cardiac magnetic resonance findings including normal left ventricular mass indexes, served as controls. Single equatorial short-axis slice T1 mapping was performed using a 3-T scanner before and at 10, 20, and 30 minutes after the administration of 0.2 mmol/kg of gadobutrol. T1 values were quantified within the septal myocardium (T1 native), and extracellular volume fractions (ECV) were calculated. T1 native was significantly longer in patients with cardiomyopathy compared with control subjects (p < 0.01). Conversely, post-contrast T1 values were significantly shorter in patients with cardiomyopathy at all time points (p < 0.01). ECV was significantly higher in patients with cardiomyopathy compared with controls at all time points (p < 0.01). Multivariate binary logistic regression revealed that T1 native could differentiate between healthy and diseased myocardium with sensitivity of 100%, specificity of 96%, and diagnostic accuracy of 98% (area under the curve 0.99; 95% confidence interval: 0.96 to 1.00; p < 0.001), whereas post-contrast T1 values and ECV showed lower discriminatory performance. This study demonstrates that native and post-contrast T1 values provide indexes with high diagnostic accuracy for the discrimination of normal and diffusely diseased myocardium.
