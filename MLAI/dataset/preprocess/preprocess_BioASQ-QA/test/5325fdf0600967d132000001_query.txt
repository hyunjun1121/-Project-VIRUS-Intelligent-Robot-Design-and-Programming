To evaluate retrospectively the objective and subjective parameters in 42 male patients who underwent bone anchored sub-urethral sling positioning (BAUS) for SUI (stress urinary incontinence) due to ISD (intrinsic sphincter deficiency). Patients with SUI due to radical retropubic prostatectomy (36 patients), transurethral resection of prostate (5 patients) and open simple prostatectomy (1 patient) underwent BAUS positioning between July 1999 and September 2005 (mean FU = 41 months). Before and after surgery, the patients were evaluated by physical examination, urethrocystoscopy, urodynamics, 1 h pad test and QoL questionnaire. Surgical technique involved perineal implantation to the pubic rami using four anchors of a sub-urethral sling made of synthetic (26 patients), biological (4 patients) or mixed (12 patients) material. Patients were stratified into three groups: (1) Cured: dry patients at stress test, pad weight 0-1 g. (2) Improved: patients with mild-moderate incontinence, pad weight 2-50 g. (3) Failed: unchanged patients, pad weight > 50 g. At the final follow-up visit cured, improved and failed patients were 26 (62%), 4 (8%) and 12 (30%), respectively. Mean pad weight significantly decreased from 104.6 to 47.3 g (55%) and mean total questionnaire score significantly increased to 50.7 (66%). Mean ALPP significantly increased to 50.4 cmH2O (44.8%). Better results were seen with synthetic slings. Main complications were perineal pain (76%), detrusor overactivity (12%) and sling infection (4.8%). BAUS implantation is a safe, effective, minimally invasive option for iatrogenic male incontinence due to ISD. It compares favourably with AUS.

We retrospectively report objective and subjective outcomes in 40 male patients who underwent bone anchored suburethral synthetic sling positioning for stress urinary incontinence due to intrinsic sphincter deficiency. Patients with stress urinary incontinence due to radical retropubic prostatectomy (32), robot assisted laparoscopic prostatectomy (3) and transurethral prostate resection (5) underwent bone anchored suburethral synthetic sling positioning between December 2002 and December 2007. Mean followup was 35.2 months (range 2 to 62). Previous anti-incontinence procedures, radiotherapy and transurethral procedures due to urethral stricture were performed in 5, 11 and 5 patients, respectively. Before and after surgery patients were evaluated by physical examination, urethral cystoscopy, urodynamics, a 1-hour pad test and a quality of life questionnaire. Patients were stratified into 3 groups, including group 1-cured (dry with a pad weight of 0 to 1 gm), group 2-improved (mild to moderate incontinence with a pad weight of 2 to 50 gm) and group 3-failed (patient condition unchanged with a pad weight of greater than 50 gm). At the final followup visit 22 (55%), 5 (12.5%) and 13 patients (32.5%) were cured, improved and failed, respectively. Mean pad weight significantly decreased to 51.3 gm in 54% of cases, while the mean total questionnaire score significantly increased to 72.9 in 65% and abdominal leak point pressure significantly increased to 92.5 cm H(2)O in 52%. Statistical analysis showed a significant association between preoperative radiotherapy and treatment failure (85% of patients). Complications were perineal pain in 73% of cases, detrusor overactivity in 5% and sling infection in 15%. The bone anchored suburethral synthetic sling is a simple and attractive procedure that can produce immediate good results with low morbidity, especially when strictly selected patients are treated. Radiotherapy remains a strong predictor of failure.

The increasing number of prostatectomies entails an increasing number of patients suffering from iatrogenic incontinence despite improved surgical techniques. The severity of this problem often requires invasive treatments such as periurethral injection of bulking agents, artificial urinary sphincter (AUS) implantation, and sub-urethral sling positioning. The artificial urethral sphincter has represented, until today, the gold standard but, in the recent years, sling systems have been investigated as minimally invasive alternative options. Today, three different sling procedures are commonly performed: bone-anchored, readjustable, and trans-obturator slings systems. The aim of this review is to critically report the current status of sling systems in the treatment of iatrogenic male incontinence. MEDLINE and PubMed databases were searched and all articles between 1974 and 2009 were evaluated. With regard to bone-anchored, readjustable, and trans-obturator slings systems, cure rates ranged between 58.0% and 86.0%, 55.5% and 73.0%, and 40.0% and 63.0%, respectively, while major complication rates ranged between 0 and 14.5%, 10.0 and 22.2%, and 0 and 10.0%, respectively. Suburethral slings are the only alternative techniques which can be favorably compared with the AUS, showing more advantages with respect to AUS implantations which are mainly represented by a quick and less invasive approach, low morbidity, and low costs. In spite of the difficulty in identifying the most effective sling procedure, overall, sling systems can be recommended for patients with persistent mild or moderate incontinence. However, the indication can also be extended to patients with severe incontinence, after appropriate counseling, allowing AUS implantation in the event of sling failure.

Male Stress Urinary Incontinence (SUI) is an increasingly recognized problem particularly after the treatment of prostate cancer. Postprostatectomy incontinence is a major problem that needs to be solved, since it has great impact on quality of life affecting the patient's physical activity and social well-being. The initial treatment for SUI that persists after 12 months consists of conservative measures such as pelvic floor muscle exercises and behavioral therapy. Properly selected and informed patients can also be treated efficiently with minimally invasive procedures such as the implantation of a male suburethral sling, although the experience with such devices is not extensive. However, the implantation of artificial urinary sphincter is the gold standard therapy.
