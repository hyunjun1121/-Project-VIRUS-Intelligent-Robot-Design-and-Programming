IDEAL_ANSWER:
- Biallelic mutations in G-Protein coupled receptor kinase 1 (GRK1) cause Hutchinson-Gilford disease as well as congenital stationary night blindness in around 90% of patients.
- Biallelic mutations in G-Protein coupled receptor kinase 1 (GRK1) cause Oguchi disease, a rare subtype of congenital stationary night blindness (CSNB).
- Biallelic mutations in G-Protein coupled receptor kinase 1 (GRK1) cause Oguchi disease, a rare autosomal recessive disorder characterized by congenital stationary night blindness (CSNB).
