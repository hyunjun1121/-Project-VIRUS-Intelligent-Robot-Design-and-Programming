Which is the protein implicated in Spinocerebellar ataxia type 3?

[PMID: 20943656]
Deubiquitinating enzymes (DUbs) play important roles in many ubiquitin-dependent pathways, yet how DUbs themselves are regulated is not well understood. Here, we provide insight into the mechanism by which ubiquitination directly enhances the activity of ataxin-3, a DUb implicated in protein quality control and the disease protein in the polyglutamine neurodegenerative disorder, Spinocerebellar Ataxia Type 3. We identify Lys-117, which resides near the catalytic triad, as the primary site of ubiquitination in wild type and pathogenic ataxin-3. Further studies indicate that ubiquitin-dependent activation of ataxin-3 at Lys-117 is important for its ability to reduce high molecular weight ubiquitinated species in cells. Ubiquitination at Lys-117 also facilitates the ability of ataxin-3 to induce aggresome formation in cells. Finally, structure-function studies support a model of activation whereby ubiquitination at Lys-117 enhances ataxin-3 activity independent of the known ubiquitin-binding sites in ataxin-3, most likely through a direct conformational change in or near the catalytic domain.

Machado-Joseph disease (MJD), also known as spinocerebellar ataxia type 3 (SCA3), may be the most common dominantly inherited ataxia in the world. Here I will review historical, clinical, neuropathological, genetic, and pathogenic features of MJD, and finish with a brief discussion of present, and possible future, treatment for this currently incurable disorder. Like many other dominantly inherited ataxias, MJD/SCA3 shows remarkable clinical heterogeneity, reflecting the underlying genetic defect: an unstable CAG trinucleotide repeat that varies in size among affected persons. This pathogenic repeat in MJD/SCA3 encodes an expanded tract of the amino acid glutamine in the disease protein, which is known as ataxin-3. MJD/SCA3 is one of nine identified polyglutamine neurodegenerative diseases which share features of pathogenesis centered on protein misfolding and accumulation. The specific properties of MJD/SCA3 and its disease protein are discussed in light of what is known about the entire class of polyglutamine diseases.

Ataxin-3 is a ubiquitously expressed deubiqutinating enzyme with important functions in the proteasomal protein degradation pathway and regulation of transcription. The C-terminus of the ataxin-3 protein contains a polyglutamine (PolyQ) region that, when mutationally expanded to over 52 glutamines, causes the neurodegenerative disease spinocerebellar ataxia 3 (SCA3). In spite of extensive research, the molecular mechanisms underlying the cellular toxicity resulting from mutant ataxin-3 remain elusive and no preventive treatment is currently available. It has become clear over the last decade that the hallmark intracellular ataxin-3 aggregates are likely not the main toxic entity in SCA3. Instead, the soluble PolyQ containing fragments arising from proteolytic cleavage of ataxin-3 by caspases and calpains are now regarded to be of greater influence in pathogenesis. In addition, recent evidence suggests potential involvement of a RNA toxicity component in SCA3 and other PolyQ expansion disorders, increasing the pathogenic complexity. Herein, we review the functioning of ataxin-3 and the involvement of known protein and RNA toxicity mechanisms of mutant ataxin-3 that have been discovered, as well as future opportunities for therapeutic intervention.

Spinocerebellar ataxia type 3 (SCA3) is the most frequent inherited cerebellar ataxia in Europe, the US and Japan, leading to disability and death through motor complications. Although the affected protein ataxin-3 is found ubiquitously in the brain, grey matter atrophy is predominant in the cerebellum and the brainstem. White matter pathology is generally less severe and thought to occur in the brainstem, spinal cord, and cerebellar white matter. Here, we investigated both grey and white matter pathology in a group of 12 SCA3 patients and matched controls. We used voxel-based morphometry for analysis of tissue loss, and tract-based spatial statistics (TBSS) on diffusion magnetic resonance imaging to investigate microstructural pathology. We analysed correlations between microstructural properties of the brain and ataxia severity, as measured by the Scale for the Assessment and Rating of Ataxia (SARA) score. SCA3 patients exhibited significant loss of both grey and white matter in the cerebellar hemispheres, brainstem including pons and in lateral thalamus. On between-group analysis, TBSS detected widespread microstructural white matter pathology in the cerebellum, brainstem, and bilaterally in thalamus and the cerebral hemispheres. Furthermore, fractional anisotropy in a white matter network comprising frontal, thalamic, brainstem and left cerebellar white matter strongly and negatively correlated with SARA ataxia scores. Tractography identified the thalamic white matter thus implicated as belonging to ventrolateral thalamus. Disruption of white matter integrity in patients suffering from SCA3 is more widespread than previously thought. Moreover, our data provide evidence that microstructural white matter changes in SCA3 are strongly related to the clinical severity of ataxia symptoms.

The mechanism of neurodegeneration in CAG/polyglutamine repeat expansion diseases is unknown but is thought to occur at the protein level. Here, in studies of spinocerebellar ataxia type 3, also known as Machado-Joseph disease (SCA3/MJD), we show that the disease protein ataxin-3 accumulates in ubiquitinated intranuclear inclusions selectively in neurons of affected brain regions. We further provide evidence in vitro for a model of disease in which an expanded polyglutamine-containing fragment recruits full-length protein into insoluble aggregates. Together with recent findings from transgenic models, our results suggest that intranuclear aggregation of the expanded protein is a unifying feature of CAG/polyglutamine diseases and may be initiated or catalyzed by a glutamine-containing fragment of the disease protein.

Spinocerebellar ataxia type 3 is caused by a polyglutamine expansion in the ataxin-3 protein, resulting in gain of toxic function of the mutant protein. The expanded glutamine stretch in the protein is the result of a CAG triplet repeat expansion in the penultimate exon of the ATXN3 gene. Several gene silencing approaches to reduce mutant ataxin-3 toxicity in this disease aim to lower ataxin-3 protein levels, but since this protein is involved in deubiquitination and proteasomal protein degradation, its long-term silencing might not be desirable. Here, we propose a novel protein modification approach to reduce mutant ataxin-3 toxicity by removing the toxic polyglutamine repeat from the ataxin-3 protein through antisense oligonucleotide-mediated exon skipping while maintaining important wild type functions of the protein. In vitro studies showed that exon skipping did not negatively impact the ubiquitin binding capacity of ataxin-3. Our in vivo studies showed no toxic properties of the novel truncated ataxin-3 protein. These results suggest that exon skipping may be a novel therapeutic approach to reduce polyglutamine-induced toxicity in spinocerebellar ataxia type 3.

Ataxin-3, the disease protein in the neurodegenerative disorder Spinocerebellar Ataxia Type 3 or Machado Joseph disease, is a cysteine protease implicated in the ubiquitin proteasome pathway. It contains multiple ubiquitin binding sites through which it anchors polyubiquitin chains of different linkages that are then cleaved by the N-terminal catalytic (Josephin) domain. The properties of the ubiquitin interacting motifs (UIMs) in the C-terminus of ataxin-3 are well established. Very little is known, however, about how two recently identified ubiquitin-binding sites in the Josephin domain contribute to ubiquitin chain binding and cleavage. In the current study, we sought to define the specific contribution of the Josephin domain to the catalytic properties of ataxin-3 and assess how the topology and affinity of these binding sites modulate ataxin-3 activity. Using NMR we modeled the structure of diUb/Josephin complexes and showed that linkage preferences are imposed by the topology of the two binding sites. Enzymatic studies further helped us to determine a precise hierarchy between the sites. We establish that the structure of Josephin dictates specificity for K48-linked chains. Site 1, which is close to the active site, is indispensable for cleavage. Our studies open the way to understand better the cellular function of ataxin-3 and its link to pathology.

Machado-Joseph disease (MJD), also called spinocerebellar ataxia type 3, is caused by mutant ataxin-3 with a polyglutamine expansion. Although there is no treatment available at present to cure or delay the onset of MJD, mouse models have been generated to facilitate the development of a therapy. In this review, the published reports on mouse models of MJD and other polyglutamine spinocerebellar ataxias are compared. Based on these studies, the following approaches will be discussed as candidate treatments for MJD: 1) interfering with the formation of the mutant ataxin-3 cleavage fragment and possibly aggregate or inclusions, 2) reducing the disease protein nuclear localization, and 3) decreasing mutant ataxin-3 expression in neurons.

Mutant ataxin-3 is aberrantly folded and proteolytically cleaved in spinocerebellar ataxia type 3. The C-terminal region of the protein includes a polyglutamine stretch that is expanded in spinocerebellar ataxia type 3. Here, we report on the analysis of an ataxin-3 mutant mouse that has been obtained by gene trap integration. The ataxin-3 fusion protein encompasses 259â€‰N-terminal amino acids including the Josephin domain and an ubiquitin-interacting motif but lacks the C-terminus with the polyglutamine stretch, the valosin-containing protein binding region and part of the ubiquitin-interacting motif 2. Homozygous ataxin-3 mutant mice were viable and showed no apparent anatomical defects at birth. However, at the age of 9 months, homozygous and heterozygous mutant mice revealed significantly altered behaviour and progressing deficits of motor coordination followed by premature death at âˆ¼12 months. At this time, prominent extranuclear protein aggregates and neuronal cell death was found in mutant mice. This was associated with disturbances of the endoplasmic reticulum-mediated unfolded protein response, consistent with the normal role of ataxin-3 in endoplasmic reticulum homeostasis. Thus, the ataxin-3 gene trap model provides evidence for a contribution of the non-polyglutamine containing ataxin-3â€‰N-terminus, which mimics a calpain fragment that has been observed in spinocerebellar ataxia type 3. Consistent with the disease in humans, gene trap mice develop cytoplasmic inclusion bodies and implicate impaired unfolded protein response in the pathogenesis of spinocerebellar ataxia type 3.

Spinocerebellar ataxia type 3 (SCA3) is an inherited spinocerebellar ataxia caused by the expansion of trinucleotide CAG repeats in the gene encoding ataxin-3. The clinical manifestations of SCA3 include peripheral neuropathy, which is an important cause of disability in a subset of patients. Although the loss of neurones in the dorsal root ganglion (DRG) has been postulated to be the cause of this neuropathy, the precise mechanism remains to be elucidated. To clarify the clinicopathological characteristics of SCA3-associated peripheral neuropathy, we performed nerve conduction studies and histopathological analyses. Nerve conduction studies were carried out in 18 SCA3 patients. Immunohistochemical analyses of the anterior and posterior roots of the spinal cord and peripheral nerves were performed in five SCA3 patients. We also employed immunohistochemistry and immunoelectron microscopy analyses with an anti-polyglutamine antibody. The mean sensory nerve action potentials of the SCA3 patients were half of the normal values. The motor conduction velocities were decreased, and the distal latencies were also significantly prolonged in the nerves studied relative to the those in normal controls. Histopathological analyses detected axonal sprouting and myelin thinning in all cases. Ataxin-3 aggregates were found in the cytoplasm of Schwann cells in all of the SCA3 patients examined but not in control subjects. In addition to the previously reported neuronopathy, the results of the present study indicate that Schwann cells are involved in the formation of the pathogenic intracytoplasmic ataxin-3 protein aggregates in patients with SCA3-associated neuropathy.

Spinocerebellar ataxia type 3 is a neurodegenerative disorder caused by the expansion of the polyglutamine repeat region within the ataxin-3 protein. The mutant protein forms intracellular aggregates in the brain. However, the cellular mechanisms causing toxicity are still poorly understood and there are currently no effective treatments. In this study we show that administration of a rapamycin ester (cell cycle inhibitor-779, temsirolimus) improves motor performance in a transgenic mouse model of spinocerebellar ataxia type 3. Temsirolimus inhibits mammalian target of rapamycin and hence upregulates protein degradation by autophagy. Temsirolimus reduces the number of aggregates seen in the brains of transgenic mice and decreases levels of cytosolic soluble mutant ataxin-3, while endogenous wild-type protein levels remain unaffected. Temsirolimus is designed for long-term use in patients and therefore represents a possible therapeutic strategy for the treatment of spinocerebellar ataxia type 3. Using this disease model and treatment paradigm, we employed a microarray approach to investigate transcriptional changes that might be important in the pathogenesis of spinocerebellar ataxia type 3. This identified ubiquitin specific peptidase-15, which showed expression changes at both the messenger ribonucleic acid and protein level. Ubiquitin specific peptidase-15 levels were also changed in mice expressing another mutant polyglutamine protein, huntingtin. In total we identified 16 transcripts that were decreased in transgenic ataxin-3 mice that were normalized following temsirolimus treatment. In this mouse model with relatively mild disease progression, the number of transcripts changed was low and the magnitude of these changes was small. However, the importance of these transcriptional alterations in the pathogenesis of spinocerebellar ataxia type 3 remains unclear.

Ataxin-3 (AT3) is the protein that triggers the inherited neurodegenerative disorder spinocerebellar ataxia type 3 when its polyglutamine (polyQ) stretch close to the C-terminus exceeds a critical length. AT3 consists of the N-terminal globular Josephin domain (JD) and the C-terminal disordered one. It cleaves isopeptide bonds between ubiquitin monomers, an event involved in protein quality control mechanisms. AT3 has been implicated in the pathway that sorts aggregated protein to aggresomes via microtubules, in which dynein and histone deacetylase 6 (HDAC6) also seem to be involved. By taking advantage of small angle X-ray scattering (SAXS) and surface plasmon resonance (SPR), we have investigated the interaction of AT3 with tubulin and HDAC6. Based on SAXS results, the AT3 oligomer, consisting of 6-7 subunits, tightly binds to the tubulin hexameric oligomer in a "parallel" fashion. By SPR analysis we have demonstrated that AT3 binds to tubulin dimer with a 50nM affinity. Binding fits with a Langmuir 1:1 model and involves a single binding interface. Nevertheless, the interaction surface consists of three distinct, discontinuous tubulin-binding regions (TBR), one located in the JD, and the two others in the disordered domain, upstream and downstream of the polyQ stretch. In the absence of any of the three TBRs, the affinity is drastically reduced. By SPR we have also provided the first evidence of direct binding of AT3 to HDAC6, with affinity in the range 0.1-1Î¼M. These results shed light on the interactions among the components of the transport machinery that sorts aggregate protein to the aggresome, and pave the way to in vivo studies aimed at further clarifying their roles.
