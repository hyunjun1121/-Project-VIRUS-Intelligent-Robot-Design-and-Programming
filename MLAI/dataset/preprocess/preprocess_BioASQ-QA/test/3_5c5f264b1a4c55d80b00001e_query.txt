What is the function of Plasminogen activator inhibitor 1?

[PMID: 29454747]
Acetaminophen (APAP)-induced liver injury in mice is associated with activation of the coagulation cascade and deposition of fibrin in liver. Plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 (PAI-1) is an important physiological inhibitor of tissue-type plasminogen activator (tPA) and plays a critical role in fibrinolysis. PAI-1 expression is increased in both experimental APAP-induced liver injury and patients with acute liver failure. Prior studies have shown that PAI-1 prevents intrahepatic hemorrhage and mortality after APAP challenge, but the downstream mechanisms are not clear. We tested the hypothesis that PAI-1 limits liver-related morbidity after APAP challenge by reducing tPA-dependent fibrinolysis. Compared with APAP-challenged (300 mg/kg) wild-type mice, hepatic deposition of cross-linked fibrin was reduced, with intrahepatic congestion and hemorrhage increased in PAI-1-deficient mice 24 hours after APAP overdose. Administration of recombinant wild-type human PAI-1 reduced intrahepatic hemorrhage 24 hours after APAP challenge in PAI-1<sup>-/-</sup> mice, whereas a mutant PAI-1 lacking antiprotease function had no effect. Of interest, tPA deficiency alone did not affect APAP-induced liver damage. In contrast, fibrinolysis, intrahepatic congestion and hemorrhage, and mortality driven by PAI-1 deficiency were reduced in APAP-treated tPA<sup>-/-</sup>/PAI-1<sup>-/-</sup> double-knockout mice. The results identify PAI-1 as a critical regulator of intrahepatic fibrinolysis in experimental liver injury. Moreover, the results suggest that the balance between PAI-1 and tPA activity is an important determinant of liver pathology after APAP overdose.

Plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 (PAI-1), a crucial regulator of fibrinolysis, is increased in sepsis, but its values in predicting disease severity or mortality outcomes have been controversial. Therefore, we conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis of its predictive values in sepsis. PubMed and Embase were searched until August 18, 2017 for studies that evaluated the relationships between PAI-1 levels and disease severity or mortality in sepsis. A total of 112 and 251 entries were retrieved from the databases, of which 18 studies were included in the final meta-analysis. A total of 4,467 patients (36% male, mean age: 62 years, mean follow-up duration: 36 days) were analyzed. PAI-1 levels were significantly higher in non-survivors than survivors [odds ratios (OR): 3.93, 95% confidence interval (CI): 2.31-6.67, <i>P</i> < 0.0001] and in patients with severe sepsis than in those less severe sepsis (OR: 3.26, 95% CI: 1.37-7.75, <i>P</i> = 0.008). PAI-1 is a significant predictor of disease severity and all-cause mortality in sepsis. Although the predictive values of PAI-1 reached statistical significance, the clinical utility of PAI-1 in predicting outcomes will require carefully designed prospective trials.

Thrombospondin-1 (THBS1) affects corpus luteum (CL) regression. Highly induced during luteolysis, it acts as a natural anti-angiogenic, proapoptotic compound. THBS1 expression is regulated in bovine luteal endothelial cells (LECs) by fibroblast growth factor-2 (FGF2) and transforming growth factor-beta1 (TGFB1) acting in an opposite manner. Here we sought to identify specific microRNAs (miRNAs) targeting THBS1 and investigate their possible involvement in FGF2 and TGFB1-mediated THBS1 expression. Several miRNAs predicted to target THBS1 mRNA (miR-1, miR-18a, miR-144, miR-194, and miR-221) were experimentally tested. Of these, miR-221 was shown to efficiently target THBS1 expression and function in LECs. We found that this miRNA is highly expressed in luteal cells and in mid-cycle CL. Consistent with the inhibition of THBS1 function, miR-221 also reduced Serpin Family E Member 1 [SERPINE1] in LECs and promoted angiogenic characteristics of LECs. Plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 (PAI-1), the gene product of SERPINE1, inhibited cell adhesion, suggesting that PAI-1, like THBS1, has anti-angiogenic properties. Importantly, FGF2, which negatively regulates THBS1, elevates miR-221. Conversely, TGFB1 that stimulates THBS1, significantly reduces miR-221. Furthermore, FGF2 enhances the suppression of THBS1 caused by miR-221 mimic, and prevents the increase in THBS1 induced by miR-221 inhibitor. In contrast, TGFB1 reverses the inhibitory effect of miR-221 mimic on THBS1, and enhances the upregulation of THBS1 induced by miR-221 inhibitor. These data support the contention that FGF2 and TGFB1 modulate THBS1 via miR-221. These in vitro data propose that dynamic regulation of miR-221 throughout the cycle, affecting THBS1 and SERPINE1, can modulate vascular function in the CL.
