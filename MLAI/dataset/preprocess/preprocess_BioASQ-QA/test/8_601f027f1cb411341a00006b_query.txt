What is  Exencephaly?

[PMID: 18078364]
Exencephaly/anencephaly is a rare neural tube defect occurring early in embryogenesis. We report a 14-week-old fetus with exencephaly in whom central nervous system tissue was developed and preserved. There were 2 symmetrical structures grossly resembling cerebral hemispheres, which on histologic and ultrastructural study, consisted of a combination of ependymoblastomatous rosettes and canals and primitive neural tissue. The brainstem and spinal cord were partially normally formed, although descending tracts were not apparent. No cerebellar tissue was found. The eyes were formed. This appears to represent a rare example of exencephaly not covered by skin, which did not undergo necrosis and early transformation into a residual area cerebrovasculosa, characteristic of anencephaly. It may be appropriate to regard this as a unique neural tube closure defect that might be termed "ependymoblastomatous exencephaly."

The authors report a case of acrania diagnosed on antenatal period in a routine morphologic ultrasonography at 19 weeks of intra uterine gestation on a 20-year-old patient, gravida 1, para 0. Acrania associated with exencephaly is a rare and lethal malformation characterized by a defect of development of the flat bones of the scalp whereas cerebral tissue is present often abnormal. Ultrasonography had allowed to find besides the cerebral malformation, spinal and visceral fetal malformations as well as cord abnormality that included only two vessels.

The paper deals with first trimester diagnosis of exencephaly. In association with first trimester sonographic and cytogenetic screening of chromosomal anomalies in 1145 examined pregnancies 2 exencephalic fetuses with normal karyotype were diagnosed. Exencephaly was characterized with the absence of normal echoes of the exocranium, the lateral ventricles, the chorioid plexus, the cerebral falx, and with the presence of deformed shape of the head and irregular, lobulated cerebral material with increasing volume at follow-up examination. Anencephalic fetuses were diagnosed subsequent to therapeutic abortion, since the uterine and cervical wall contractions eroded the fragile brain tissue during fetal expulsion. However, fetal brain was identified in abortion material in both cases providing evidence that exencephaly is an embryologic precursor of anencephaly.

Extensive histological and immunohistochemical studies were performed to elucidate the histopathogenesis of exencephaly induced in chick embryo as an experimental model. The findings were compared with those identified in a chick myeloschisis experimental model and in human autopsy cases. The experimental model of exencephaly in chick embryos was developed by induction with various teratogens including ethylnitrosourea, salicylate, and phenytoin. None of the cases of exencephaly was exposed to a teratogen prior to or within Hamburger and Hamilton stage 12 (45 to 49 hours postincubation), when the anterior neuropore closes. The process of overgrowth in development of exencephaly was identical to that of myeloschisis, and the results suggested neuronal overmaturation in the histological and immunohistochemical studies. Although the late-stage degenerative change with neovascularization over the exposed neural tissue (placode) was more severe in human exencephaly, the present experimental study may suggest a possible common embryopathogenesis of dysraphism. Exencephaly should be regarded as the most severe form of cranium bifidum, as myeloschisis is in spina bifida.

Exencephaly is said to precede anencephaly resulting from failure of the rostral neuropore closure. In order to verify if the exencephaly induced after neural tube closure would also lead to anencephaly, exencephaly was induced in rat fetuses by maternal administration of a single dose (15 mg/kg) of cyclophosphamide on day 12 of gestation and pregnancy was prolonged by uterine ligation until postconception (PC) day 24. Fetal death was found to increase with prolongation of gestation and no sign of recovery from growth retardation was observed. Alizarin red-S-stained skeletal preparations substantiated the persistence of skull malformations in the exencephalic fetuses. Histological observations of the mesenchyme and the brain indicated degenerative changes that were intensifying with time. The ventricular system expanded progressively; the ependyma was denuded and neural mass lay free in the ventricle. The choroid plexus appeared to be elaborate and extensive. The haemorrhagic capillary network around the brain tissue was highly proliferative and appeared to penetrate the former from the exterior. Tissue necrosis seemed to progress unabated. Cystic spaces appeared beneath the base of the brain and became progressively large and it appeared as if the brain was being pushed out of the shallow cranial fossae. By PC day 24, most of the brain tissue had degenerated, thus giving clearly the appearance of the anencephalic condition.

The antenatal sonographic diagnosis of exencephaly in four gestations is reported. Exencephaly is an uncommon malformation of the cranium that characteristically involves a large, disorganized mass of cerebral tissue. The flat bones of the calvaria are absent, leaving the brain mass uncovered. Secondarily, anencephaly may develop as a result of prolonged exposure of the developing encephalon to amniotic fluid and trauma in utero. As in anencephaly, facial structures and the bony base of the calvarium are often preserved in exencephaly. Sonographically, the outstanding feature of exencephaly is the cerebral mass, with convolutions or "pseudo" sulcal patterns present. These findings correlate well with the pathologic examination and define a clinical entity that is incompatible with human life.

Exencephaly is a rare precursor of anencephaly in which a large amount of brain tissue is present despite the absence of the calvaria. It was discovered together with hydramnios in a near-term fetus. Sonographic, angiographic, and pathologic findings are discussed.

The neural tube (NT), the embryonic precursor of the vertebrate brain and spinal cord, is generated by a complex and highly dynamic morphological process. In mammals, the initially flat neural plate bends and lifts bilaterally to generate the neural folds followed by fusion of the folds at the midline during the process of neural tube closure (NTC). Failures in any step of this process can lead to neural tube defects (NTDs), a common class of birth defects that occur in approximately 1 in 1000 live births. These severe birth abnormalities include spina bifida, a failure of closure at the spinal level; craniorachischisis, a failure of NTC along the entire body axis; and exencephaly, a failure of the cranial neural folds to close which leads to degeneration of the exposed brain tissue termed anencephaly. The mouse embryo presents excellent opportunities to explore the genetic basis of NTC in mammals; however, its in utero development has also presented great challenges in generating a deeper understanding of how gene function regulates the cell and tissue behaviors that drive this highly dynamic process. Recent technological advances are now allowing researchers to address these questions through visualization of NTC dynamics in the mouse embryo in real time, thus offering new insights into the morphogenesis of mammalian NTC.
