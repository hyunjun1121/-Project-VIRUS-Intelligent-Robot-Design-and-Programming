What is the characteristic feature of the Dyke-Davidoff-Masson syndrome.

[PMID: 25207154]
Dyke-Davidoff-Masson Syndrome (DDMS) is a rarely seen clinical entity which is characterised by cerebral hemiatrophy, contralateral hemiparesis and epilepsy. Radiological features are typical, such as unilateral atrophy of the cerebral hemisphere and associated compensatory bone changes in the skull, like thickening, enlargement of the paranasal sinuses and mastoid air cells. In this article, we report the first case of DDMS associated with epidermoid tumour and arachnoid cyst, who underwent operation for an epidermoid tumour in the inter-hemispheric region. To our knowledge, this is the first report of DDMS associated with multiple intracranial pathologies and this association has not been previously described in the literature. Any patient who receives DDMS in the light of clinical and radiological findings should be investigated for concomitant pathologies. Different sequences of MRI may be useful in the diagnosis of other intracranial lesions.

Prenatal ultrasonographic detection of unilateral cerebral ventriculomegaly arises suspicion of pathological condition related to cerebrospinal fluid flow obstruction or cerebral parenchimal pathology. Dyke-Davidoff-Masson syndrome is a rare condition characterized by cerebral hemiatrophy, calvarial thickening, skull and facial asymmetry, contralateral hemiparesis, cognitive impairment and seizures. Congenital and acquired types are recognized and have been described, mainly in late childhood, adolescence and adult ages. We describe a female infant with prenatal diagnosis of unilateral left ventriculomegaly in which early brain MRI and contrast enhanced-MRI angiography, showed cerebral left hemiatrophy associated with reduced caliber of the left middle cerebral artery revealing the characteristic findings of the Dyke-Davidoff-Masson syndrome. Prenatal imaging, cerebral vascular anomaly responsible for the cerebral hemiatrophy and the early clinical evolution have never been described before in such a young child and complete the acquired clinical descriptions in older children. Differential diagnosis, genetic investigations, neurophysiologic assessments, short term clinical and developmental follow up are described. Dyke-Davidoff-Masson syndrome must be ruled out in differential diagnosis of fetal unilateral ventriculomegaly. Early clinical assessment, differential diagnosis and cerebral imaging including cerebral MRI angiography allow the clinicians to diagnose also in early infancy this rare condition.

Described here is the case of a girl with a reticulated capillary malformation on the right side of her face, along with Dyke-Davidoff-Masson syndrome, as evidenced by microphthalmia and severe associated anomalies in the right eye, and right cerebral hemispheric atrophy and cerebral arteries malformations. Capillary malformations are a novel finding for children with Dyke-Davidoff-Masson syndrome.

Dyke-Davidoff-Masson syndrome (DDMS) is a rare epilepsy syndrome that is characterized by cerebral hemiatrophy, homolateral skull hyperplasia, hyperpneumatization of the paranasal sinuses, seizures with or without mental retardation, and contralateral hemiparesis. We describe a case of DDMS in a 40-year-old female who had complex partial seizures with occasional secondary generalization since the age of 4 years. Her seizure frequency was 10-20 seizures/month even though she took four antiepileptic drugs. We applied magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), positron emission tomography (PET), functional MRI, and invasive electroencephalography (EEG) to define her epileptogenic and functional zones. Brain MRI showed prominent atrophy in the left frontal dorsal and lateral regions and mild atrophy of the left superior temporal gyrus and left parietal gyri. Interictal PET revealed decreased glucose metabolism in the atrophic regions. Functional MRI demonstrated that the inferior frontal and inferior parieto-occipital regions of the right hemisphere were activated by language testing. Invasive EEG revealed that the left lateral temporal lobe was the sole source of her seizures. Our results imply that the "metabolic border zone" rather than the atrophic region plays an important role in seizure activity, and that reorganization of functional zones occur after cerebral damage early in life.

The so-called Dyke-Davidoff-Masson syndrome (DDMS) is a rare disorder of cerebral hemiatrophy. The clinical presentation may consist of facial asymmetry, contralateral atrophy (including the trunk, and the extremities) and hemiparesis, speech difficulties, mental retardation, and epilepsy. Because it involves multiple systems, especially problem of the airway, occult myopathy, and seizure disorder, anesthesia for such a patient is a challenge to any anesthesiologist. However, there are no clinical reports which concern the anesthetic management of such patients in the literature. We herein report a 5-year-old girl, a sufferer of DDMS, scheduled for burr trephination. The successful anesthetic management is brought forward with highlights of inference from the experience.

A growing skull fracture or leptomeningeal cyst most commonly occurs in children under the age of 3 years, and is extremely rare in adults. The reason for a growing skull fracture is usually a dural tear in association with the fracture. This paper presents an 18-year-old mentally retarded patient with cerebral hemiatrophy (Dyke-Davidoff-Masson syndrome) associated with a growing skull fracture in the ipsilateral hemicranium, in whom not only a dural tear but also the ipsilaterally displaced and dilated lateral ventricle due to the original disease apparently contributed to the development of growing skull fracture.

A patient with Dyke-Davidoff-Masson Syndrome had a lifelong history of spatial disorientation and visual-spatial cognitive defects demonstrated by psychological tests. We suggest that the abnormalities of behavior and test performance may be related atrophic lesions demonstrated by pneumoencephalography and computerized axial tomography. We consider several explanations to account for the lack of compensation for these cognitive defects.

Although radiological findings of cerebral hemiatrophy (Dyke-Davidoff-Masson Syndrome) are well known, there is no systematic study about the gender and the affected side in this syndrome. Brain images in 26 patients (mean aged 11) with cerebral hemiatrophy were retrospectively reviewed. Nineteen patients (73.5%) were male and seven patients (26.5%) were female. Left hemisphere involvement was seen in 18 patients (69.2%) and right hemisphere involvement was seen in eight patients (30.8%). We conclude that male gender and left side involvement are frequent in cerebral hemiatrophy disease.

Dyke-Davidoff-Masson syndrome is a disorder involving hemiatrophy or hypoplasia of 1 cerebral hemisphere secondary to an insult in the developing brain. Often this will manifest with seizures, hemiparesis, mental retardation, and facial changes. Associated with this pathology are the radiologically evident changes, such as thickening of the calvarium, hyperpneumatization of the sinuses, and dilation of the ipsilateral lateral ventricle among others. The following is a case presentation of an 18-year-old female emigrating from Ghana who presented to the emergency department with complaints of seizures diagnosed as being caused by cerebral malaria at 13 years of age. We hypothesize that the cerebral malaria and related vascular occlusion are the causes of her acquired cerebral changes. Included are computed tomography images.

Dyke-Davidoff-Masson syndrome refers to atrophy of one cerebral hemisphere (hemiatrophy) due to an insult to the brain in fetal or early childhood period. This is an uncommon condition. We present a case of a nine month- old female presented with seizure and weakness of the right upper and lower extremities and subsequently computed tomography was performed and showed hemiatrophy of the left fronto-parietal lobe with degenerative changes in the left cerebral peduncle.

Cerebral hemiatrophy or Dyke-Davidoff-Masson syndrome is a condition characterized by seizures, facial asymmetry, contralateral hemiplegia or hemiparesis, and mental retardation. These findings are due to cerebral injury that may occur early in life or in utero. The radiological features are unilateral loss of cerebral volume and associated compensatory bone alterations in the calvarium, like thickening, hyperpneumatization of the paranasal sinuses and mastoid cells and elevation of the petrous ridge. The authors describe three cases. Classical findings of the syndrome are present in variable degrees according to the extent of the brain injury. Pathogenesis is commented.

Authors describe the case of a 16-year-old girl who presented with fever, tonic-clonic seizures, unequal arm blood pressures and pulselessness in the left upper limb. On examination, there was a systolic bruit over umbilical region, a pansystolic murmur of mitral regurgitation was found. Neurological examination was normal except for an asymmetry in brain hemicircumference one side compared with the other. She has borderline intelligence (IQ 70) according to Wechsler Adult Performance Intelligence Scale. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of brain revealed atrophic of left cerebral hemisphere with mildly ventricular dilatation, prominent paranasal and mastoid air cells, suggestive of Dyke-Davidoff-Masson syndrome (DDMS). Conventional angiography showed narrowed left internal carotid artery. There was also stenosed brachial artery, absent left renal artery with narrowed infrarenal abdominal aorta. The patient was put on antihypertensive drugs. We hypothesise that Takayasu arteritis and related vascular occlusion is the cause of her acquired cerebral changes.

The purpose of this study was to retrospectively evaluate the cognitive and electroclinical characteristics of right cerebral hemiatrophy (Dyke-Davidoff-Masson syndrome [DDMS]). Cognitive assessments with a particular emphasis on visuospatial functions, electroclinical features, and neuroimaging characteristics were analyzed for five patients with a clinically and neuroradiologically confirmed diagnosis of right-sided DDMS. Intelligence tests revealed mental retardation in all but one. Neuropsychological assessments demonstrated consistent impairments in tasks that have a spatial component (spatial processing and orientation discrimination), whereas attention, executive functions and verbal memory domains were variably impaired. Electroclinically, the main seizure types were simple partial motor, complex partial, and secondarily generalized seizures. Interictal EEG delineated lower amplitudes and slow background activity in the affected hemisphere. Overall, the cognitive performance of patients with DDMS encompasses a broad spectrum of impairments affecting multiple domains. Our findings support the concept that dorsal visual pathways responsible for spatial processing may be lateralized to the right hemisphere.

The purpose of this study was to emphasize the clinical and imaging findings of 19 child cases of cerebral hemiatrophy. A total of 11 male and eight female patients underwent assessment with computed tomography and magnetic resonance imaging. The patients ranged from 1 to 17 years in age. The evaluated parameters were: location of the lesions, midline structural shift effect, ipsilateral calvarial and parenchymal changes. Left cerebral hemiatrophy was seen in 14 of the cases while right cerebral hemiatrophy was observed in five cases. Unilateral calvarial thickening was seen in 11 cases, hyperpneumatization of paranasal sinuses in five, and hypoplasia of the middle frontal cranial fossa in three patients. Cerebral peduncle atrophy was noted in seven cases. In total, 11 patients had thalamic atrophy and lentiform nucleus hypoplasia. In one case, cerebral hemiatrophy was associated with ipsilateral large schizencephalic cleft and absence of the septum pellucidum, whereas in another case, there was diffuse cerebellar atrophy associated with cerebral hemiatrophy. Computed tomography and, in particular, magnetic resonance imaging are the procedures of choice with respect to assessment of the etiology and extent of cerebral parenchymal involvement in cerebral hemiatrophy.

Dyke Davidoff Masson syndrome (DDMS) refers to atrophy or hypoplasia of one cerebral hemisphere following a prior fetal or childhood insult. It has characteristics of clinical and radiological changes. These changes include hemiparesis, seizures, facial-asymmetry, and mental retardation. We present a 25-year-old man with crossed cerebrocerebellar atrophy and DDMS. His seizures were well controlled using a combination of antiepileptic drugs.

The patient was a 19-year-old woman who presented with hemiatrophy and diminished superficial sensation on the left side of her body including her face. She had a past history of tonic-clonic seizures accompanied by left hemiparesis in late childhood. Brain CT demonstrated dilatation of the frontal sinus, calvarial thickening, cerebral hemiatrophy and dilatation of the lateral ventricle on the right side. Brain MRI showed atrophy of the right cerebrum and midbrain and dilatation of the lateral ventricle on T1-weighted images, as well as a high signal intensity area from the parietal to the occipital lobe on T2-weighted images. These findings are suggestive of an episode that may have caused a transient ischemia through the right cerebral hemisphere after the intrauterine period.

Dyke-Davidoff-Masson syndrome is a condition characterized by seizures, facial asymmetry, contralateral hemiplegia or hemiparesis and mental retardation. We report the clinical and imaging features in two patients with epilepsy revealing a Dyke-Davidoff-Masson syndrome. Brain MRI showed unilateral loss of cerebral volume with hypertrophy and hyperpneumatization of the paranasal sinuses and mastoid cells. Ipsilateral fronto-parietal polymicrogyria was present in one patient.

We reported five cases of Dyke-Davidoff-Masson syndrome (DDMS) with different clinical and radiological findings. The evaluated parameters were the location of the lesions, midline structural shift effect, pathological and morphological changes on the ipsilateral calvarium, paranasal sinuses and mesencephalon, presence of compensatory contralateral hypertrophy. With the help of both magnetic resonance (MR) and computerized tomography (CT) images, changing degrees of all the evaluated parameters were observed in all five of our patients. In conclusion, no relationship was found between parenchymal and calvarial changes and between the time after onset of the disease and amount of the morphologic and pathological changes.

Dyke-Davidoff-Masson syndrome is a relatively rare syndrome with its typical clinical and radiological features including facial asymmetry, hemiplegia, cerebral hemiatrophy, mental retardation with calvarial thickening, hypertrophy of sinuses and elevated petrous ridge on imaging. We present here a case of congenital type Dyke-Davidoff-Masson syndrome with some additional features in the form of microcephaly, hypospadias and pachygyria.

The magnetic resonance (MR) findings of three patients with cerebral hemiatrophy, the so-called Dyke-Davidoff-Masson syndrome, which is characterized by variable degrees of unilateral loss of cerebral volume and compensatory changes of the calvarium are presented. The condition was due to middle cerebral artery stroke in all patients. The pathologic alterations of cerebral tissue and the brainstem were reflected in detail on the MR studies. MR findings in addition to the primary vascular insult included prominence of the cortical sulci and perimesencephalic cistern in one subject with acquired infarction, but an absence of such generalized sulcal prominence in two cases of congenital infantile paralysis. Otherwise the secondary ipsilateral pathologic observations were quite similar in the patients with congenital and acquired ischemic disease and encompassed a unilaterally small cerebral hemisphere together with ipsilateral diploic calvarial expansion, elevation of the petrous bone and orbital roof, and hypoplasia/atrophy of the cerebral peduncle. Although computed tomography (CT) and MR are complimentary, it is felt that MR represents the imaging procedure of choice with respect to the assessment of the etiology and extent of cerebral parenchymal involvement in patients presenting with a clinical combination of congenital or early onset of seizures, hemiparesis/plegia, and/or craniofacial asymmetry.

Dyke-Davidoff-Masson syndrome is clinically characterized by hemiparesis, hemiplegia, seizures, mental retardation, and facial asymmetry secondary to congenital or early childhood vascular insult. A 21-year-old man with Dyke-Davidoff-Masson syndrome presented with uncontrolled seizures. The authors present the magnetic resonance (MR) and positron emission tomography (PET) findings of this syndrome.

cerebral hemiatrophy (CHA) can present in childhood or adulthood, if it presents before or after two years of age. This two entities differ in etiology, clinical presentation and imaging characteristics. The CHA of childhood or Dyke-Davidoff-Masson syndrome, is originated by intrauterine or perinatal insults that affect the perfusion of a single cerebral hemisphere, manifesting clinically by variable mental retardation, refractory epilepsy, facial asymmetry, hemiplegia/hemiparesis or abnormal movements of the contralateral extremities and by imaging studies, loss of volume in one cerebral hemisphere and ipsilateral compensatory cranial changes such as skull vault thickening, elevation of the orbital roof and petreous ridge, also hyperpneumatization of the frontal sinus and mastoid cells. Instead, the CHA of the adult is multifactorial and by imaging it only manifests as loss of volume in one cerebral hemisphere, without compensatory changes in the skull. we present a classic clinical case of CHA secondary to perinatal insult and another case of CHA of adulthood secondary to multiple embolic strokes in a patient with inactive rheumatic heart disease, commenting the imaging differences of these rare clinical entities.

We reported a 39-year-old man with Dyke-Davidoff-Masson syndrome presenting with total hemiatrophy. The patient had a muscle defect in the left occipital lesion at birth and left hemiatrophy including the face in his infancy. The present illness consists of atrophy of the left face, trunk and extremities, a muscle defect accompanied with scleroderma of the left dorsal cervical lesion, bilateral pes cavus, cleft palate, left hemiparesis, including facial palsy and diminished superficial sensation of the left side of the body. Decrease in right cranial volume and slight elevation of the right temporal pyramid and the superior border of the orbit were seen on the X-ray study of the head. Atrophy of the right cerebrum and cerebral peduncle was seen on magnetic resonance imaging. These findings suggest that hemiatrophy of the brain was responsible for total hemiatrophy of the body in this patient. The etiology of cerebral hemiatrophy is not known. There is only a report of Dyke-Davidoff-Masson syndrome accompanied with total hemiatrophy.

A rare syndrome, Dyke-Davidoff-Masson Syndrome (DDMS), with a diagnostic conundrum, and the way it was solved is presented. A 13-year-old boy presented with recurrent seizures for the past 10 years. He had been treated with anticonvulsant medication which was satisfactory at first but later the seizures recurred. Recently, the frequency of the seizures increased with preictal dizziness and postictal drowsiness. Physical examination revealed mild left hemiparesis and left deviated gait irregularity. He was mentally alert but had not achieved all the developmental milestones as compared to normal child of his age. CT and MRI scan of the head showed hemiatrophic cerebral parenchyma with prominent sulci and encephalomalacia. 24-hour intensive video EEG monitoring revealed suppression of alpha rhythm and local slow wave activity on the side of the atrophic hemisphere. PET-CT showed highly functional left cerebral hemisphere and less functional right cerebral hemisphere. The patient underwent functional hemispherectomy under neurophysiological monitoring and the nonfunctional brain tissues were resected while selectively preserving the functional areas detected by fMRI and PET-CT scan. During follow up, the patient was seizure free as well as without difficulties in performing his daily activities and communications. Functional hemispherectomy for DDMS patient has a good prognosis.

Dyke Davidoff Masson syndrome (DDMS) is characterized by seizures, facial asymmetry, contralateral hemiplegia and mental retardation. The characteristic radiologic features are cerebral hemiatrophy with homolateral hypertrophy of the skull and sinuses. We report a case of DDMS in an 18-month-old girl who presented with right sided focal seizures, hemiparesis of the same side, and delayed milestones.

Dyke-Davidoff-Masson syndrome, or cerebral hemiatrophy, is a pre- or perinatally acquired entity characterized by predominantly neurologic symptoms, such as seizures, facial asymmetry, contralateral hemiplegia, and mental retardation. Psychiatric symptoms are rarely reported. We report the first case of left cerebral hemiatrophy and a late onset of treatment-resistant schizoaffective disorder after a stressful life event. The patient finally responded well to clozapine. The clinical history and results from structural neuroimaging are highlighted to discuss the possible developmental bias for psychotic disorders.

We describe a case of hemitrophy in a 12-year-old child presenting with seizures, hemiplegia and mental retardation. Hemiatrophy of one cerebral hemisphere is not frequently encountered in clinical practice. When this develops early in life (during the first two years), certain cranial changes like ipsilateral hypertrophy of the skull and sinuses occur. Asymmetry of cerebral hemispheric growth with atrophy on one side, ipsilateral osseous hypertrophy and hyper-pneumatization of sinuses with contralateral paresis are features of Dyke Davidoff Masson Syndrome (DDMS). Probably vascular occlusion was most important cause of hemiatrophy in our case.

Invasive craniocerebral aspergillosis, often encountered in an immunocompromised setting, is almost uniformly fatal despite radical surgical and medical management, and is frequently a necropsy finding. The authors report a unique, self-resolving clinical course of this aggressive infection in a 10-month-old infant. The infant was brought to the emergency services in altered sensorium with a 1-week history of left-sided hemiparesis, excessive irritability, and vomiting. An MRI study of the brain revealed multiple, heterogeneously enhancing lesions in the right cerebral hemisphere with mass effect. The largest lesion in the frontotemporal cortical and subcortical regions was decompressed on an emergent basis. Histopathological findings were suggestive of invasive aspergillosis, although there was no evidence of the infection in the lungs or paranasal sinuses. Computed tomography-guided aspiration of the remaining lesions and follow-up antifungal therapy were recommended. The parents, however, requested discharge without further treatment. The child was seen at a follow-up visit 3 years later without having received any antifungal treatment. Imaging showed resolution of the infection and features of Dyke-Davidoff-Masson syndrome (cerebral hemiatrophy). This report of invasive cerebral aspergillosis resolving without medical therapy is the first of its kind. Its clinicoradiological aspects are discussed in light of previously reported cases.

The Dyke-Davidoff-Masson syndrome is characterized by various symptoms related to hemiatrophy of the cerebrum and hypertrophy of the ipsilateral calvarium and paranasal sinuses. Clinical findings include hemiparesis or hemiplegia, seizures and/or mental retardation. The present report discusses the very unusual case of a late-diagnosed Dyke-Davidoff-Masson syndrome in a 75-year-old body donor who had suffered a left-sided stroke associated with the internal carotid artery in the course of tonsillitis at the age of 5.

Dyke-Davidoff-Masson syndrome (DDMS) has cerebral hemiatrophy and compensatory ipsilateral skull thickening, and is manifested by recurrent seizures and hemiparesis. We present one case with typical DDMS, who had a brother suffering from epilepsy with mild imaging abnormality relevant to DDMS and similar seizure semiology. A 26-year-old man had a history of developmental delay, mental retardation, hemiparesis and recurrent seizures. His brother, 23-year-old man had also experienced recurrent seizures, but he had no neurological deficits. Older brother experienced focal motor seizures with/without secondary generalization. Sometimes, he noted an auditory aura. MRI demonstrated the hemispheric atrophy with the adjacent bony hypertrophy. The seizures of younger brother were mainly of the auditory type and the MRI showed mild hemispheric atrophy with hippocampal sclerosis without any bony change. Our sibling cases might have a familial predisposition and support the idea that clinical courses and radiological findings of DDMS are varied even within one family.
