What disease does BCG immunotherapy used to treat?

[PMID: 31755155]
Bacillus Calmette-Guérin (BCG) immunotherapy for bladder cancer has been used since 1976 when the first evidence of its ability to lower recurrence and progression rates was published. Today, BCG immunotherapy is the choice of care for high-grade non-muscle invasive bladder cancer (NMIBC) after transurethral resection. This article presents indications and procedure of BCG instillations, and outlines the effects on recurrence and progression of NMIBC. The BCG-induced immunity in NMIBC is not yet fully understood. Animal studies point towards BCG inducing specific tumour immunity. We describe the current knowledge of how this immunity is induced, from internalization of BCG bacilli in urothelial cells, to cytokine- and chemokine-mediated recruitment of neutrophils, monocytes, macrophages, T cells, B cells and natural killer cells. In addition, we describe the process of trained immunity, the non-specific protective effects of BCG. Recent studies also indicate that dysbiosis of the urinary microbiome may cause lower urinary tract dysfunction. Side effects of BCG bladder instillations range from common, mild and transient symptoms, such as dysuria and flu-like symptoms, to more severe and rarely occurring life-threatening complications. We review the literature and give an overview of reported incidences and management of BCG infections after intravesical instillation.

WHAT'S KNOWN ON THE SUBJECT? AND WHAT DOES THE STUDY ADD?: The administration of Bacillus Calmette-Guérin (BCG) immunotherapy has become the standard of care for high-grade non-muscle invasive bladder cancer (NMIBC) and carcinoma in-situ (CIS) in terms of prevention of recurrence and progression. While most agree on a 6 week induction cycle, various maintenance schedules (if any at all) have been implemented without a unifying consensus. This review assesses the historical emergence of BCG immunotherapy, beginning with its discovery as a vaccinatin for tuberculosis to its effect on the host immune system and potential therapeutic benefits for various oncologic conditions. The data establishing BCG immunotherapy as the standard of care for high-grade NMIBC and CIS over other bladder instillation modalities is presented in addition to the effect maintenance BCG therapy has on sustaining the immuno-protective effect. Bacillus Calmette-Guérin (BCG) immunotherapy is currently the most effective treatment of non-muscle invasive bladder cancer and one of the most successful applications of immunotherapy to the treatment of cancer. This review summarises the history and development of BCG as a modern cancer treatment, appraises current optimal application of BCG immunotherapy in bladder cancer, discusses promising new therapies closely related to BCG, and briefly explores the possibility that BCG or related treatments may have an application in other urological malignancies. BCG is a nonspecific stimulant to the reticuloendothelial system and induces a local inflammatory response with the infiltration of granulocytes followed by macrophages and lymphocytes, particularly helper T cells. The initial BCG controlled trial showed a statistically significant reduction in tumour recurrence and found the advantage increased with duration of follow-up. Similar results were reported in much higher risk patients in an independent concurrent study. Follow-up suggested that a single 6-week course of intravesical BCG provided long-term protection (up to 10 years) from tumour recurrence and even reduced disease progression. While induction BCG (six weekly instillations) reduced recurrence, progression and mortality at 10 years, this advantage was lost by 15 years, and patients remained at high risk for progression without the use of maintenance BCG. In a meta-analysis by the Cochrane group, induction BCG was found to be markedly superior to mitomycin C in high-risk patients but not in low-risk patients. Additionally, the National Comprehensive Cancer Network guidelines lists the use of intravesical BCG as preferred therapy, citing Category 1 data for high-grade Ta, all T1, and any Tis tumours. Maintenance BCG therapy may be the most important advance in BCG treatment of bladder cancer since the initial introduction. The risk of tumour recurrence and disease progression is life-long in most patients, but the immune stimulation induced by BCG wanes with time. Logarithmic dose reduction of BCG in patients with increasing side-effects will typically prevent escalation of toxicity. Simple dose reduction, appropriate antibiotics, and understanding treatment contraindications have greatly increased the safety of BCG. The 3-week maintenance schedule for 3 years has been evaluated in randomised clinical trials and appears to be the current optimal treatment. With the success achieved in bladder cancer and the relative safety and economy of BCG, consideration should be given to further research for its effectiveness in other genitourinary malignancies.

Intravesical immunotherapy, chemotherapy, and neoadjuvant systemic chemotherapy are among the most frequent therapeutic procedures to treat malignancies of the urinary bladder. These treatment modalities produce reactive morphologic changes in the urothelium that can mimic urothelial carcinoma in situ, urothelial dysplasia or true invasive urothelial neoplasia. Mitomycin C used after transurethral resection of bladder tumor to reduce recurrences, BCG intravesical immunotherapy to treat high risk non-muscle invasive bladder cancer and urothelial carcinoma in situ, and platinum-based systemic chemotherapy to improve post-cystectomy disease-specific survival some of the causes of therapy related atypia in urinary bladder. In addition, a number of systemic drugs in use to treat other systemic diseases, such as cyclophosphamide used to treat certain auto-immune disorders or hematologic malignancies, or the anesthetics ketamine increasingly used as illegal recreational drug, may produce similarly relevant atypical changes in the urothelium, and therefore, need to be differentiated from intraepithelial neoplasia. Immunohistochemical approach to reactive urothelium from CIS using CK20, p53, and CD44 may also be of utility in the pos-therapy scenario.

The primary role of immunotherapy for bladder cancer is to treat superficial transitional cell carcinomas (ie, carcinoma in situ, Ta, and T1). Immunotherapy in the form of bacille Calmette-Guérin (BCG), interferon, bropirimine, keyhole limpet hemocyanin, and gene therapy is intended to treat existing or residual tumor, to prevent recurrence of tumor, to prevent progression of disease, and to prolong survival of patients. Presently, BCG is commonly used and is the most effective immunotherapeutic agent against superficial transitional cell carcinoma. Data support that BCG has a positive impact on tumor recurrence, disease progression, and survival. Proper attention to maintenance schedules, route of administration, dosing, strains, and viability is essential to obtain the maximum benefits of BCG immunotherapy. This review highlights and summarizes the recent advances concerning immunotherapy, with special emphasis on BCG therapy for transitional cell carcinoma.

Side-effects are commonly manifested during intravesical Bacillus Calmette-Guérin (BCG) immunotherapy of superficial bladder cancer. This often causes delays or interruptions of the instillations and consequently reduces the efficacy of treatment. Treatment strategies aimed at reducing the side-effects of BCG immunotherapy while maintaining efficacy are currently being considered in the search for an optimal treatment regimen. The following two approaches to BCG immunotherapy were investigated at the Department of Urology of Padova University by specific Phase II and III trials designed to evaluate the possibility of reducing BCG-related side-effects without compromising therapeutic efficacy: (1) by reducing the dose of BCG per instillation 'low-dose' regimen, (2) by delaying the interval of the instillations 'slow-rate' regimen.

Bladder cancer is a common malignant disease, with non-muscle-invasive bladder cancer (NMIBC) representing the majority of tumors. This cancer subtype is typically treated by transurethral resection. In spite of treatment, up to 70% of patients show local recurrences. Intravesical BCG (Bacillus Calmette-Guerin) immunotherapy has been widely used to treat NMIBC, but it fails to suppress recurrence of bladder tumors in up to 40% of patients. Therefore, the development of prognostic markers is needed to predict the progression of bladder cancer and the efficacy of intravesical BCG treatment. This study demonstrates the effectiveness of an E2F4 signature for prognostic prediction of bladder cancer. E2F4 scores for each sample in a bladder cancer expression dataset were calculated by summarizing the relative expression levels of E2F4 target genes identified by ChIP-seq, and then the scores were used to stratify patients into good- and poor-outcome groups. The molecular signature was investigated in a single bladder cancer dataset and then its effectiveness was confirmed in two meta-bladder datasets consisting of specimens from multiple independent studies. These results were consistent in different datasets and demonstrate that the E2F4 score is predictive of clinical outcomes in bladder cancer, with patients whose tumors exhibit an E2F4 score >0 having significantly shorter survival times than those with an E2F4 score <0, in both non-muscle-invasive, and muscle-invasive bladder cancer. Furthermore, although intravesical BCG immunotherapy can significantly improve the clinical outcome of NMIBC patients with positive E2F4 scores (E2F4>0 group), it does not show significant treatment effect for those with negative scores (E2F4<0 group). The E2F4 signature can be applied to predict the progression/recurrence and the responsiveness of patients to intravesical BCG immunotherapy in bladder cancer.

Although intravesical instillation of Bacille-Calmette-Guerin (BCG) immunotherapy was approved many decades ago as a first line therapy for intermediate to high-risk non-muscle invasive bladder cancer, its long-term efficacy is still arguable as a proportion of up to 30-40% of patients will develop recurrence or progression of their disease. Based on currently available data on the clinical application of checkpoint inhibitors in solid tumors, the mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue seems to be a main target for anti-CTLA-4 antibodies. In this manuscript we hypothesize that the combination of anti-CTLA-4 therapy with BCG might enhance the immune activity in the bladder submucosal tissue, and subsequently, improve oncological outcomes of NMIBC.

Bladder cancer arises from the epithelial lining of the urinary bladder, and it is known as transitional cell carcinoma (TCC). Tobacco smoking is the main known contributor to urinary bladder cancer. However thirty percent of bladder tumors probably result from occupational exposure in the workplace to carcinogens. Immunotherapy by intravesicular delivery of Bacillus Calmette–Guérin (BCG) is used to treat and prevent the recurrence of superficial bladder cancer. Successful BCG immunotherapy for bladder cancer is associated with proper induction of T helper (Th)1 immunity. In bladder cancer patients after intravesicular BCG, urine was found to contain high levels of IP-10, and Interferon (IFN)-γ. TCC and endothelial cell lines were able to secrete IP-10 in response to BCG or IFN stimulation in vitro. Furthermore intravesicular BCG induces a cytokine-rich urinary microenvironment that is inhibitory to human endothelial cells and it is anti-angiogenetic by the induction of Th1 chemokines. Other studies suggest that therapeutic strategies involving Th1 induction and Th2 dampening may improve responses to immunotherapy. Further studies are needed to evaluate the IP-10 in circulation, and urine, as prognostic marker of bladder cancer patients, also in relation to BCG immunotherapy

It is nearly 40 years since Bacillus Calmette-Guérin (BCG) was first used as an immunotherapy to treat superficial bladder cancer. Despite its limitations, to date it has not been surpassed by any other treatment. As a better understanding of its mechanism of action and the clinical response to it have evolved, some of the questions around optimal dosing and treatment protocols have been answered. However, its potential for toxicity and failure to produce the desired clinical effect in a significant cohort of patients presents an ongoing challenge to clinicians and researchers alike. This review summarizes the evidence behind the established mechanism of action of BCG in bladder cancer, highlighting the extensive array of immune molecules that have been implicated in its action. The clinical aspects of BCG are discussed, including its role in reducing recurrence and progression, the optimal treatment regime, toxicity and, in light of new evidence, whether or not there is a superior BCG strain. The problems of toxicity and non-responders to BCG have led to development of new techniques aimed at addressing these pitfalls. The progress made in the laboratory has led to the identification of novel targets for the development of new immunotherapies. This includes the potential augmentation of BCG with various immune factors through to techniques avoiding the use of BCG altogether; for example, using interferon-activated mononuclear cells, BCG cell wall, or BCG cell wall skeleton. The potential role of gene, virus, or photodynamic therapy as an alternative to BCG is also reviewed. Recent interest in the immune check point system has led to the development of monoclonal antibodies against proteins involved in this pathway. Early findings suggest benefit in metastatic disease, although the role in superficial bladder cancer remains unclear.

Programmed cell death-1 ligand-1 (PD-L1) expression has been associated with prognostic implications in urologic malignancies. We aimed to investigate prognostic significance of pre- and post-treatment PD-L1 expression in patients treated with BCG for high-grade non-muscle-invasive bladder cancer (NMIBC). We reviewed a total of 141 high-grade NMIBC cases treated with transurethral resection +  ≥ 6 BCG instillations between 2004 and 2017. PD-L1 immunohistochemistry (IHC) scoring was done on 0-3 scale, and cut-off for positive and high-level PD-L1 expression was set to ≥ 1% and ≥ 5% staining of tumor-infiltrating immune cells (IC), respectively. Clinicopathologic characteristics and oncologic outcomes [recurrence-free (RFS) and progression-free survival (PFS)] were compared, stratified by PD-L1 positivity. The prognostic role of PD-L1 was assessed using Kaplan-Meier, and univariate and multivariate Cox regression analyses. Pre-treatment, 46.2% and 6.8% of high-grade NMIBC demonstrated positive and high-level PD-L1 expression, respectively. Positive PD-L1 expression was associated with submucosal invasion and refractory-tumor recurrence. PD-L1 expression was not associated with RFS or PFS in regression analysis. Post-treatment, 55.1% and 11.6% of recurrent tumors demonstrated positive and high-level PD-L1 expression, respectively. Down-regulation of PD-L1 expression was noted in patients with refractory recurrence (p = 0.012). Pre-treatment PD-L1 expression was associated with unfavorable pathological features in primary high-grade NMIBC and its expression level after BCG immunotherapy was significantly decreased in patients with refractory recurrence. PD-L1 expression did not have prognostic value for PFS or RFS; therefore, further research is necessary to identify novel biomarkers for prediction of disease outcomes in high-grade NMIBC.

Over the past 7 years, 151 patients with malignant melanoma have been treated with BCG immunotherapy alone or as an adjunct to surgical therapy. Direct injection of metastatic melanoma lesions limited to skin resulted in 90% regression of injected lesions and 17% regression of uninjected lesions in immunocompetent patients. Approximately 25% of these patients remained free of disease for 1 to 6 years. Direct injections of BCG into nodules of patients with subcutaneous or visceral metastases resulted in a lower incidence of local control and no long term survivors. Attempts to improve the results of immunotherapy in these patients by palliative surgical resection of large metastatic lesions to lower tumor burden followed by BCG immunotherapy significantly improved the results although many patients still developed recurrent disease. Early results of a clinical trial combining BCG immunotherapy with regional lymphadenectomy in patients with melanoma metastatic to lymph nodes have been encouraging and promising. Further controlled clinical trials are necessary to elucidate the role of BCG in immunotherapy. However, since BCG is but one of a number of potential immunologic adjuvants, even more effective immunotherapy will be possible as further knowledge of the interactions of cellular and humoral immunity is acquired.

Initial adjuvant immunotherapy trials have demonstrated a greater disease-free interval in patients treated with bacille Calmette-Guérin (BCG) compared with historical controls. In this study 149 patients at high risk of recurrence after surgical treatment of local or regional malignant melanoma were given BCG for 2 years and were followed up for a median of 28 months from the start of immunotherapy. The 36 patients in the comparison group had a higher rate of recurrence than the patients treated with BCG, and the rate in the treatment group was close to that reported from a similar study at the University of California at Los Angeles. The relatively long disease-free interval for the high-risk comparison patients in this study suggests that the control groups at other centres may have included patients with unrecognized additional risk. The rates of survival in the Canadian treatment group were also comparable to those reported by other centres. However, reports of a favourable BCG-mediated pattern of recurrence could not be confirmed. Therefore, the routine use of adjuvant BCG immunotherapy is not recommended.

Bacillus Calmette-Guérin (BCG) immunotherapy is regarded as the current treatment of choice for stage T1 grade 3 (T1G3) bladder cancer (BC), though its efficacy is limited by high recurrence and progression rate. Identification of molecular prognosticators that might be helpful in discriminating between responders and nonresponders to BCG treatment is therefore of major clinical importance; thus we focused on the cell-cycle related retinoblastoma protein (pRB), which had been already investigated in bladder cancer. The goal of our study was specifically to address whether its expression predicts the outcomes of BCG treatment for patients with T1G3 disease. To address this issue, paraffin-embedded specimens of 27 patients having undergone transurethral resection of T1G3 BC and intravesical instillations of BCG (induction + 1 year maintenance) were immunostained with pRB monoclonal antibody. Patients in whom the bladder muscle was not clearly visible, and healthy, as well as patients with TaG3 tumors or with concomitant carcinoma in situ were excluded. Mean follow-up was 60 months (range 15-135). Thirteen tumors showed normal (1% to 50% labeling index) while 14 showed altered pRB expression, consisting of no expression (0% labeling index) in six and overexpression (>50% labeling index) in eight. Recurrence occurred in 10 (37%) patients and mean time to recurrence was 22.8 months (range 6-48). Recurrence rate was 57% in patients with altered and 15% in those with normal pRB expression, with a statistically significant difference in disease-free survival (P = 0.037). Progression occurred in five (18.5%) patients and mean time to progression was 24 months (range 6-48). Progression rate was 36% in patients with altered and 0% in patients with normal pRB expression, with a statistically significant difference in progression-free survival (P = 0.018). In this homogeneous population of T1G3 bladder tumors, altered pRB expression predicted recurrence and progression after BCG treatment. These findings outline the potential role of pRB immunostaining in predicting T1G3 BC response to BCG immunotherapy.

The advantage of BCG immunotherapy over intravesical chemotherapy in superficial bladder cancer has been most apparent in patients with carcinoma in situ (CIS), where complete response is increased from 50% to more than 70% and the proportion of patients remaining disease free for 5 years is increased from 20% to 40%. Similar advantages have been reported using suboptimal BCG treatment schedules in patients with recurrent stage Ta, T1 tumours. BCG provides long term protection from tumour recurrence and, unlike chemotherapy, reduces tumour progression. The observed relative increased sensitivity of CIS to BCG and the occasional failure of BCG to demonstrate significant superiority over mitomycin C in the prevention of tumour appear to be related to the use of suboptimal BCG treatment schedules. With maintenance BCG using 3 weekly instillations at 6 month intervals, patients with papillary tumours fare even better than patients with CIS, and tumour progressio is even further reduceld. Chemotherapy is appropriate for patients who are at very low risk of tumour progression and those who fail to respond to BCG, but overall the results of BCG immunotherapy are superior for patients with either CIS or Ta, T1 transitional cell carcinoma.

Fifty-one patients with confirmed bladder cancer have enrolled in a prospective evaluation of BCG immunotherapy. Following resection of existing tumors, patients were stratified according to tumor grade and number of previous recurrences and randomly assigned to control or BCG treatment groups. Immunotherapy consisted of six weekly administrations of Pasteur strain BCG using 120 mg intravesically and 5 mg percutaneously. Immunotherapy side effects were minimal and no patient required postponement of BCG treatments. Eleven control (46%) compared with five (22%) BCG-treated patients had tumor recurrence (P = 0.078, chi 2). Prolongation of the disease-free interval with BCG treatment was significantly at the P = 0.016 level by Wilcoxon analysis. Four control and two BCG-treated patients had multiple recurrences. Comparing total episodes of recurrence, nineteen of 79 (24%) control and eight of 85 (7%) BCG group cystoscopic examinations revealed tumor (P = 0.006, chi 2). Immunologic correlates of response to immunotherapy were not statistically significant since only five BCG-treated patients had tumor recurrence. However, four of these five patients evidenced impaired LIF response to PPD at the time of tumor recurrence, and impairment of skin test reactivity and BCG humoral antibody response were more commonly seen in this subgroup of patients.

Intravesical immunotherapy with bacille Calmette-Guérin (BCG) vaccine is the main treatment for non-muscle-invasive bladder cancer (NMIBC), with proven effects on reducing recurrence, progression, and death from NMIBC. However, it is not effective in all patients, and recurrence after adequate BCG therapy can frequently lead to progression to more life-threatening disease. This point-counterpoint review considers how to treat a healthy 60-yr-old patient with T1 high-grade NMIBC fitting the new definition of BCG-unresponsive disease, that is, persistent high-grade disease at 6-12mo, despite an adequate course of induction and maintenance with BCG. PATIENT SUMMARY: When T1 high-grade non-muscle-invasive bladder cancer is persistent or recurs shortly after a full course of bacille Calmette-Guérin (BCG) plus maintenance, further BCG is not likely to work; this meets the new definition of a "BCG unresponsive" disease. For this situation, the safest (curative) option is removal of the bladder. If that is not an accepted alternative, then a clinical trial or combination intravesical chemotherapy or hyperchemotherapy may be another option.

High risk of recurrence/progression bladder tumours is treated with Bacillus Calmette-Guérin (BCG) immunotherapy after complete resection of the tumour. Approximately 75% of these tumours express the uncommon carbohydrate antigen sialyl-Tn (Tn), a surrogate biomarker of tumour aggressiveness. Such changes in the glycosylation of cell-surface proteins influence tumour microenvironment and immune responses that may modulate treatment outcome and the course of disease. The aim of this work is to determine the efficiency of BCG immunotherapy against tumours expressing sTn and sTn-related antigen sialyl-6-T (s6T). In a retrospective design, 94 tumours from patients treated with BCG were screened for sTn and s6T expression. In vitro studies were conducted to determine the interaction of BCG with high-grade bladder cancer cell line overexpressing sTn. From the 94 cases evaluated, 36 had recurrence after BCG treatment (38.3%). Treatment outcome was influenced by age over 65 years (HR=2.668; (1.344-5.254); P=0.005), maintenance schedule (HR=0.480; (0.246-0.936); P=0.031) and multifocality (HR=2.065; (1.033-4.126); P=0.040). sTn or s6T expression was associated with BCG response (P=0.024; P<0.0001) and with increased recurrence-free survival (P=0.001). Multivariate analyses showed that sTn and/or s6T were independent predictive markers of recurrence after BCG immunotherapy (HR=0.296; (0.148-0.594); P=0.001). In vitro studies demonstrated higher adhesion and internalisation of the bacillus to cells expressing sTn, promoting cell death. s6T is described for the first time in bladder tumours. Our data strongly suggest that BCG immunotherapy is efficient against sTn- and s6T-positive tumours. Furthermore, sTn and s6T expression are independent predictive markers of BCG treatment response and may be useful in the identification of patients who could benefit more from this immunotherapy.

Intravesical immunotherapy with Mycobacterium bovis (M. bovis) bacillus Calmette-Guerin (BCG) is the current standard of care against superficial, high-grade transitional cell carcinoma (TCC) of the urinary bladder (carcinoma in situ and pathologic T1, grade 3 disease). However, individual patient outcome is barely predictable because of the lack of serum markers. Consequently, progression to muscle-invasive bladder cancer and critical delay of treatments (such as neoadjuvant combination chemotherapy and/or radical cystectomy) often occur. The objectives of this study were to identify a marker for measuring the BCG-induced immune response and to predict the outcomes and potential improvements of BCG immunotherapy. Because host immunoresponse mediates BCG activity, the authors screened a combinatorial random peptide library on the circulating pool of immunoglobulins (Igs) purified from an index patient after successful BCG immunotherapy to identify the corresponding target antigen(s). An immunogenic peptide motif was selected, isolated, and validated from M. bovis BCG heat-shock protein 65 (HSP-65) as a dominant epitope of the humoral response to treatment. Increasing IgA and IgG anti-HSP-65 titers specifically predicted a positive patient outcome in a cohort of patients with bladder cancer relative to several cohorts of control patients. The current results indicated that antibody production against M. bovis BCG HSP-65 can serve as a serologic marker for the predictive outcome of BCG immunotherapy. Subsequent studies will determine the value of this candidate marker to modify BCG-based treatment for individual patients with bladder cancer.

Transitional cell carcinoma (TCC) of the bladder makes up 90% of bladder cancers. The approach to the management of localized TCC includes accurate clinical and histologic diagnosis and staging with pathologic material obtained through endoscopy. Once the diagnosis of superficial TCC has been established, histologically based prognostic factors guide which therapy or combination of therapies is indicated in the management of individual patients. Surgery alone (transurethral resection) is appropriate initial therapy for noninvasive papillary TCC. For lamina propria invasive tumors and carcinoma in situ, intravesical immunotherapy with bacille Calmette-Guérin (BCG) is often the first line of treatment to decrease tumor recurrence and to possibly decrease progression and improve survival. Intravesical chemotherapy and interferon are alternative therapies that can also decrease recurrence rates. For BCG-refractory TCC, durable response rates with alternative intravesical therapies are low. For superficial TCC that is refractory to endoscopic procedures and intravesical agents or for disease progression, radical cystectomy with neobladder formation or other forms of urinary diversion is the treatment of choice.

The results of various in vitro analyses indicate there is an active immune response against antigens associated with human malignancies. This immune response apparently can be augmented by nonspecific immunologic stimulates such as BCG. These agents are effective for destroying tumor when injected locally into intracutaneous disease but are not as effective for subcutaneous disease. Preliminary clinical trials indicated that immune stimulants are effective when administered systemically. The effect is only minimal for diseminated disease, but the therapeutic benefit is clearly augmented for patients with a minimal residual tumor burden, such as those patients with metastases to regional lymph nodes. Thus immunotherapy is a systemically active mode of therapy. Its toxicity is minimal, and it appears to be effective in a wide spectrum of the disease. However, immunotherapy is not effective for a large residual tumor burden; consequently it must be used in combination with other modes of treatment such as irradiation therapy or chemotherapy. Early experiences with BCG immunotherapy for malignant melanoma and C. parvum for oat cell carcinoma are encouraging. It is remarkable that a nonspecific immunologic stimulant does, in fact, have this effect. Immunotherapy experiments in animals suggest that in order to achieve maximal benefit. BCG must have close contact with tumor cells or must be combined with a tumor-associated antigen. If these principles are true for man, it would seem that improvements for nonspecific immunotherapy in human neoplasms would be further augmented if a tumor-related antigen could be extracted from human tumours and combined with a nonspecific immunologic stimulant.

There is a significant unmet need for efficacious second-line treatment options for patients who have failed bacillus Calmette-Guerin (BCG) therapy for nonmuscle invasive urothelial carcinoma (NMIBC). Recent advances in our understanding of systemic immunotherapy have transformed the management of advanced urothelial carcinoma and have led to the development of multiple novel agents. Using this insight, these agents are now being investigated for use in NMIBC. Although BCG has been used to treat high-risk NMIBC for decades, new applications of immunotherapy include the use of exogenous cytokines to boost immune response, vaccines to activate the immune system against specific tumor-associated antigens, intravesical agents that cause generalized local inflammation, and targeted antibodies against proteins on the surface of immune checkpoint inhibitors. Although most of these agents are still being investigated in clinical trials and are not yet considered standard of care, they hold significant promise in the treatment of patients with high-risk NMIBC. The use of immunotherapy has significantly improved survival outcomes in advanced urothelial carcinoma. Based on rapid advances in our understanding of the immune system and tumor biology, these agents are also poised to alter the therapeutic landscape for NMIBC dramatically as clinical trials are completed.

Intravesical therapy has been used in the management of superficial transitional cell carcinoma (TCC) of the urinary bladder (i.e., Ta, Tl, and carcinoma in situ) with specific objectives which include treating existing/residual tumor, preventing recurrence of tumor, preventing disease progression, and prolonging survival. The initial clinical stage and grade remain the main determinant factors in survival irrespective of the treatment. Presently, bacillus Calmette-Guerin (BCG) immunotherapy remains the most effective treatment and prophylaxis for TCC (Ta, Tl, CIS) and has positive outcomes on tumor recurrence rate, disease progression, and prolongation of survival. Prostatic urethral mucosal involvement with bladder cancer can be effectively treated with BCG intravesical immunotherapy-it has demonstrated a reduction in tumor recurrence rates, but has had no positive impact on disease progression or prolongation of survival. Interferons, keyhole-limpet hemocyanin (KLH), bropirimine, and PHOTOFRIN-photodynamic therapy (PDT) are under investigation in the management of TCC and early results are encouraging. This comprehensive review highlights recent developments in intravesical therapy of bladder cancer and summarizes the mechanisms of action of BCG, and the important role of intravesical BCG immunotherapy and other immunotherapeutic agents in the therapy and prophylaxis of superficial TCC of the urinary bladder.

A handful of therapeutic procedures are used to treat malignancies of the urinary tract, most frequently intravesical immunotherapy or chemotherapy, but also neoadjuvant systemic chemotherapy. These treatment modalities produce morphological changes in the urothelium that can be mistaken for carcinoma; in particular, these therapies frequently mimic urothelial carcinoma in situ (CIS) urothelial dysplasia or true invasive neoplasia. Drugs such as mitomycin C used after transurethral resection of bladder tumour to reduce recurrences, bacillus Calmette-Guérin (BCG) intravesical immunotherapy to treat high-risk non-muscle-invasive bladder cancer and urothelial CIS and platin-based systemic chemotherapy to improve postcystectomy disease-specific survival are examples of therapy-related atypia seen in the urinary tract. To complicate the pathologist's life, a number of systemic drugs in use to treat other diseases, such cyclophosphamide, used to treat some autoimmune disorders or certain haematological malignancies or, in the case of anaesthetics, ketamine, used increasingly as an illegal recreational drug, may produce similarly relevant atypical changes in the urothelium, and therefore need to be differentiated from intraepithelial neoplasia. Other less frequent procedures, such as photodynamic and laser therapy or the newer gene therapy to treat urothelial neoplasia, remain experimental. An immunohistochemical approach to reactive urothelium versus carcinoma in situ using p53, cytokeratin 20 and CD44 is also valid in the post-therapy setting. The pathologist should be aware of these novelties, as he or she plays a crucial role in evaluating treatment efficacy, but at the same time needs to avoid misdiagnosing secondary atypia as intraepithelial neoplasia.

Despite current surgical therapy, about 80 per cent of patients with malignant melanoma metastatic to lymph nodes succumb to systemic metastatic disease. To determine if postoperative adjuvant immunization with BCG was an effective systemic treatment in these patients with microscopic subclinical metastatic disease, the clinical course of 42 patients treated by operation alone was compared with that of 84 treated by operation and BCG. At two years, the incidence of metastasis in BCG-treated patients was half that of the control group. BCG was more effective in patients with a smaller tumor burden at the time of initial surgical treatment. In patients receiving BCG adjuvant therapy, 90 per cent with microscopic disease in one lymph node appeared free of disease as compared to 40 per cent with macroscopic disease in multiple nodes. In patients with recurrences, an immunotherapeutic effect was demonstrated by a delay of six months in the time to recurrence. Thus, BCG immunotherapy appears to have an inhibiting effect on the "micrometastases" of malignant melanoma.

Prior to the advent of BCG immunotherapy, bladder carcinoma in situ often progressed to muscle invasion. Intravesical chemotherapy completely eradicates the disease in 50% of patients, but fewer than 20% remain disease free after 5 years. Complete responses have been reported in 70% or more of BCG treated patients, nearly two-thirds of which are durable. Controversy over the optimal induction and maintenance regimens for BCG immunotherapy remain, but SWOG investigators have demonstrated that complete response rates can be increased from the expected 73% to 87% with just three additional BCG instillations given at 3 months. In complete responders, maintenance BCG using three weekly treatments at 6-month intervals improves long-term complete response rates from 65% to nearly 90%. Caution must be exercised to avoid serious side effects.

Intravesical Mycobacterium bovis bacillus Calmette-Guérin (BCG) immunotherapy is a highly effective treatment for carcinoma in situ of the bladder, as well as high-risk nonmuscle invasive urothelial carcinoma of the bladder. Despite over 30 years of clinical experience with BCG, the therapy's mechanism has remained enigmatic. Observations regarding the role of neutrophils in BCG immunotherapy have led to exciting discoveries regarding the potential role of tumor necrosis factor-related apoptosis-inducing ligand (TRAIL) in creating the therapeutic benefit of BCG immunotherapy. In this paper, we will review the scope of the disease, highlight our understanding of the role for BCG in urothelial carcinoma of the bladder, explain the recent discoveries regarding the role of neutrophils and TRAIL in therapy, and theorize on potential future areas of research.

The standard of care for most patients with non-muscle-invasive bladder cancer (NMIBC) is immunotherapy with intravesical Bacillus Calmette-Guérin (BCG), which activates the immune system to recognize and destroy malignant cells and has demonstrated durable clinical benefit. Urologic best-practice guidelines and consensus reports have been developed and strengthened based on data on the timing, dose, and duration of therapy from randomized clinical trials, as well as by critical evaluation of criteria for progression. However, these reports have not penetrated the community, and many patients do not receive appropriate therapy. Additionally, several immune checkpoint inhibitors have recently been approved for treatment of metastatic disease. The approval of immune checkpoint blockade for patients with platinum-resistant or -ineligible metastatic bladder cancer has led to considerations of expanded use for both advanced and, potentially, localized disease. To address these issues and others surrounding the appropriate use of immunotherapy for the treatment of bladder cancer, the Society for Immunotherapy of Cancer (SITC) convened a Task Force of experts, including physicians, patient advocates, and nurses, to address issues related to patient selection, toxicity management, clinical endpoints, as well as the combination and sequencing of therapies. Following the standard approach established by the Society for other cancers, a systematic literature review and analysis of data, combined with consensus voting was used to generate guidelines. Here, we provide a consensus statement for the use of immunotherapy in patients with bladder cancer, with plans to update these recommendations as the field progresses.

Non-muscle-invasive bladder cancer (NMIBC) is usually effectively treated with transurethral resection (TUR), most often followed by intravesical instillation of bacillus Calmette-Guérin (BCG) or intravesical chemotherapy. Although the precise mechanism of BCG immunotherapy is still unclear, a local immune response is presumed. However, a number of severe side effects and complications are related to intravesical immunotherapy. Aim of this report is to present rare case of the renal granulomatous disease in a patient previously treated with intravesical instillation of BCG immunotherapy, following TURBT. In addition, we performed review of previously reported cases of renal granulomas following intravesical BCG immunotherapy. A 79-year-old man was presented to Urology Clinic due to clinically verified tumor of the urinary bladder. After transurethral resection of bladder tumor, histopathological analysis revealed the diagnosis of papillary urothelial high-grade pT1 carcinoma. Intravesical BCG immunotherapy was initiated, according to protocol currently used in our institution. Upon completion of therapy with BCG, we re-examined the patient and, using ultrasound, found a change in the right kidney, resembling moth bites not seen on CT scan before TURBT. Additionally, CT-guided core-needle biopsy of the affected kidney was performed, and the specimen was sent for histopathological analysis, which revealed chronic necrotizing granulomatous inflammation. Antituberculotic therapy was initiated for 6 months. Upon completion of antituberculotic therapy, control CT-scan was performed at follow-up, indicating regression of changes on the right kidney. This case report emphasizes the importance of consistent implementation of follow-up protocol and the identification of lesions during the asymptomatic period and enables the proper treatment of the disease. To reduce the incidence of adverse effects of BCG treatment for bladder tumors, an individualized approach is needed.

In the past three decades, intravesical instillation of Mycobacterium bovis bacille Calmette-Guérin (BCG) has been used for treating bladder cancer and it still remains at the forefront of immunotherapy for cancer patients. Although BCG-based therapy is the most effective intravesical therapy for this kind of tumor and represents the only agent known to reduce progression into muscle invasive bladder cancer, BCG is ineffective in approximately 30-40 % of cases and disease recurs in up to 50 % of patients. Since that BCG is considered an effective vehicle for delivery of antigens due to its unique characteristics, the genetic manipulation of these mycobacteria has been appealing in the search for less toxic and more potent therapeutic agents for bladder cancer immunotherapy. Herein, we discuss current advances in recombinant BCG construction, research, concerns, and future directions to promote the development of this promising immunotherapeutic approach for bladder cancer.
