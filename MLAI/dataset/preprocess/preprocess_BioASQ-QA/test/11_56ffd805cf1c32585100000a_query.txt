Which is the main difference between Alu and B1 repeats?

[PMID: 20019790]
Alu and B1 repeats are mobile elements that originated in an initial duplication of the 7SL RNA gene prior to the primate-rodent split about 80 million years ago and currently account for a substantial fraction of the human and mouse genome, respectively. Following the primate-rodent split, Alu and B1 elements spread independently in each of the two genomes in a seemingly random manner, and, according to the prevailing hypothesis, negative selection shaped their final distribution in each genome by forcing the selective loss of certain Alu and B1 copies. In this paper, contrary to the prevailing hypothesis, we present evidence that Alu and B1 elements have been selectively retained in the upstream and intronic regions of genes belonging to specific functional classes. At the same time, we found no evidence for selective loss of these elements in any functional class. A subset of the functional links we discovered corresponds to functions where Alu involvement has actually been experimentally validated, whereas the majority of the functional links we report are novel. Finally, the unexpected finding that Alu and B1 elements show similar biases in their distribution across functional classes, despite having spread independently in their respective genomes, further supports our claim that the extant instances of Alu and B1 elements are the result of positive selection.

We have determined sequences of PCR-amplified B1 elements from hamster and rat (Myomorpha), chipmunk (Sciuromorpha), and guinea pig (Caviomorpha). Between three and six B1 subfamilies were found in these species. In the phylogenetic analysis B1 sequences of hamster, mouse, and rat clustered separately from those of chipmunk and those of guinea pig. This is consistent with an independent evolution of B1 elements in separate rodent lineages. We exclude the possibility of convergent mutations to explain certain diagnostic characters within the modern B1 quasi-dimers and view these elements as mosaic structures assembling preexisting mutations. Furthermore, the presence of Alu-like structural motifs supports the hypothesis of the monophyletic origin of Alu and B1 repeats, i.e., from a common 7SL RNA-derived retroposing monomeric element.

Alus and B1s are short interspersed repeat elements (SINEs) derived from the 7SL RNA gene. Alus and B1s exist in the cytoplasm as non-coding RNA indicating that they are actively transcribed, but their function, if any, is unknown. Transcription of individual SINEs is a prerequisite for retroposition, but it is also possible that individual Alu and B1 elements have some cellular functions. Previous studies suggest that transcription of Alu elements depends on the presence of an RNA polymerase-III bipartite promoter and the poly-A tail. Sequencing of small RNAs has demonstrated that the members of the Y and S subfamily are expressed. We analyzed almost one million Alu sequences longer than 200 nucleotides for the presence of RNA polymerase-III bipartite promoter sequences. More than half contained a promoter indicating some potential for expression. We searched 7.7 million human EST sequences in dbEST for the presence of Alu non-coding RNAs and found evidence for the expression of 452. Analysis of mouse spermatogenic dbEST libraries revealed an apparent relationship between the level of differentiation and the level of B1-related sequences in the EST library.

The Alu sequence family comprises the major dispersed repeat sequences of rodent and primate genomes, numbering greater than 300,000 copies in the human haploid genome. The function of these elements is unknown. The sequences can be transcribed by RNA polymerase III and represent a substantial fraction of total heterogeneous nuclear RNA. Alu sequences can be found both in the flanking regions and within the transcription units of several well-characterized genes. Here we show that some members of the mouse B1 Alu sequence family encode a small cytoplasmic RNA. The mouse B1 sequence is congruent to 130 nucleotides long and shows homology with the monomeric units of the dimeric 300-nucleotide primate sequence. By means of microinjection studies in the Xenopus laevis oocyte, we have elucidated a novel pathway leading to the appearance of a processed B1-type Alu RNA species in the cytoplasm. The abundance of this small Alu RNA differs between various mouse tissues, suggesting a role in tissue-specific gene expression.

B1 and Alu are sequence-homologous interspersed elements of unknown function that have expanded in the genomes of mice and humans, respectively. A minority of B1 and Alu sequences are expressed as small cytoplasmic RNAs. These RNAs have conserved a secondary structure motif also present in signal recognition particle (SRP) RNA despite substantial sequence divergence, whereas random B1 and Alu sequences have not. This RNA structure has also been conserved by the source sequences that gave rise to successive transpositions during B1 and Alu evolution. In the present work small cytoplasmic B1 and Alu RNAs synthesized in vitro were found to bind a cellular protein by mobility shift and UV cross-linking analyses. The mouse and human proteins demonstrate the same specificity to a panel of competitor RNAs. Results using mutated B1 RNA indicate that a single strand loop in the conserved Alu motif is essential for binding. Previous work by Strub et al. (Stub, K., Moss, J. B., and Walter, P. (1991) Mol. Cell. Biol. 11, 3949-3959) demonstrated that the Alu-specific protein SRP 9/14 does not footprint to this region of SRP RNA. This observation coupled with the failure of anti-SRP/9 antibodies to identify SRP 9/14 in the B1 RNA-protein complex as well as the apparent mass and other characteristics of the protein described here suggest that it is a novel B1-Alu RNA-binding protein. Conservation of primary and secondary structure by B1 and Alu small cytoplasmic RNAs as well as features of their specific expression and ability to interact with the conserved binding protein indicate that these RNAs are more homologous than previously appreciated.

B1 (Alu-equivalent) is a murine short interspersed element whose amplification probably involved an RNA intermediate. B1-homologous RNA comprise a population of heterogenous transcripts of questionable function. A cloned B1 is expressed in the injected frog oocyte by RNA polymerase III transcription, ribonucleoprotein formation, post-transcriptional 3'-processing, and nucleocytoplasmic transport. The present study characterizes small cytoplasmic B1 transcripts of mouse cells. Analyses of ten cDNA clones revealed a subset of a high degree of sequence identity (98%) from which a novel consensus was developed. Structural analyses of these RNAs demonstrated a conserved Alu domain originally identified as part of the 7SL RNA within the translational control domain of the signal recognition particle, while this structure was not conserved in the majority of B1s in the sequence database. Furthermore, it was demonstrated that 3'-processing occurred in only a subset of B1 transcripts in-vitro using homologous nuclear extracts, and in the injected oocyte. The data demonstrate that a limited set of B1 sequences are expressed as processed RNA polymerase III-transcripts of a high degree of structural conservation. Although this subset is transcriptionally active, the selective expression may be due to regulation at the levels of processing and cytoplasmic accumulation. Their lack of Poly-(A) or 3'-oligo-(U) tracts argue that these RNAs are unlikely to represent transposition intermediates. Rather, their cytosolic compartmentalization and conservation of a biologically recognized structure, suggests potential involvement in other aspects of cellular metabolism.

A complex study on various evolutionary peculiarities of the mammalia dispersed Alu repeats (Alu repeats of primates and B1 of rodents) has been carried out by phylogenetic analysis. A phylogenetic tree, containing the 7SL RNA genes and the Alu repeats of primates and rodents has been constructed. It has been shown that the branch of the phyletic line leading to the Alu repeats of primates and B1 of rodents from the 7SL RNA genes occurred after the divergence of the 7SL RNA genes of amphibia and mammalia, but before the divergence of the 7SL RNA genes of primates and rodents (250.10 years ago). A statistically reliable slowing down in the evolutionary rates of one of two monomers for the human Alu repeats has been proved. It may be caused by the functional load of the corresponding monomer in connection with the presence of a definit regulatory site in it.

Efficient synthesis of many small abundant RNAs is achieved by the proficient recycling of RNA polymerase (pol) III and stable transcription complexes. Cellular Alu and related retroposons represent unusual pol III genes that are normally repressed but are activated by viral infection and other conditions. The core sequences of these elements contain pol III promoters but must rely on fortuitous downstream oligo(dT) tracts for terminator function. We show that a B1-Alu gene differs markedly from a classical pol III gene (tRNAiMet) in terminator sequence requirements. B1-Alu genes that differ only in terminator sequence context direct differential RNA 3' end formation. These genes are assembled into stable transcription complexes but differ in their ability to be recycled in the presence of the La transcription termination factor. La binds to the nascent RNA 3' UUUOH end motif that is generated by transcriptional termination within the pol III termination signal, oligo(dT). We found that the recycling efficiency of the B1-Alu genes is correlated with the ability of La to access the 3' end of the nascent transcript and protect it from 3'-5' exonucleolytic processing. These results illuminate a relationship between RNA 3' end formation and transcription termination, and La-mediated reinitiation by pol III.

The dispersion of short interspersed elements (SINEs) probably occurred through an RNA intermediate. B1 is a murine homolog of the human SINE Alu; these elements are composed of 5' G + C-rich regions juxtaposed to A-rich tracts and are flanked by direct repeats. Internal promoters direct RNA polymerase III to transcribe B1 and Alu elements and proceed into the 3' flanking DNA until it reaches a (dT)4 termination signal. The resulting transcripts contain 3'-terminal oligo(U) tracts which can presumably base pair with the A-rich tract to form self-primed templates for reverse transcriptase and retrotransposition. Nuclear extracts from mouse tissue culture cells contain an RNA processing activity that removes the A-rich and 3'-terminal regions from purified B1 RNAs (R. Maraia, Nucleic Acids Res. 19:5695-5702, 1991). In this study, we examined transcription and RNA processing in these nuclear extracts. In contrast to results with use of purified RNA, nascent transcripts synthesized in nuclear extract by RNA polymerase III are not processed, suggesting that the transposition-intermediate-like RNA is shielded from processing by a protein(s). Alteration of an AATTTT TAA termination signal to a GCTTTTGC signal activated processing by greater than 100-fold in coupled transcription/processing reactions. A similar difference was found when expression was compared in frog oocytes. No difference in processing was found if the transcripts were made by T7 RNA polymerase in the presence of the nuclear extract, indicating that the different processing effects of the two terminators were dependent on synthesis by polymerase III. The modulation of processing of B1-Alu transcripts and the potential for retrotransposition of B1 and Alu DNA sequences are discussed.

The question of the origin of the B1 family of rodents is addressed. The modern B1 elements are similar to the left Alu monomer, but with a 9 bp deletion and a 29 bp duplication. Search of databases for B1 elements that do not exhibit those modern features revealed sequence fragments that are very similar to the free left Alu monomers (FLAMs) described in the primate genomes. In addition, the analysis reveals elements that have 10 bp or 7 bp deletion in place of the 9 bp deletion but without the 29 bp tandem duplication. The elements described define families of proto B1 elements (referred as PB1, PB1D10 and PB1D7) that appeared before the first modern B1 element. A phylogenetic reconstruction suggest that the origin of Alu and B1 families took place before the divergence between the primate and the rodent lineages and that each family has followed different evolutionary routes since this radiation.

Alus and B1s are short interspersed repeat elements (SINEs) indirectly derived from the 7SL RNA gene. While most researchers recognize that there exists extensive variability between individual elements, the extent of this variability has never been systematically tested. We examined all Alu elements over 200 nucleotides and all B1 elements over 100 nucleotides in the human and mouse genomes, and analyzed the number of copies of each element at various stringencies from 22 nucleotides to full length. Over 98% of 923,277 Alus and 365,377 B1s examined were unique when queried at full length. When the criterion was reduced to half the length of the repeat, 97% of the Alus and 73% of the B1s were still found to be a single copy. All single and multi-copy sequences have been mapped and documented. Access to the data is possible using the AluPlus website http://www.ibr.hawaii.edu.
