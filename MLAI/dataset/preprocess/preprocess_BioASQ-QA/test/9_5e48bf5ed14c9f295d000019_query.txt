Salzburg EEG criteria are used to diagnose which disorder?

[PMID: 27571157]
Several EEG criteria have been proposed for diagnosis of non-convulsive status epilepticus (NCSE), but none have been clinically validated. We aimed to assess the diagnostic accuracy of the EEG criteria proposed by a panel of experts at the fourth London-Innsbruck Colloquium on Status Epilepticus in Salzburg, 2013 (henceforth called the Salzburg criteria). We did a retrospective, diagnostic accuracy study using EEG recordings from patients admitted for neurological symptoms or signs to three centres in two countries (Danish Epilepsy Centre, Dianalund, Denmark; Aarhus University Hospital, Aarhus, Denmark; and Paracelsus Medical University, Salzburg, Austria). Participants were included from the Danish centres if they were aged 4 months or older, and from the Austrian centre if aged 18 years or older. Participants were sorted into two groups: consecutive patients under clinical suspicion of having NCSE (the clinical validation group) or consecutive patients with abnormal EEG findings but no clinical suspicion of NCSE (the control group). Two raters blinded to all other patient data retrospectively analysed the EEG recordings and, using the Salzburg criteria, categorised patients as in NCSE or not in NCSE. By comparing with a reference standard inferred from all clinical and para-clinical data, therapeutic response, and the final outcome, we calculated sensitivity, specificity, overall diagnostic accuracy, positive and negative predictive values, and inter-rater agreement for the Salzburg criteria. The reference standard was inferred by two raters who were blinded to the scorings of the Salzburg criteria. We retrospectively reviewed EEG data from 220 patients. EEGs in the clinical validation group were recorded in 120 patients between Jan 1, and Feb 28, 2014 (Austria), and Aug 1, 2014, and Jan 31, 2015 (Denmark). EEGs in the control group were recorded in 100 patients between Jan 13 and Jan 22, 2014 (Austria) and Jan 12 and Jan 26, 2015 (Denmark). According to the reference standard, 43 (36%) of the 120 patients in the validation group had NCSE. In the validation cohort sensitivity was 97·7% (95% CI 87·9-99·6) and specificity was 89·6% (80·8-94·6); overall accuracy was 92·5% (88·3-97·5). Positive predictive value was 84·0% (95% CI 74·1-91·5) and negative predictive value was 98·6% (94·4-100). Three people in the control group (n=100) fulfilled the Salzburg criteria and were therefore false positives (specificity 97·0%, 95% CI 91·5-99·0; sensitivity not calculable). Inter-rater agreement was high for both the Salzburg criteria (k=0·87) and for the reference standard (k=0·95). Therapeutic changes occurred significantly more often in the group of patients fulfilling Salzburg criteria (42 [84%] of 50 patients) than in those who did not (11 [16%] of 70; p<0·0001). The Salzburg criteria for diagnosis of NCSE have high diagnostic accuracy and excellent inter-rater agreement, making them suitable for implementation in clinical practice. None.

Salzburg Consensus Criteria for diagnosis of Non-Convulsive Status Epilepticus (SCNC) were proposed at the 4th London-Innsbruck Colloquium on status epilepticus in Salzburg (2013). We retrospectively analyzed the EEGs of 50 consecutive nonhypoxic patients with diagnoses of nonconvulsive status epilepticus (NCSE) at discharge and 50 consecutive controls with abnormal EEGs in a large university hospital in Austria. We implemented the American Clinical Neurophysiology Society's Standardized Critical Care EEG Terminology, 2012 version (ACNS criteria) to increase the test performance of SCNC. In patients without preexisting epileptic encephalopathy, the following criteria were applied: (1) more than 25 epileptiform discharges (ED) per 10-second epoch, i.e., >2.5/s and (2) patients with EDs ≤ 2.5/s or rhythmic delta/theta activity (RDT) exceeding 0.5/s AND at least one of the additional criteria: (2a) clinical and EEG improvements from antiepileptic drugs (AEDs), (2b) subtle clinical phenomena, or (2c) typical spatiotemporal evolution. In case of fluctuation without evolution or EEG improvement without clinical improvement, "possible NCSE" was diagnosed. For identification of RDT, the following criteria were compared: (test condition A) continuous delta-theta activity without further rules, (B) ACNS criterion for rhythmic delta activity (RDA), and (C) ACNS criteria for RDA and fluctuation. False positive rate in controls dropped from 28% (condition A) to 2% (B) (p = 0.00039) and finally to 0% (C) (p = 0.000042). Application of test condition C in the group with NCSE gives one false negative (2%). Various EEG patterns were found in patients with NCSE: (1) 8.2%, (2a) 2%, (2b) 12.2%, and (2c) 32.7%. Possible NCSE was diagnosed based on fluctuations in 57.1% and EEG improvement without clinical improvement in 14.2%. The modified SCNC with refined definitions including the ACNS terminology leads to clinically relevant and statistically significant reduction of false positive diagnoses of NCSE and to minimal loss in sensitivity.

Rapid and correct diagnosis of nonconvulsive status epilepticus (NCSE) is crucial for optimal treatment. However, electroencephalographic diagnosis can be challenging. Salzburg Consensus Criteria (SCC) have been proposed to facilitate correct diagnosis, but their validity needs to be further established. We retrospectively reanalyzed the first EEG in adult patients (n = 284) referred under the suspicion of NCSE at our institution in 2014. Nonconvulsive status epilepticus or possible NCSE was diagnosed according to the SCC by an examiner specifically trained in SCC and was compared with the original diagnosis made by an expert EEG examiner, which in this context served as the reference standard, to assess the validity of the criteria. Furthermore, the clinical outcome for patients not diagnosed using SCC (false-negatives) was examined. Nonconvulsive status epilepticus or possible NCSE was diagnosed in 40 patients by the inexperienced reader using the SCC, blinded to other clinical data, and in 47 patients by the experienced reader, not blinded to the clinical data, who did not use SCC. There were eight false-negatives, one false-positive, 39 true-positives, and 236 true-negatives. Concordance between SCC and the reference standard was high (k = 0.88 [95% confidence interval, 0.80 to 0.96]). Four of the eight false-negatives suffered from anoxic encephalopathy. The remainder had a history of epilepsy and returned to preictal functional state. The SCC for NCSE implemented by an inexperienced EEG reader, blinded to all other data, yielded results highly concordant with the evaluation of EEG by an experienced reader. False-negative diagnoses were associated with postictal states or anoxic encephalopathy.

Nonconvulsive status epilepticus (NCSE) is common in patients with coma with a prevalence between 5% and 48%. Patients in deep coma may exhibit epileptiform EEG patterns, such as generalized periodic spikes, and there is an ongoing debate about the relationship of these patterns and NCSE. The purposes of this review are (i) to discuss the various EEG patterns found in coma, its fluctuations, and transitions and (ii) to propose modified criteria for NCSE in coma. Classical coma patterns such as diffuse polymorphic delta activity, spindle coma, alpha/theta coma, low output voltage, or burst suppression do not reflect NCSE. Any ictal patterns with a typical spatiotemporal evolution or epileptiform discharges faster than 2.5 Hz in a comatose patient reflect nonconvulsive seizures or NCSE and should be treated. Generalized periodic diacharges or lateralized periodic discharges (GPDs/LPDs) with a frequency of less than 2.5 Hz or rhythmic discharges (RDs) faster than 0.5 Hz are the borderland of NCSE in coma. In these cases, at least one of the additional criteria is needed to diagnose NCSE (a) subtle clinical ictal phenomena, (b) typical spatiotemporal evolution, or (c) response to antiepileptic drug treatment. There is currently no consensus about how long these patterns must be present to qualify for NCSE, and the distinction from nonconvulsive seizures in patients with critical illness or in comatose patients seems arbitrary. The Salzburg Consensus Criteria for NCSE [1] have been modified according to the Standardized Terminology of the American Clinical Neurophysiology Society [2] and validated in three different cohorts, with a sensitivity of 97.2%, a specificity of 95.9%, and a diagnostic accuracy of 96.3% in patients with clinical signs of NCSE. Their diagnostic utility in different cohorts with patients in deep coma has to be studied in the future. This article is part of a Special Issue entitled "Status Epilepticus".

The diagnosis of nonconvulsive status epilepticus (NCSE) can pose a challenge. Electroencephalogram (EEG) patterns can be difficult to interpret, and the absence of an EEG correlate does not rule out the diagnosis of NCSE. In this setting, neuroimaging tools to help in the diagnosis are crucial. Our aim was to evaluate the role of 99mTc-hexamethyl propyleneamine oxime (HMPAO) single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) and quantitative HMPAO-SPECT (QtSPECT) in patients with clinical suspicion of NCSE, and to evaluate their value in the final diagnosis of NCSE. We recruited consecutive patients admitted in our center with suspicion of NCSE, and selected those who underwent an HMPAO-SPECT. All patients were admitted to the neurology ward and underwent an EEG. We divided the patients into those who were finally with diagnosed NCSE (NCSE-p) and those who were not (non-NCSE) according to the Salzburg Diagnostic EEG criteria. Sensitivity and specificity of the diagnostic tools were calculated. The SPECTs were acquired in a Skylight SPECT (Philips Healthcare, Amsterdam). The injections were done during the clinical episode suspected of being an NCSE. The HMPAO-SPECT was analyzed by two experts and was also quantified. All data were normalized to the SPM SPECT template. We used an external healthy normal database to obtain a Z-score map for each individual versus the normal database. The Z-score maximum (Z<sub>max</sub>) was extracted from each region of the AAL atlas as was the percentage of voxels with a Z-score higher than 2.5 (N(%)). A logistic regression combining the Z<sub>max</sub>, N(%), and the effect of patient age was fitted to predict the final NCSE diagnosis. A receiver operator characteristic (ROC) curve and the area under the curve (AUC) were obtained to evaluate the classification performance. We included 55 patients, 21 of them women (38.9%), with a median age of 62.1 years old (range 25-84). Thirty-six patients were with diagnosed NCSE (62.9%). Initial EEG had a sensitivity of 61.1% and a specificity of 89%. Most of the patients were critically ill with diagnostic difficulties, and it could be one of the main reasons to find low sensitivity of the Salzburg diagnostic EEG criteria. The Z<sub>max</sub> and N(%) were significantly higher in NCSE-p than in non-NCSE (p = 0.005 and p < 0.001, respectively). The HMPAO-SPECT qualitative analysis had a sensitivity of 80.5% and specificity of 89.5% while QtSPECT had a sensitivity of 82% and specificity of 81%. Both 99mTc-HMPAO-SPECT and QtSPECT can be useful in the diagnosis of NCSE.

To improve the diagnostic accuracy of electroencephalography (EEG) criteria for nonconvulsive status epilepticus (NCSE), external validation of the recently proposed Salzburg criteria is paramount. We performed an external, retrospective, diagnostic accuracy study of the Salzburg criteria, using EEG recordings from patients with and without a clinical suspicion of having NCSE. Of the 191 EEG recordings, 12 (12%) was classified as an NCSE according to the reference standard. In the validation cohort, sensitivity was 67% and specificity was 89%. The positive predictive value was 47% and the negative predictive value was 95%. Ten patients in the control group (n = 93) were false positive, resulting in a specificity of 89.2%. The interrater agreement between the reference standards and between the scorers of the Salzburg criteria was moderate; disagreement occurred mainly in patients with an epileptic encephalopathy. The Salzburg criteria showed a lower diagnostic accuracy in our external validation study than in the original design, suggesting that they cannot replace the current practice of careful weighing of both clinical and EEG information on an individual basis.

to investigate the semiology of subtle motor phenomena in critically ill patients, with- versus without nonconvulsive status epilepticus (NCSE). 60 consecutive comatose patients, in whom subtle motor phenomena were observed in the intensive care unit (ICU), were analysed prospectively. The semiology of the subtle phenomena was described from video-recordings, blinded to all other data. For each patient, the type, location and occurrence-pattern/duration were described. EEGs recorded in the ICU were classified using the Salzburg criteria for NCSE. only 23% (14/60) of the patients had NCSE confirmed by EEG. None of the semiological features could distinguish between patients with NCSE and those without. In both groups, the following phenomena were most common: discrete myoclonic muscle twitching and discrete tonic muscle activation. Besides these, automatisms and eye deviation were observed in both groups. subtle motor phenomena in critically ill patients can raise the suspicion of NCSE. Nevertheless, EEG is needed to confirm the diagnosis, since none of the semiological features are specific.

We aimed to assess the usefulness of the Salzburg Consensus Criteria (SCC) for determining the prognosis of critically ill patients with nonconvulsive status epilepticus (NCSE). We retrospectively reviewed consecutive patients with unconsciousness followed up in the intensive care unit (ICU). Three clinical neurophysiologists, one of them blinded to clinical and laboratory data, reevaluated all EEG data independently and determined NCSE according to SCC. The incidence of NCSE and ictal EEG patterns and their relationship to clinical, laboratory, neuroradiological, and prognostic findings were assessed. A total of 107 consecutive patients with mean age 68.2 ± 15.3 years (57 females) were enrolled in the study. Primary neuronal injury was detected in 59 patients (55.7%). Thirty-three patients (30.8%) were diagnosed as NCSE. While authors decided to treat 33 patients (30.8%), 32 patients (29.9%) had been treated in real-life evaluation. Clinical and EEG improvement were detected in 12 patients (11.3%) in real-life treatment group showing correlation with lack of intubation and ICU stay related to postsurgical event. Rate of mortality (45.8%) was high showing association with systemic-metabolic etiology, severity of coma and presence of "plus" modifiers in the EEG. Our findings suggest that SCC is highly compatible with clinical practice in the decision for treatment of patients with NCSE. The presence of "plus" modifiers in the EEG was found to be associated with mortality in these patients and was a significant marker for the high mortality rate.

To investigate clinical characteristics and outcomes of nonconvulsive status epilepticus (NCSE) after convulsive status epilepticus (CSE) and determine risk factors for unfavorable outcomes. We reviewed consecutive patients with NCSE after CSE over eight years in the neurological intensive care unit. Clinical presentations and the Salzburg EEG criteria for NCSE were used to identify patients with NCSE after CSE. Demographics, clinical features, and anti-epileptic treatment responses were collected and analyzed. Modified Rankin Scale (mRS) was used to evaluate three-month outcomes. A multivariate logistic regression model was used to determine independent prognostic factors. Among 145 consecutive patients with convulsive SE, 48 (33.1%) patents eventually evolved into NCSE. Two patients with cerebral anoxia were exclude. At three-month follow-up, 23 patients (50.0%) had mRS ≥ 3, and 16 (34.8%) died. Thirty-two patients (69.6%) were given continuous intravenous anesthetic drugs (CIVADs). Fourteen patients (30.4%) had CIVAD at the rate >50% proposed maximal dose (PMD). There was a single predictor factor found significant after multivariate logistic regression analysis: the recurrence of EEG seizures within two hours of initiation of CIVAD at a dose of greater than half the proposed maximal dose (OR, 9.63; 95%CI, 1.08-86.18; p = 0.043). The use of CIVAD, even with a high dose (>50% PMD), was not independently associated with unfavorable outcomes. The recurrence of EEG seizures within two hours of initiation of CIVAD at a dose of greater than half the proposed maximal dose predicts unfavorable outcomes in NCSE after CSE. The refractoriness of the seizures might be a significantly greater risk for poor outcome in NCSE after CSE than treatment with CIVADs.
