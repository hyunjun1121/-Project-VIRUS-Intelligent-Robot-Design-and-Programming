The successful use of proteasome inhibitors in clinical trials revealed the potential of the Ubiquitin Proteasome System for drug development. Protein remodeling through ubiquitylation is known to regulate the stability and activity of essential cellular factors through largely uncharacterized mechanisms. Here, we used Tandem repeated Ubiquitin Binding Entities (TUBEs) under non-denaturing conditions followed by mass spectrometry analysis to study global ubiquitylation events that may lead to the identification of potential drug targets. Using this approach we identified 643 proteins including known and unknown ubiquitin targets from human breast adenocarcinoma MCF7 cells treated with Adriamycin. Coherent with a global cellular response to this genotoxic insult, cellular factors identified are involved in protein synthesis, cellular transport, RNA post-transcriptional modification and signaling pathways regulating early stress responses. This includes components of large macromolecular complexes such as subunits and regulators of the proteasome, supporting the use of this method to characterize networks of molecular interactions coordinated by ubiquitylation. Further in vitro and in silico analysis confirmed that 84% of the total proteins identified here, are ubiquitylated. More importantly the enrichment of known biomarkers and targets for drug development, underlined the potential of this approach for the identification of this clinically relevant information.

Protein ubiquitination plays an important role in the regulation of many cellular processes, including protein degradation, cell cycle regulation, apoptosis, and DNA repair. To study the ubiquitin proteome we have established an immunoaffinity purification method for the proteomic analysis of endogenously ubiquitinated protein complexes. A strong, specific enrichment of ubiquitinated factors was achieved using the FK2 antibody bound to protein G-beaded agarose, which recognizes monoubiquitinated and polyubiquitinated conjugates. Mass spectrometric analysis of two FK2 immunoprecipitations (IPs) resulted in the identification of 296 FK2-specific proteins in both experiments. The isolation of ubiquitinated and ubiquitination-related proteins was confirmed by pathway analyses (using Ingenuity Pathway Analysis and Gene Ontology-annotation enrichment). Additionally, comparing the proteins that specifically came down in the FK2 IP with databases of ubiquitinated proteins showed that a high percentage of proteins in our enriched fraction was indeed ubiquitinated. Finally, assessment of protein-protein interactions revealed that significantly more FK2-specific proteins were residing in protein complexes than in random protein sets. This method, which is capable of isolating both endogenously ubiquitinated proteins and their interacting proteins, can be widely used for unraveling ubiquitin-mediated protein regulation in various cell systems and tissues when comparing different cellular states.

Ubiquitination is a posttranslational modification of proteins that involves the covalent attachment of ubiquitin, either as a single moiety or as polymers. This process controls almost every cellular metabolic pathway through a variety of combinations of linkages. Mass spectrometry now allows high throughput approaches for the identification of the thousands of ubiquitinated proteins and of their ubiquitination sites. Despite major technological improvements in mass spectrometry in terms of sensitivity, resolution and acquisition speed, the use of efficient purification methods of ubiquitinated proteins prior to mass spectrometry analysis is critical to achieve an efficient characterization of the ubiquitome. This critical step is achieved using different approaches that possess advantages and pitfalls. Here, we discuss the limits that can be encountered when deciphering the ubiquitome.
