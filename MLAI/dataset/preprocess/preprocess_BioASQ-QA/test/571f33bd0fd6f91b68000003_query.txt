Which gene is responsible for the development of Sotos syndrome?

[PMID: 25510705]
To present prenatal diagnosis and molecular cytogenetic characterization of a de novo 5q35 microdeletion associated with Sotos syndrome. This was the first pregnancy of a 29-year-old woman. The pregnancy was uneventful until 27 weeks of gestation when left ventriculomegaly was first noted. At 31 weeks of gestation, polyhydramnios, macrocephaly, and ventriculomegaly were prominent on ultrasound, and left pyelectasis and bilateral ventriculomegaly were diagnosed on magnetic resonance imaging. The woman underwent amniocentesis and cordocentesis at 32 weeks of gestation. Conventional cytogenetic analysis was performed using cultured amniocytes and cord blood lymphocytes. Array comparative genomic hybridization (aCGH) was performed on uncultured amniocytes and parental blood. Metaphase fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) was performed on cultured lymphocytes. Conventional cytogenetics revealed a karyotype of 46,XX. aCGH on uncultured amniocytes revealed a de novo 1.07-Mb microdeletion at 5q35.2-q35.3 encompassing NSD1. Metaphase FISH analysis on the cord blood lymphocytes confirmed the deletion at 5q35.2. The postnatal phenotype was consistent with Sotos syndrome. Fetuses with Sotos syndrome may present macrocephaly, polyhydramnios, ventriculomegaly, and pyelectasis in the third trimester. aCGH and metaphase FISH are useful for rapid diagnosis of 5q35 microdeletion associated with Sotos syndrome.

Sotos syndrome (SoS) is a multiple anomaly, congenital disorder characterized by overgrowth, macrocephaly, distinctive facial features and variable degree of intellectual disability. Haploinsufficiency of the NSD1 gene at 5q35.3, arising from 5q35 microdeletions, point mutations, and partial gene deletions, accounts for a majority of patients with SoS. Recently, mutations and possible pathogenetic rare CNVs, both affecting a few candidate genes for overgrowth, have been reported in patients with Sotos-like overgrowth features. To estimate the frequency of NSD1 defects in the Brazilian SoS population and possibly reveal other genes implicated in the etiopathogenesis of this syndrome, we collected a cohort of 21 Brazilian patients, who fulfilled the diagnostic criteria for SoS, and analyzed the NSD1 and PTEN genes by means of multiplex ligation-dependent probe amplification and mutational screening analyses. We identified a classical NSD1 microdeletion, a novel missense mutation (p.C1593W), and 2 previously reported truncating mutations: p.R1984X and p.V1760Gfs*2. In addition, we identified a novel de novo PTEN gene mutation (p.D312Rfs*2) in a patient with a less severe presentation of SoS phenotype, which did not include pre- and postnatal overgrowth. For the first time, our study implies PTEN in the pathogenesis of SoS and further emphasizes the existence of ethno-geographical differences in NSD1 molecular alterations between patients with SoS from Europe/North America (70-93%) and those from South America (10-19%).

Haploinsufficiency of the NSD1 gene due to 5q35 microdeletions or intragenic mutations is the major cause of Sotos syndrome characterized by generalized overgrowth, large hands and feet with advanced bone age, craniofacial dysmorphic features, learning disability, and possible susceptibility to tumors. Here, we report on a 14-month-old boy with a reverse phenotype of Sotos syndrome due to the reciprocal duplication of the 5q35.3 region, including the NSD1 gene, detected by array CGH. The phenotype includes delayed bone age, microcephaly, seizures, and failure to thrive. Our case suggests that the gene dosage effect of the NSD1 gene is the likely cause for the reversed phenotype of Sotos syndrome in this patient.

Sotos syndrome is a well-known overgrowth syndrome characterized by excessive growth during childhood, macrocephaly, distinctive facial appearance and learning disability. This disorder is caused by mutations or deletions in NSD1 gene. The aim of this study is to examine the relationship between the neuroimaging and clinical features of children with Sotos syndrome. Six Turkish children with Sotos syndrome were followed up about 3-7 years. The diagnosis was confirmed with molecular genetic analysis. We identified the pathogenic NSD1 mutation including three novel in all patients. All the patients had a characteristic facial gestalt of Sotos syndrome consisting of triangular face with prominent forehead, frontoparietal sparseness of hair and small nose. However, the degree of psychomotor and intellectual development was variable. Severe learning defect and speech delay were remarkable in two patients. The neuroimaging analysis showed abnormalities in four of six patients including bilateral large ventricles, thinning of the corpus callosum and persistent cavum septum pellucidum et vergae. Typical craniofacial appearance is the primary finding for the diagnosis of the disease even in the infantile period. However, the degree of psychomotor and intellectual development is very variable and does not correlate with the neuroimaging findings.

Sotos syndrome is an overgrowth syndrome with characteristic facial dysmorphism, variable severity of learning disabilities and macrocephaly with overgrowth. Haploinsufficiency of the nuclear receptor SET domain-containing protein 1 (NSD1) gene located on 5q35 has been implicated as the cause of Sotos syndrome. This study was performed to investigate the mutation spectrum of NSD1 abnormalities and meaningful genotype-phenotype correlations in Korean patients with Sotos syndrome. Eighteen unrelated Korean patients with Sotos syndrome were enrolled for clinical and molecular analyses. Cytogenetic studies were performed to confirm 5q35 microdeletion, and NSD1 sequencing analysis was performed to identify intragenic mutations. NSD1 abnormalities were identified in 15 (83%) patients. Among them, eight patients (53%) had 5q35 microdeletions and the other seven patients (47%) had seven different NSD1 intragenic mutations including four novel mutations. The mutation spectrum of Korean patients with Sotos syndrome was similar to that of previous studies for Japanese patients. Height was significantly shorter and age of walking alone was significantly older in the microdeletion group compared with those in the intragenic mutation group. No significant differences were observed for other clinical characteristics between the microdeletion and intragenic mutation groups. Further studies with a larger number of patients will be necessary to draw conclusive genotype-phenotype correlations.

Recently, deletions encompassing the nuclear receptor binding SET-Domain 1 (NSD1) gene have been described as the major cause of Japanese patients with the Sotos syndrome, whereas point mutations have been identified in the majority of European Sotos syndrome patients. In order to investigate a possible phenotype-genotype correlation and to further define the predictive value of NSD1 mutations, we performed mutational analysis of the NSD1 gene in 20 patients and one familial case with Sotos syndrome, five patients with Weaver syndrome, six patients with unclassified overgrowth/mental retardation, and six patients with macrocephaly/mental retardation. We were able to identify mutations within the NSD1 gene in 18 patients and the familial case with Sotos syndrome (90%). The mutations (six nonsense, eight frame shifts, three splice site, one missense, one in-frame deletion) are expected to result in an impairment of NSD1 function. The best correlation between clinical assessment and molecular results was obtained for the Sotos facial gestalt in conjunction with overgrowth, macrocephaly, and developmental delay. In contrast to the high mutation detection rate in Sotos syndrome, none of the patients with Weaver syndrome, unclassified overgrowth/mental retardation and macrocephaly/mental retardation, harbored NSD1 mutations. We tested for large deletions by FISH analysis but were not able to identify any deletion cases. The results indicate that the great majority of patients with Sotos syndrome are caused by mutations in NSD1. Deletions covering the NSD1 locus were not found in the patients analyzed here.

Sotos syndrome is a multiple anomaly syndrome characterized by pre- and postnatal overgrowth with advanced bone age, macrocephaly, developmental delay, and distinctive facial phenotype. Autosomal dominant mutations and deletions of the nuclear receptor set domain gene (NSD1), which is located at chromosome 5q35, are responsible for most of the cases. We describe a six-year old boy who had tall stature, macrocephaly, typical facial appearance, learning disability, megaloencephaly, corpus callosum dysgenesis, and colpocephaly. Although he had normal bone age, the diagnosis of Sotos syndrome was suspected with these clinical findings, and fluorescence in situ hybridization analysis of the patient showed a heterozygous deletion covering the NSD1 region in the 5q35 locus. A brief overview of the syndrome is presented.

Sotos syndrome is a well-known overgrowth syndrome caused by haploinsufficiency of NSD1 gene located at 5q35. There are two types of mutations that cause NSD1 haploinsufficiency: mutations within the NSD1 gene (mutation type) and a 5q35 submicroscopic deletion encompassing the entire NSD1 gene (deletion type). We investigated detailed craniofacial, dental, and oral findings in five patients with deletion type, and three patients with mutation type Sotos syndrome. All eight patients had a high palate, excessive tooth wear, crowding, and all but one patient had hypodontia and deep bite. Hypodontia was exclusively observed in the second premolars, and there were no differences between the deletion and mutation types in the number of missing teeth. Another feature frequently seen in common with both types was maxillary recession. Findings seen more frequently and more pronounced in deletion-type than in mutation-type included mandibular recession, scissors or posterior cross bite, and small dental arch with labioclination of the maxillary central incisors. It is noteworthy that although either scissors bite or cross bite was present in all of the deletion-type patients, neither of these was observed in mutation-type patients. Other features seen in a few patients include enamel hypoplasia (two deletion patients), and ectopic tooth eruption (one deletion and one mutation patients). Our study suggests that Sotos syndrome patients should be observed closely for possible dental and oral complications especially for malocculusion in the deletion-type patients.

Sotos syndrome is an overgrowth syndrome with characteristic facial gestalt and mental retardation of variable severity. Haploinsufficiency of the NSD1 gene has been implicated as the major cause of Sotos syndrome, with a predominance of microdeletions reported in Japanese patients. This study was conducted to investigate into the spectrum of NSD1 gene mutations in southern Chinese patients with Sotos syndrome. Thirty-six Chinese patients with Sotos syndrome and two patients with Weaver syndrome were subject to molecular testing. NSD1 gene mutations were detected in 26 (72%) Sotos patients. Microdeletion was found in only 3 patients, while the other 23 had point mutations (6 frameshift, 8 nonsense, 2 spice site, and 7 missense). Of these, 19 mutations were never reported. NSD1 gene mutations were not found in the two patients with Weaver syndrome. Most cases of Sotos syndrome are caused by NSD1 gene defects, but the spectrum of mutations is different from that of Japanese patients. Genotype-phenotype correlation showed that patients with microdeletions might be more prone to congenital heart disease but less likely to have somatic overgrowth. The two patients with Weaver syndrome were not found to have NSD1 gene mutations, but the number was too small for any conclusion to be drawn.

Sotos syndrome is a rare genetic disorder characterized by overgrowth associated with macrocephaly and delayed psychomotor development. Patients with Sotos syndrome show 5q35 deletions involving NSD1 or its point mutations. We identified the common 5q35 deletion in a patient with atypical Sotos syndrome manifesting extremely severe developmental delay, joint hypermobility, and skin hyperextensibility, which are recognized as Marfanoid hypermobility syndrome. Further analyses were performed to identify the genetic cause of these additional findings. aCGH analysis revealed an additional 862 kb deletion of Xq22.3 in this patient, which was inherited from his healthy mother. The deleted region included five genes, including the nik-related kinase gene (NRK), which would be a candidate gene for the patient's Marfanoid hypermobility, because it is a member of the glucokinase subfamily that are involved in activating the JNK pathway, and is expressed in developing skeletal musculature. Severe developmental delay seen in the patient may be derived from position effect of the deletion for neighboring interleukin 1 receptor accessory protein-like 2 gene (IL1RAPL2), which is a candidate gene for X-linked mental retardation.

Mutations and deletions of the NSD1 gene, located on chromosome 5q35, are responsible for over 90% of cases of Sotos syndrome. Fluorescent in situ hybridization analysis (FISH), MLPA or multiplex quantitative PCR allow detection of total/partial NSD1 deletions and direct sequencing allows detection of NSD1 mutations. We describe two boys with Sotos syndrome in whom PCR amplification and direct sequencing of the NSD1 gene identified two novel mutations not previously described: c.4736dupG in exon 12 and c.3938_3939insT in exon 7. In addition to the cardinal and major features of the syndrome (abnormal facial appearance, overgrowth, cardiac anomalies, renal anomalies, hypotonia, neonatal jaundice, seizures and brain MRI abnormalities) in both patients, one boy also had cryptorchidism and vertebral anomalies, features considered not common. Despite the wide range of possible combinations of phenotypic features, molecular analysis can correctly identify Sotos syndrome.

Sotos syndrome is a genetic disorder characterized by a typical facial appearance, macrocephaly, accelerated growth, developmental delay, and a variable range of associated abnormalities. The NSD1 gene was recently found to be responsible for Sotos syndrome, and more than 150 patients with NSD1 alterations have been identified. A significant ethnic difference is found in the prevalence of different types of mutation, with a high percentage of microdeletions identified in Japanese Sotos syndrome patients and with intragenic mutations in most non-Japanese patients. NSD1 aberrations are rather specific for Sotos syndrome, but have also been detected in patients lacking one or more major criteria of the disorder, namely overgrowth, macrocephaly, and advanced bone age. Thus, new diagnostic criteria should be considered. Studies have reported different frequencies of mutations versus non-mutations in Sotos syndrome, thus indicating allelic or locus hetereogeneity. Although some authors have suggested genotype/phenotype correlations, further studies are needed.
