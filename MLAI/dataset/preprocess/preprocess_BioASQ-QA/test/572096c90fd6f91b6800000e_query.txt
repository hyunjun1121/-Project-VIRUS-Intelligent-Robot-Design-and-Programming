Which gene is involved in Giant Axonal Neuropathy?

[PMID: 23248352]
Giant axonal neuropathy is a rare autosomal recessive disorder, which typically involves both central and peripheral nervous system. Yet the phenotypic-genotypic correlation remains obscure. We report a novel compound heterozygous mutation with the c. 805C>T in exon 4(Arg545His missense mutation) and the c. 1634G>A in exon 11(Arg269Trp missense mutation) in an 11-year-old Chinese giant axonal neuropathy case. This patient had an atypical giant axonal neuropathy phenotype rather similar to Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease, without tightly curled hair and mental retardation. The patient had a slowly progressive sensory motor neuropathy since age 3 years, and she also had nystagmus, feet deformities, scoliosis, and cerebellar tonsillar protrusion. Electrophysiological studies indicated a predominantly axonal sensory-motor neuropathy. The diagnosis was confirmed by sural nerve biopsy and direct sequencing of all the 11 gigaxonin exons. The proband's parents are heterozygotes of the disease without symptoms. Our findings extend the number of gigaxonin mutations that cause giant axonal neuropathy.

Giant axonal neuropathy (GAN)(1) is a rare autosomal recessive neurological disorder caused by mutations in the GAN gene that encodes gigaxonin, a member of the BTB/Kelch family of E3 ligase adaptor proteins.(1) This disease is characterized by the aggregation of Intermediate Filaments (IF)-cytoskeletal elements that play important roles in cell physiology including the regulation of cell shape, motility, mechanics and intra-cellular signaling. Although a range of cell types are affected in GAN, neurons display the most severe pathology, with neuronal intermediate filament accumulation and aggregation; this in turn causes axonal swellings or "giant axons." A mechanistic understanding of GAN IF pathology has eluded researchers for many years. In a recent study(1) we demonstrate that the normal function of gigaxonin is to regulate the degradation of IF proteins via the proteasome. Our findings present the first direct link between GAN mutations and IF pathology; moreover, given the importance of IF aggregations in a wide range of disease conditions, our findings could have wider ramifications.

Giant axonal neuropathy (GAN) is an autosomal recessive neurologic disorder clinically characterized by a severe polyneuropathy, CNS abnormalities, and characteristic tightly curled hair. Recently, mutations in the gigaxonin gene have been identified as the underlying genetic defect. The authors report two novel mutations confirming that GAN is caused by mutations in the gigaxonin gene and raise the question whether some mutations may cause a mild subclinical neuropathy.

Painful peripheral neuropathy is a debilitating complication of the treatment of HIV with nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NRTIs). Patients are living longer with these drugs; however many develop excruciating, unremitting, and often treatment-limiting neuropathy that is resistant to conventional pain management therapies. Improving patient comfort and quality of life is paramount and depends on a clearer understanding of this devastating side effect. The mechanisms underlying the development of NRTI-induced neuropathy, however, remain unclear. Using a mouse model of NRTI-induced neuropathy, the authors conducted an unbiased whole-genome microarray screen to identify molecular targets in the spinal dorsal horn, which is the location where integration of ascending sensory transmission and descending modulatory effects occur. Analysis of the microarray data identified a change in the gene giant axonal neuropathy 1 (Gan1). Mutation of this gene has been linked to the development of giant axonal neuropathy (GAN), a rare autosomal recessive condition characterized by a progressive sensorimotor neuropathy. Gan1 has not been previously linked to nerve pathologies in other populations. In this study, downregulation of the Gan1 gene and the gene protein product, gigaxonin, was validated via quantitative polymerase chain reaction ([qPCR] gene expression) and Western blot analyses (protein level). Our report is the first to suggest that Gan1 might be a novel molecular target in the development of NRTI-induced peripheral neuropathy with implications for new therapeutic approaches to preventing or reducing a significant side effect of HIV treatment.

Giant axonal neuropathy is a rare severe autosomal recessive childhood disorder affecting both the peripheral nerves and the central nervous system. Peripheral nerves characteristically show giant axonal swellings filled with neurofilaments. The giant axonal neuropathy gene was localised by homozygosity mapping to chromosome 16q24.1 and identified as encoding a novel, ubiquitously expressed cytoskeletal protein named gigaxonin.We describe a consanguineous Algerian family with three affected sibs aged 16, 14 and 12 years who present a mild demyelinating sensory motor neuropathy, hypoacousia and kyphoscoliosis which was moderate in the two elder patients, severe in the third one, with no sign of central nervous system involvement and normal cerebral magnetic resonance imaging. This clinical picture is different from the classical severe form, with kinky hairs and early onset of central nervous system involvement and from the less severe form, with protracted course and late involvement of central nervous system. Nerve biopsy showed a moderate loss of myelinated fibers and several giant axons with thin or absent myelin, filled with neurofilaments. This neuropathological aspect is similar to the previously described families linked to the gigaxonin gene. Genetic study in this family showed absence of linkage to chromosome 16q24.1, indicating for the first time, a genetic heterogeneity in giant axonal neuropathy. We propose to call this form of giant axonal neuropathy giant axonal neuropathy 2, and to use the name of giant axonal neuropathy 1 for the form linked to 16q24.1.

Giant axonal neuropathy (GAN) is a rare pediatric neurodegenerative disease. It is best known for the "giant" axons caused by accumulations of intermediate filaments. The disease is progressive, with onset around age 3 years and death by the third decade of life. GAN results from recessive mutations in the GAN gene encoding gigaxonin, and our analysis of all reported mutations shows that they are distributed throughout the protein structure. Precisely how these mutations cause the disease remains to be determined. In addition to changes in peripheral nerves that are similar to those seen in neuropathies such as Charcot-Marie-Tooth type 2, GAN patients exhibit a wide range of central nervous system signs. These features, corroborated by degeneration of central tracts apparent from postmortem pathology, indicate that GAN is also a progressive neurodegenerative disease. To reflect this phenotype more precisely, we therefore propose that the disease should be more appropriately referred to as "giant axonal neurodegeneration."

Giant axonal neuropathy (GAN, MIM: 256850) is a devastating autosomal recessive disorder characterized by an early onset severe peripheral neuropathy, varying central nervous system involvement and strikingly frizzly hair. Giant axonal neuropathy is usually caused by mutations in the gigaxonin gene (GAN) but genetic heterogeneity has been demonstrated for a milder variant of this disease. Here, we report ten patients referred to us for molecular genetic diagnosis. All patients had typical clinical signs suggestive of giant axonal neuropathy. In seven affected individuals, we found disease causing mutations in the gigaxonin gene affecting both alleles: two splice-site and four missense mutations, not reported previously. Gigaxonin binds N-terminally to ubiquitin activating enzyme E1 and C-terminally to various microtubule associated proteins causing their ubiquitin mediated degradation. It was shown for a number of gigaxonin mutations that they impede this process leading to accumulation of microtubule associated proteins and there by impairing cellular functions.

Giant Axonal Neuropathy is a pediatric neurodegenerative disorder caused by autosomal recessive mutations in the GAN gene on chromosome 16q24.1. Mutations in the GAN gene lead to functional impairment of the cytoskeletal protein gigaxonin and a generalized disorder of intermediate filaments, including neurofilaments in axons. Tightly curled hair is a common but not universal feature of Giant Axonal Neuropathy. The pathogenesis of curly hair is unknown, although disruption of keratin architecture is thought to play a role. As part of a broader natural history study of Giant Axonal Neuropathy, we found that the absence of curly hair is correlated with superior motor function (p=0.013) when controlling for age, as measured by the Gross Motor Function Measure. Theoretically, higher levels of functional gigaxonin protein or compensatory mechanisms could produce fewer abnormalities of neurofilaments and keratin, accounting for this phenotype. We suggest that straight-haired patients with Giant Axonal Neuropathy are potentially underdiagnosed due to their divergence from the classic phenotype of the disease. Due to their non-specific features of an axonal neuropathy, these patients may be misdiagnosed with Charcot-Marie-Tooth Disease type 2. Genetic testing for Giant Axonal Neuropathy should be considered in relevant cases of Charcot-Marie-Tooth Disease type 2.

Giant axonal neuropathy is a severe autosomal recessive neurodegenerative disorder of childhood that affects both the peripheral and central nervous systems. It is caused by mutations in the GAN gene linked to chromosome 16q24.1 At least 45 distinct disease-causing mutations have been identified throughout the gene in families of various ethnic origins, with different symptomatologies and different clinical courses. To date, no characteristic mutation or phenotype-genotype correlation has been established. We describe a novel missense mutation in four siblings born to consanguineous parents of Arab original with clinical and molecular features compatible with giant axonal neuropathy. The phenotype was characterized by a predominant motor and sensory peripheral neuropathies and severe skeletal deformities.

The BTB-KELCH protein Gigaxonin plays key roles in sustaining neuron survival and cytoskeleton architecture. Indeed, recessive mutations in the Gigaxonin-encoding gene cause Giant Axonal Neuropathy (GAN), a severe neurodegenerative disorder characterized by a wide disorganization of the Intermediate Filament network. Growing evidences suggest that GAN is a continuum with the peripheral neuropathy Charcot-Marie-Tooth diseases type 2 (CMT2). Sharing similar sensory-motor alterations and aggregation of Neurofilaments, few reports have revealed that GAN and some CMT2 forms can be misdiagnosed on clinical and histopathological examination. The goal of this study is to propose a new differential diagnostic test for GAN/CMT2. Moreover, we aim at identifying the mechanisms causing the loss-of-function of Gigaxonin, which has been proposed to bind CUL3 and substrates as part of an E3 ligase complex. We establish that determining Gigaxonin level constitutes a very valuable diagnostic test in discriminating new GAN cases from clinically related inherited neuropathies. Indeed, in a set of seven new families presenting a neuropathy resembling GAN/CMT2, only five exhibiting a reduced Gigaxonin abundance have been subsequently genetically linked to GAN. Generating the homology modeling of Gigaxonin, we suggest that disease mutations would lead to a range of defects in Gigaxonin stability, impairing its homodimerization, BTB or KELCH domain folding, or CUL3 and substrate binding. We further demonstrate that regardless of the mutations or the severity of the disease, Gigaxonin abundance is severely reduced in all GAN patients due to both mRNA and protein instability mechanisms. In this study, we developed a new penetrant and specific test to diagnose GAN among a set of individuals exhibiting CMT2 of unknown etiology to suggest that the prevalence of GAN is probably under-evaluated among peripheral neuropathies. We propose to use this new test in concert with the clinical examination and prior to the systematic screening of GAN mutations that has shown strong limitations for large deletions. Combining the generation of the structural modeling of Gigaxonin to an analysis of Gigaxonin transcripts and proteins in patients, we provide the first evidences of the instability of this E3 ligase adaptor in disease.

Giant axonal neuropathy (GAN) is caused by loss of function of the gigaxonin protein. On a cellular level GAN is characterized by intermediate filament (IF) aggregation, leading to a progressive and fatal peripheral neuropathy in humans. This study sought to determine if re-introduction of the GAN gene into GAN-deficient cells and mice would restore proper cytoskeleton IF homeostasis. Treatment of primary skin fibroblast cultures from three different GAN patients with an adeno-associated virus type 2 (AAV2) vector containing a normal human GAN transgene significantly reduced the number of cells displaying vimentin IF aggregates. A proteomic analysis of these treated cells was also performed, wherein the abundance of 32 of 780 identified proteins significantly changed in response to gigaxonin gene transfer. While 29 of these responding proteins have not been directly described in association with gigaxonin, three were previously identified as being disregulated in GAN and were now shifted toward normal levels. To assess the potential application of this approach in vivo and eventually in humans, GAN mice received an intracisternal injection of an AAV9/GAN vector to globally deliver the GAN gene to the brainstem and spinal cord. The treated mice showed a nearly complete clearance of peripherin IF accumulations at 3 weeks post-injection. These studies demonstrate that gigaxonin gene transfer can reverse the cellular IF aggregate pathology associated with GAN.

Giant axonal neuropathy (GAN) is a progressive neurodegenerative disease caused by autosomal recessive mutations in the GAN gene resulting in a loss of a ubiquitously expressed protein, gigaxonin. Gene replacement therapy is a promising strategy for treatment of the disease; however, the effectiveness and safety of gigaxonin reintroduction have not been tested in human GAN nerve cells. Here we report the derivation of induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) from three GAN patients with different GAN mutations. Motor neurons differentiated from GAN iPSCs exhibit accumulation of neurofilament (NF-L) and peripherin (PRPH) protein and formation of PRPH aggregates, the key pathological phenotypes observed in patients. Introduction of gigaxonin either using a lentiviral vector or as a stable transgene resulted in normalization of NEFL and PRPH levels in GAN neurons and disappearance of PRPH aggregates. Importantly, overexpression of gigaxonin had no adverse effect on survival of GAN neurons, supporting the feasibility of gene replacement therapy. Our findings demonstrate that GAN iPSCs provide a novel model for studying human GAN neuropathologies and for the development and testing of new therapies in relevant cell types.

Different missense, nonsense and frameshift mutations in the GAN gene encoding gigaxonin have been described to cause giant axonal neuropathy, a severe early-onset progressive neurological disease with autosomal recessive inheritance. By oligonucleotide array CGH analysis, we identified a 57-131 kb microdeletion affecting this gene in a patient with developmental delay, ataxia, areflexia, macrocephaly, and strikingly frizzy hair. The microdeletion was inherited from the mother and mutation analysis revealed a paternally inherited missense mutation c.1456G>A in exon 9 on the other allele. Our findings illustrate the power of higher resolution array CGH studies and highlight the importance of considering copy number variations in autosomal recessive diseases.

The objective of the study was to investigate a girl with giant axonal neuropathy and detect the mutation of GAN gene in her family. The encoding exons of GAN gene were amplified from genomic DNA of the proband and her parents by polymerase chain reaction and directly sequenced after purification. The proband manifested typical neurological symptoms and pathological abnormalities. The case had 2 heterozygous missense mutations in GAN gene: 1. c. 224 T>A in exon 2, her mother was a heterozygote of this mutation and had normal phenotype; 2. c.1634G>A in exon 10, and her father was a heterozygote of this mutation and had normal phenotype. Both of the mutations caused amino acid changes in the gigaxonin protein. In this family, missense mutation of c.224 T>A and missense mutation of c.1634G>A in GAN gene caused the phenotype of giant axonal neuropathy in the proband. Her parents are heterozygotes of the disease without symptoms.

Evaluation of hereditary axonal neuropathy in childhood is complex. Often, the child has to be subjected to general anaesthesia for a nerve biopsy to guide further genetic testing, which may or may not be readily available. We describe a toddler with clinical features suggesting giant axonal neuropathy (GAN), whose diagnosis was confirmed by minimally invasive skin biopsy and corroborated by the finding of compound heterozygous mutations involving the GAN gene, including a novel interstitial microdeletion at 16q23.2 detected by microarray and a point mutation detected by direct sequencing.

Giant axonal neuropathy (GAN) is a rare autosomal recessive neurodegenerative disorder caused by mutations in the GAN gene. Herein we report ultrastructural changes in Chinese patients with GAN. General clinical assessment, sural nerve biopsy, and genetic analysis were performed. Sural biopsy revealed giant axons in 3 patients, 2 with a mild phenotype and 1 with a classical phenotype. Ultrastructurally, all patients had giant axons filled with closely packed neurofilaments. In addition, the classical patient had some axons containing irregular tubular-like structures. GAN mutation analysis revealed novel compound heterozygous c.98A>C and c.158C>T mutations in the BTB domain in 1 mild patient, a novel homozygous c.371T>G mutation in the BACK domain in another mild patient, and a novel c.1342G>T homozygous mutation in the Kelch domain in the classical patient. Closely packed neurofilaments in giant axons are common pathological changes in Chinese patients with GAN, whereas irregular tubular-like structures appear in the classical type of this neuropathy.
