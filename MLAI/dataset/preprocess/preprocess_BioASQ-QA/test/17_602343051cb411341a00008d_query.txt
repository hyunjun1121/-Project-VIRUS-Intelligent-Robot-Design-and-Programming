ApoC-III (apolipoprotein C-III) glycosylation can predict cardiovascular disease risk. Higher abundance of disialylated (apoC-III<sub>2</sub>) over monosialylated (apoC-III<sub>1</sub>) glycoforms is associated with lower plasma triglyceride levels. Yet, it remains unclear whether apoC-III glycosylation impacts TRL (triglyceride-rich lipoprotein) clearance and whether apoC-III antisense therapy (volanesorsen) affects distribution of apoC-III glycoforms. Approach and Results: To measure the abundance of human apoC-III glycoforms in plasma over time, human TRLs were injected into wild-type mice and mice lacking hepatic TRL clearance receptors, namely HSPGs (heparan sulfate proteoglycans) or both LDLR (low-density lipoprotein receptor) and LRP1 (LDLR-related protein 1). ApoC-III was more rapidly cleared in the absence of HSPG (t<sub>1/2</sub>=25.4 minutes) than in wild-type animals (t<sub>1/2</sub>=55.1 minutes). In contrast, deficiency of LDLR and LRP1 (t<sub>1/2</sub>=56.1 minutes) did not affect clearance of apoC-III. After injection, a significant increase in the relative abundance of apoC-III<sub>2</sub> was observed in HSPG-deficient mice, whereas the opposite was observed in mice lacking LDLR and LRP1. In patients, abundance of plasma apoC-III glycoforms was assessed after placebo or volanesorsen administration. Volanesorsen treatment correlated with a statistically significant 1.4-fold increase in the relative abundance of apoC-III<sub>2</sub> and a 15% decrease in that of apoC-III<sub>1</sub>. The decrease in relative apoC-III<sub>1</sub> abundance was strongly correlated with decreased plasma triglyceride levels in patients. Our results indicate that HSPGs preferentially clear apoC-III<sub>2</sub>. In contrast, apoC-III<sub>1</sub> is more effectively cleared by LDLR/LRP1. Clinically, the increase in the apoC-III<sub>2</sub>/apoC-III<sub>1</sub> ratio on antisense lowering of apoC-III might reflect faster clearance of apoC-III<sub>1</sub> because this metabolic shift associates with improved triglyceride levels.

Volanesorsen, an investigational inhibitor of apoC-III synthesis, significantly reduced triglyceride levels in clinical trials in patients with familial chylomicronemia syndrome (FCS), a rare genetic disorder characterized by marked chylomicronemia leading to a spectrum of symptoms, including recurrent abdominal pain and episodes of potentially fatal acute pancreatitis (AP). To determine the effect of volanesorsen on burden of disease on patients with FCS Methods: ReFOCUS was a retrospective global web-based survey open to patients with FCS who received volanesorsen for ≥3 months in an open-label extension study. The survey included questions about patients' experiences before and after volanesorsen treatment. Twenty-two respondents had received volanesorsen for a median of 222 days. Volanesorsen significantly reduced the number of symptoms per patient across physical, emotional, and cognitive domains. Significant reductions from baseline were reported for steatorrhea, pancreatic pain, and constant worry about an attack of pain/AP. Respondents reported that volanesorsen improved overall management of symptoms and reduced interference of FCS with work/school responsibilities. Reductions in the negative impact of FCS on personal, social, and professional life were also reported. Treatment with volanesorsen has the potential to reduce disease burden in patients with FCS through modulation of multiple symptom domains.

Severe hypertriglyceridaemia is associated with pancreatitis and chronic pancreatitis-induced diabetes. Familial chylomicronaemia syndrome (FCS) is a rare autosomal recessive disorder of lipid metabolism characterised by high levels of triglycerides (TGs) due to failure of chylomicron clearance. It causes repeated episodes of severe abdominal pain, fatigue and attacks of acute pancreatitis. There are few current options for its long-term management. The only universal long-term therapy is restriction of total dietary fat intake to <10-15% of daily calories (15 to 20g per day). Many patients have been treated with fibrates and statins with a variable response, but many remain susceptible to pancreatitis. Other genetic syndromes associated with hypertriglyceridaemia include familial partial lipodystrophy (FPLD). Targeting apolipoprotein C3 (apoC3) offers the ability to increase clearance of chylomicrons and other triglyceride-rich lipoproteins. Volanesorsen is an antisense oligonucleotide (ASO) inhibitor of apoC3, which reduces TG levels by 70-80% which has been shown also to reduce rates of pancreatitis and improve well-being in FCS and reduce TGs and improve insulin resistance in FPLD. It is now undergoing licensing and payer reviews. Further developments of antisense technology including small interfering RNA therapy to apoC3 as well as other approaches to modulating triglycerides are in development for this rare disorder.

To determine the effects of volanesorsen (ISIS 304801), a second-generation 2'-O-methoxyethyl chimeric antisense inhibitor of apolipoprotein (apo)C-III, on triglyceride (TG) levels and insulin resistance in patients with type 2 diabetes. A randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial was performed in 15 adult patients with type 2 diabetes (HbA1c >7.5% [58 mmol/mol]) and hypertriglyceridemia (TG >200 and <500 mg/dL). Patients were randomized 2:1 to receive volanesorsen 300 mg or placebo for a total of 15 subcutaneous weekly doses. Glucose handling and insulin sensitivity were measured before and after treatment using a two-step hyperinsulinemic-euglycemic clamp procedure. Treatment with volanesorsen significantly reduced plasma apoC-III (-88%, P = 0.02) and TG (-69%, P = 0.02) levels and raised HDL cholesterol (HDL-C) (42%, P = 0.03) compared with placebo. These changes were accompanied by a 57% improvement in whole-body insulin sensitivity (P < 0.001). Importantly, we found a strong relationship between enhanced insulin sensitivity and both plasma apoC-III (r = -0.61, P = 0.03) and TG (r = -0.68, P = 0.01) suppression. Improved insulin sensitivity was sufficient to significantly lower glycated albumin (-1.7%, P = 0.034) and fructosamine (-38.7 μmol/L, P = 0.045) at the end of dosing and HbA1c (-0.44% [-4.9 mmol/mol], P = 0.025) 3 months postdosing. Volanesorsen reduced plasma apoC-III and TG while raising HDL-C levels. Importantly, glucose disposal, insulin sensitivity, and integrative markers of diabetes also improved in these patients after short-term treatment.

The aim of this study was to assess the effect of volanesorsen on the corrected QT (QTc) interval. This thorough QT study enrolled 52 healthy male and female subjects who were randomized at a single site in a four-way crossover study. Subjects were randomly assigned to 1 of 12 treatment sequences and crossed over into four treatment periods over the course of which each subject was to receive a single therapeutic dose of volanesorsen as a 300 mg subcutaneous (SC) injection, a single supratherapeutic dose of volanesorsen as 300 mg intravenous (IV) infusion, a single oral (PO) dose of moxifloxacin (positive control), and placebo dose. The study demonstrated that volanesorsen 300 mg SC and 300 mg IV did not have a clinically relevant effect on ΔΔQTcF exceeding 10 ms. The largest mean effect at any postdose time point was 3.0 ms (90% confidence interval [CI]: 0.8-5.2) after SC dosing and 1.8 ms (90% CI -0.4 to 4.0) after IV dosing. Volanesorsen, at the studied therapeutic and supratherapeutic doses, does not have a clinically meaningful effect on the QTc.

Elevated triglyceride levels (higher than ~1000 mg/dL) are associated with an increased risk for pancreatitis. Apolipoprotein-CIII (apoC-III) plays a key role in the metabolism of triglycerides and triglyceride-rich lipoproteins. Loss of function mutations in the gene encoding apoC-III (APOC3) is associated with low triglyceride levels and a decreased risk for cardiovascular disease (CVD) while overexpression of APOC3 is associated with hypertriglyceridemia. Although many drugs such as fibrates, statins and omega-3 fatty acids modestly decrease triglyceride levels (and apoC-III concentrations), there are many patients who still have severe hypertriglyceridemia and are at increased risk for pancreatitis and potentially for CVD. The antisense oligonucleotide (ASO) against APOC3 mRNA volanesorsen (previously called ISIS 304801, ISIS-ApoCIIIRx and IONIS-ApoCIIIRx) robustly decreases both, apoC-III production and triglyceride concentrations and is being currently evaluated in phase 3 trials. In this narrative review, we present the currently available clinical evidence on the efficacy and safety of volanesorsen for the treatment of hypertriglyceridemia.

Familial chylomicronemia syndrome is a rare genetic disorder that is caused by loss of lipoprotein lipase activity and characterized by chylomicronemia and recurrent episodes of pancreatitis. There are no effective therapies. In an open-label study of three patients with this syndrome, antisense-mediated inhibition of hepatic <i>APOC3</i> mRNA with volanesorsen led to decreased plasma apolipoprotein C-III and triglyceride levels. We conducted a phase 3, double-blind, randomized 52-week trial to evaluate the safety and effectiveness of volanesorsen in 66 patients with familial chylomicronemia syndrome. Patients were randomly assigned, in a 1:1 ratio, to receive volanesorsen or placebo. The primary end point was the percentage change in fasting triglyceride levels from baseline to 3 months. Patients receiving volanesorsen had a decrease in mean plasma apolipoprotein C-III levels from baseline of 25.7 mg per deciliter, corresponding to an 84% decrease at 3 months, whereas patients receiving placebo had an increase in mean plasma apolipoprotein C-III levels from baseline of 1.9 mg per deciliter, corresponding to a 6.1% increase (P<0.001). Patients receiving volanesorsen had a 77% decrease in mean triglyceride levels, corresponding to a mean decrease of 1712 mg per deciliter (19.3 mmol per liter) (95% confidence interval [CI], 1330 to 2094 mg per deciliter [15.0 to 23.6 mmol per liter]), whereas patients receiving placebo had an 18% increase in mean triglyceride levels, corresponding to an increase of 92.0 mg per deciliter (1.0 mmol per liter) (95% CI, -301.0 to 486 mg per deciliter [-3.4 to 5.5 mmol per liter]) (P<0.001). At 3 months, 77% of the patients in the volanesorsen group, as compared with 10% of patients in the placebo group, had triglyceride levels of less than 750 mg per deciliter (8.5 mmol per liter). A total of 20 of 33 patients who received volanesorsen had injection-site reactions, whereas none of the patients who received placebo had such reactions. No patients in the placebo group had platelet counts below 100,000 per microliter, whereas 15 of 33 patients in the volanesorsen group had such levels, including 2 who had levels below 25,000 per microliter. No patient had platelet counts below 50,000 per microliter after enhanced platelet-monitoring began. Volanesorsen lowered triglyceride levels to less than 750 mg per deciliter in 77% of patients with familial chylomicronemia syndrome. Thrombocytopenia and injection-site reactions were common adverse events. (Funded by Ionis Pharmaceuticals and Akcea Therapeutics; APPROACH Clinical Trials.gov number, NCT02211209.).

Severe hypertriglyceridemia (sHTG) is a complex disorder of lipid metabolism characterized by plasma levels of triglyceride (TG) greater than 885 mg/dl (>10 mmol/L). The treatment of sHTG syndromes is challenging because conventional treatments are often ineffective in reducing TG under the threshold to prevent acute pancreatitis (AP). The inhibition of <i>APOC3</i>, which encodes a protein involved in triglyceride (TG)-rich lipoproteins (TGRLs) removal, has been reported to be a novel target for the treatment of sHTG. Volanesorsen is a second-generation antisense oligonucleotide inhibiting apoC-III transcription/translation that has been recently approved in Europe for Familial Chylomicronemia Syndrome (FCS) treatment. This review summarizes the evidences on the efficacy and safety of volanesorsen for the treatment of sHTG syndromes. Volanesorsen effectively reduces TG in sHTG through a mechanism that is mainly LPL-independent, potentially decreasing the risk of AP. Some safety concerns have been raised with the use of volanesorsen, mainly represented by the occurrence of thrombocytopenia. Due to the potential severity of side effects, some caution is needed before affirming the long-term utility of this drug. Despite this, volanesorsen currently remains the only drug that has been demonstrated effective in FCS, which otherwise remains an untreatable disease.

Although elevated serum low-density lipoprotein-cholesterol (LDL-C) is without any doubts accepted as an important risk factor for cardiovascular disease (CVD), the role of elevated triglycerides (TGs)-rich lipoproteins as an independent risk factor has until recently been quite controversial. Recent data strongly suggest that elevated TG-rich lipoproteins are an independent risk factor for CVD and that therapeutic targeting of them could possibly provide further benefit in reducing CVD morbidity, events and mortality, apart from LDL-C lowering. Today elevated TGs are treated with lifestyle interventions, and with fibrates which could be combined with omega-3 fatty acids. There are also some new drugs. Volanesorsen, is an antisense oligonucleotid that inhibits the production of the Apo C-III which is crucial in regulating TGs metabolism because it inhibits lipoprotein lipase (LPL) and hepatic lipase activity but also hepatic uptake of TGs-rich particles. Evinacumab is a monoclonal antibody against angiopoietin-like protein 3 (ANGPTL3) and it seems that it can substantially lower elevated TGs levels because ANGPTL3 also regulates TGs metabolism. Pemafibrate is a selective peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor alpha modulator which also decreases TGs, and improves other lipid parameters. It seems that it also has some other possible antiatherogenic effects. Alipogene tiparvovec is a nonreplicating adeno-associated viral vector that delivers copies of the LPL gene to muscle tissue which accelerates the clearance of TG-rich lipoproteins thus decreasing extremely high TGs levels. Pradigastat is a novel diacylglycerol acyltransferase 1 inhibitor which substantially reduces extremely high TGs levels and appears to be promising in treatment of the rare familial chylomicronemia syndrome.

The prevalence of hypertriglyceridemia (HTG) is increasing. Elevated triglyceride (TG) levels are associated with an increased cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk. Moreover, severe HTG results in an elevated risk of pancreatitis, especially in severe HTG with an up to 350-fold increased risk. Both problems emphasize the clinical need for effective TG lowering. The purpose of this review is to discuss the currently available therapies and to elaborate the most promising novel therapeutics for TG lowering. Conventional lipid lowering strategies do not efficiently lower plasma TG levels, leaving a residual CVD and pancreatitis risk. Both apolipoprotein C-III (apoC-III) and angiopoietin-like 3 (ANGPTL3) are important regulators in TG-rich lipoprotein (TRL) metabolism. Several novel agents targeting these linchpins have ended phase II/III trials. Volanesorsen targeting apoC-III has shown reductions in plasma TG levels up to 90%. Multiple ANGPLT3 inhibitors (evinacumab, IONIS-ANGPTL3-L<sub>Rx</sub>, ARO-ANG3) effectuate TG reductions up to 70% with concomitant potent reduction in all other apoB containing lipoprotein fractions. We expect these therapeutics to become players in the treatment for (especially) severe HTG in the near future.

An elevated serum level of LDL cholesterol is a well-known risk factor for cardiovascular disease (CVD), but the role of elevated triglyceride levels is debated. Controversies regarding hypertriglyceridaemia as an independent risk factor for CVD have occurred partly because elevated triglyceride levels are often a component of atherogenic dyslipidaemia - they are associated with decreased levels of HDL cholesterol and increased levels of small dense LDL particles, which are highly atherogenic. Findings from several large studies indicate that elevated levels of triglycerides (either fasting or nonfasting) or, more specifically, triglyceride-rich lipoproteins and their remnants, are independently associated with increased risk of CVD. Possible mechanisms for this association include excessive free fatty acid release, production of proinflammatory cytokines, coagulation factors, and impairment of fibrinolysis. Therapeutic targeting of hypertriglyceridaemia could, therefore, reduce CVD and cardiovascular events, beyond the reduction achieved by LDL-cholesterol lowering. Elevated triglyceride levels are reduced with lifestyle interventions and fibrates, which can be combined with omega-3 fatty acids. Some new drugs are on the horizon, such as volanesorsen (which targets apolipoprotein C-III), pemafibrate, and others. However, CVD outcome studies with triglyceride-lowering agents have produced inconsistent results, meaning that no convincing evidence is available that lowering triglycerides by any approach can reduce mortality.

High plasma triacylglyceride levels are known to be associated with increased risk of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease. Apolipoprotein C-III (apoC-III) is a key regulator of plasma triacylglyceride levels and is associated with hypertriglyceridemia via a number of pathways. There is consistent evidence for an association of cardiovascular events with blood apoC-III level, with support from human genetic studies of APOC3 variants. As such, apoC-III has been recognised as a potential therapeutic target for patients with severe hypertriglyceridaemia with one of the most promising apoC-III-targeting drugs, volanesorsen, having recently progressed through Phase III trials. To exploit a rare loss of function variant in APOC3 (rs138326449) to characterise the potential long-term treatment effects of apoC-III targeting interventions on the metabolome. In a recall-by-genotype study, 115 plasma samples were analysed by UHPLC-MS to acquire non-targeted metabolomics data. The study included samples from 57 adolescents and 33 adults. Overall, 12 985 metabolic features were tested for an association with APOC3 genotype. 161 uniquely annotated metabolites were found to be associated with rs138326449(APOC3). The highest proportion of associated metabolites belonged to the acyl-acyl glycerophospholipid and triacylglyceride metabolite classes. In addition to the anticipated (on-target) reduction of metabolites in the triacylglyceride and related classes, carriers of the rare variant exhibited previously unreported increases in levels of a number of metabolites from the acyl-alkyl glycerophospholipid class. Overall, our results suggest that therapies targeting apoC-III may potentially achieve a broad shift in lipid profile that favours better metabolic health.

Volanesorsen (Waylivra<sup>®</sup>), an antisense oligonucleotide inhibitor of apolipoprotein CIII (apoCIII) mRNA, is being developed by Ionis Pharmaceuticals through its subsidiary company, Akcea Therapeutics, to treat familial chylomicronemia syndrome (FCS), hypertriglyceridemia and familial partial lipodystrophy (FPL). In May 2019, volanesorsen was approved in the EU for the treatment of adult patients with FCS based on positive results from the multinational, phase III APPROACH and COMPASS studies. Other clinical trials are ongoing to assess its utility in hypertriglyceridemia, FPL and partial lipodystrophy. This article summarizes the milestones in the development of volanesorsen leading to this first approval as an adjunct to diet in adult patients with genetically confirmed FCS and at high risk for pancreatitis, in whom response to diet and triglyceride lowering therapy has been inadequate.

Apolipoprotein CIII (ApoCIII) is now recognized as a key regulator in severe hypertriglyceridemia, chylomicronemia, and conditions of triglyceride-rich lipoprotein (TRL) remnant excess due to its inhibition of lipoprotein lipase (LPL) and hepatic lipase, leading to decreased hepatic reuptake of TRLs, as well as enhanced synthesis and secretion of VLDL from the liver. ApoCIII gain-of-function mutations are associated with atherosclerosis and coronary heart disease (CHD), and contribute to the development of cardiometabolic syndrome, hypertriglyceridemia, and type 2 diabetes mellitus. Conversely, loss-of-function mutations in ApoCIII are associated with lower levels of plasma triglycerides (TG), attenuation of vascular inflammatory processes such as monocyte adhesion and endothelial dysfunction, and potentially, a reduction in the incidence and progression of atherosclerosis and cardioprotection. Evidence is now emerging that volanesorsen, a second-generation antisense oligonucleotide drug targeting ApoCIII messenger RNA resulting in decreases in TG in patients with familial chylomicronemia syndrome, severe hypertriglyceridemia, and metabolic dyslipidemia with type 2 diabetes giving support to the hypothesis that ApoCIII is a powerful inhibitor of LPL, and when reduced, endogenous clearance of TRLs can result in substantial reductions in TG levels. Discovery of the ApoCIII inhibitor volanesorsen opens a new era of lipid-lowering drugs for reduction in TG and potentially for reduction in LDL-C. Herein, this review will provide an update on the pathophysiology of ApoCIII-linked atherosclerosis and the development of the first drug to target ApoCIII, volanesorsen, as a promising lipid-lowering agent.

Diabetic dyslipidemia in type 2 diabetes (T2DM) is characterized by elevated levels of triglycerides (TG), decreased levels of high density lipoprotein-cholesterol (HDL-C), elevated levels of low density lipoprotein-cholesterol (LDLC), and the predominance of small and dense LDL particles (sdLDL). The mechanism underlying diabetic dyslipidemia remains unclear. Insulin resistance is believed to be an important determinant. Mechanisms underlying insulin resistance-induced diabetic dyslipidemia seem to be related to apolipoprotein CIII (ApoCIII), a known inhibitor of lipoprotein lipase. The concentration of very low density lipoprotein1 (VLDL<sub>1</sub>) with a higher TG content and abundant ApoCIII was found to be significantly elevated in patients with T2DM. Recently, volanesorsen as a promising ApoIII inhibitor was shown to improve the lipid profile in patients with diabetic dyslipidemia. Herein, this paper will review recent advance in pathophysiology of diabetic dyslipidemia and the role of ApoCIII in this condition, with focus on describing a novel drug volanesorsen as potential treatment strategy.

Familial chylomicronemia syndrome (FCS) is a rare autosomal recessive disorder typically caused by mutations in genes for lipoprotein lipase (LPL), apolipoprotein C-II (Apo-CII), apolipoprotein A-V (Apo-AV), lipase maturation factor 1 (LMF1) and glycosylphosphatidylinositol-anchored high-density lipoprotein-binding protein 1 (GPI-HBP1). FCS is associated with severe morbidity that includes recurrent pancreatitis and other problems. Effective treatment to reliably prevent complications has been unavailable, so there is a quest to identify novel interventions to achieve sustained triglyceride lowering and prevention of pancreatitis. Apolipoprotein C-III (Apo-CIII) interferes with triglyceride clearance by blocking LPL and alternative pathways. Volanesorsen is an experimental antisense oligonucleotide that inhibits translation of Apo-CIII mRNA, thereby substantially lowering plasma levels of Apo-CIII and triglycerides. It is being developed for treatment of patients with FCS and refractory hypertriglyceridemia. Data from a variety of clinical trials have been very encouraging, with documentation of excellent triglyceride-lowering efficacy, but there have been concerns about the risk of drug-related thrombocytopenia and bleeding that contributed to the recent decision by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) to not approve the drug for clinical use. Clinical trials testing the safety and efficacy of volanesorsen are ongoing, so there is hope that the drug ultimately will be approved and available for treatment of high-risk patients with FCS.
