IDEAL_ANSWER:
- Evidence suggests that a fifth of annotated Caenorhabditis elegans genes may be pseudogenes.  At least 4% of the annotated C. elegans genes can be recognized as pseudogenes simply from closer inspection of the sequence data. Thus out of 18000 transcripts, around 3500 are expected to be pseudogenes.
- Evidence suggesting that a fifth of annotated Caenorhabditis elegans genes may be pseudogenes The remaining explanation is that most of the annotated genes in the recently duplicated category are pseudogenes, a proportion corresponding to 20% of all of the annotated C. elegans genes  At least 4% of the annotated C. elegans genes can be recognized as pseudogenes simply from closer inspection of the sequence data
