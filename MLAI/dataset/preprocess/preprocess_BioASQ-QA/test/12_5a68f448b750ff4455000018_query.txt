Which bacteria causes erythrasma?

[PMID: 8469500]
Erythrasma is an uncommon vulvar infection, best diagnosed by its fluorescence under the Wood lamp. This report shows that despite a negative Wood lamp examination, the diagnosis can be made histologically. A 42-year-old woman was referred to our clinic with a persistent candidal infection. Evaluation included a Wood lamp examination, wet mount, and potassium hydroxide test of the affected skin, all of which were negative. A biopsy of the area demonstrated rods and filamentous organisms in the keratotic layer consistent with a Corynebacterium minutissimum infection. The patient was diagnosed as having erythrasma, and she responded to oral erythromycin. Persistent vulvar diseases may be caused by erythrasma despite a negative Wood lamp examination. The diagnosis can be made by biopsy of the lesion.

Erythrasma is a superficial infection caused by Corynebacterium minutissimum and affects the major skin folds and the interdigital regions of the feet. It is characterized by erythematous, brown, scaly patches and maceration, and exhibits coral-red fluorescence under Wood light. The aim of this study was to determine the frequency of erythrasma in patients with interdigital lesions. An open, prospective, longitudinal, observational study was performed in a hospital in Mexico City between March and December, 2006. All patients with interdigital lesions were examined with a Wood lamp and direct examination was performed with 20 % potassium hydroxide. Cultures were done in Sabouraud dextrose agar and brain heart infusion agar, and smears were analyzed. General characteristics and concomitant diseases were recorded. We examined 73 patients, of whom 24 (32.8 %) were diagnosed with erythrasma based on coral-red fluorescence under Wood light and identification of corynebacteria by Gram staining. The disease was more common in women (83.33 %) and the mean age of the patients was 43.5 years. The main clinical findings were scaling and maceration, and the fourth interdigital web was the most commonly affected. Corynebacterium could not be isolated in any of the cases. Mycology was positive in 15 cases (62.5 %) and the following microorganisms were isolated: Candida (16.6 %), dermatophytes (12.5 %), and Trichosporon (4.1 %). Interdigital erythrasma is a common condition and can be easily confused with interdigital tinea. It persists if not treated appropriately. Rapid diagnosis is easily obtained by examination with a Wood lamp, while culture is difficult and unnecessary for diagnosis. The coexistence of erythrasma with dermatophytes and Candida should be considered when the interdigital webs are affected.

Erythrasma is a superficial cutaneous infection caused by Corynebacterium minutissimum and is characterized by fluorescence under Wood's light (UV) because of the presence of porphyrins. These molecules are photosensitizing and we propose to assess efficacy of red light that activates porphyrins (photodynamic reaction) in treatment of this pathology. Assessment of effects of photodynamic action of red light for treatment of erythrasma without exogenous photosensitizing molecules. Thirteen patients with erythrasma were treated by one illumination (80 J/cm2) by red light (broad band, peak at 635 nm) without exogenous photosensitizing molecules. Disappearance or reduction of extent of lesions were observed 2 weeks later. If lesions were still present, a second irradiation was conducted with the same method. Preliminary results are presented. As a result of red light irradiation, we noticed a complete recovery for three patients and, in most other cases, reduction of extent of lesions (mean: -29% after one session). The treatment was well tolerated. We report first cases of photodynamic treatment of erythrasma. There are other reports of clinical applications of antimicrobial action of photodynamic therapy in dermatology (acne vulgaris, leishmaniasis, warts, etc.). But there are few applications without addition of exogenous photosensitizing agent. The originality and interest of our study is to use spontaneous presence of porphyrins in the lesions. This technique seems to be an interesting alternative, inexpensive and easy, for the treatment of this localized infection. But an optimal method is still to be determined to improve efficacy.

Interdigital foot infections are mostly caused initially by dermatophytes, yeasts and less frequently by bacteria. Erythrasma caused by Corynebacterium minutissimum can be confused with superficial mycoses. The aim of the study was to determine the prevalence of the etiologic agents of superficial mycoses and the frequency of Corynebacterium minutissimum in interdigital foot infections. All the samples obtained from the 121 patients with interdigital foot infections were examined directly with the use of 20% potassium hydroxide mounts and Gram stain under the microscope and cultured on Sabouraud's dextrose agar plates. In identification of superficial mycoses, the rate was found to be 14% with the cultural method and 14% with direct microscopic examination. Using a combination of direct microscopic examination and culture, a 33.8% ratio was achieved. In the culture of these samples, the most isolated factor was Trichophyton rubrum (33.7%). In 24 of the patients (19.8%) Corynebacterium minutissimum was detected by Gram staining, in 6 of these patients Trichophyton rubrum was found, Trichophyton mentagrophytes was found in 2 and Trichosporon spp. was found in 1. The examination of interdigital foot lesions in the laboratory, the coexistence of erythrasma with dermatophytes and yeast should be considered.

Erythrasma is a skin infection which is caused by Corynebacterium minutissimum. Interdigital erythrasma is the most common form. The aim of this study was to detect the frequency and risk factors of interdigital erythrasma in patients with clinically suspected tinea pedis. This study was conducted between June and December 2010 and included 122 patients who had interdigital foot lesions. All patients were examined using a Wood's lamp. The smears were stained using Gram's method. Direct examination was performed using 20% potassium hydroxide. Sabouraud dextrose agar and brain heart infusion agar were used for cultures. Moreover, the demographical characteristics of patients, concomitant diseases and clinical findings were also recorded. Cases that were found to be positive on Wood's lamp examination and/or Gram staining/culture were considered as erythrasma. The rate of erythrasma was found to be 46.7%. The mean age was 43.6 years, and the disease was more prevalent in men. The most common clinical finding was desquamation. Mycological examination was found as positive in 40.35% of the patients. No growth was observed in bacteriological cultures. It was found that using only Wood's lamp examination or Gram staining resulted in 11 (9%) and 19 positive patients (15.6%), respectively, whereas using both Wood's lamp examination and Gram staining concurrently resulted in 27 positive patients (22.1%). Interdigital erythrasma is a commonly seen condition and can clinically mimic tinea pedis. A Wood's lamp is a good diagnostic tool, but Gram staining, particularly in those with a negative Wood's lamp result, may be a useful method.

Corynebacterium minutissimum is the bacteria that leads to cutaneous eruptions of erythrasma and is the most common cause of interdigital foot infections. It is found mostly in occluded intertriginous areas such as the axillae, inframammary areas, interspaces of the toes, intergluteal and crural folds, and is more common in individuals with diabetes mellitus than other clinical patients. This organism can be isolated from a cutaneous site along with a concurrent dermatophyte or Candida albicans infection. The differential diagnosis of erythrasma includes psoriasis, dermatophytosis, candidiasis and intertrigo, and methods for differentiating include Wood's light examination and bacterial and mycological cultures. Erythromycin 250mg four times daily for 14 days is the treatment of choice and other antibacterials include tetracycline and chloramphenicol; however, the use of chloramphenicol is limited by bone marrow suppression potentially leading to neutropenia, agranulocytosis and aplastic anaemia. Further studies are needed but clarithromycin may be an additional drug for use in the future. Where there is therapeutic failure or intertriginous involvement, topical solutions such as clindamycin, Whitfield's ointment, sodium fusidate ointment and antibacterial soaps may be required for both treatment and prophylaxis. Limited studies on the efficacy of these medications exist, however, systemic erythromycin demonstrates cure rates as high as 100%. Compared with tetracyclines, systemic erythromycin has greater efficacy in patients with involvement of the axillae and groin, and similar efficacy for interdigital infections. Whitfield's ointment has equal efficacy to systemic erythromycin in the axillae and groin, but shows greater efficacy in the interdigital areas and is comparable with 2% sodium fusidate ointment for treatment of all areas. Adverse drug effects and potential drug interactions need to be considered. No cost-effectiveness data are available but there are limited data on cost-related treatment issues. A guideline is proposed for the detection, evaluation, treatment and prophylaxis of this cutaneous eruption.

Infective embolic retinopathy as a sequela of bacterial endocarditis is described in a 31-year-old woman with mitral valve prolapse. The infective organism, Corynebacterium minutissimum, has not been previously found to cause ocular or multisystem diseases. It is a common mucocutaneous inhabitant which causes erythrasma. In our case report both ocular involvement and septicaemia were present. The infection was confirmed by positive serial blood cultures. Mitral valve prolapse was confirmed by echocardiography. On clinical examination the retinopathy consisted of white intraretinal lesions which resolved with antibiotic therapy. By fluorescein angiography focal areas of hypofluorescence corresponding to the white fundus lesions were present. Optic disc oedema was also seen.

Erythrasma is a superficial skin infection caused by Corynebacterium minutissimum . Interdigital erythrasma is the most common form and is easily confused with tinea pedis. The aim of this study was to determine the prevalence of interdigital erythrasma in patients with clinically suspected tinea pedis. This study was performed between January 1, 2011, and January 31, 2012. It included 182 patients who presented with concerns about interdigital lesions. All of the patients were examined with a Wood's lamp, and smears were stained with Gram's method. Direct examination with 20% potassium hydroxide was performed. Of 182 patients with interdigital lesions, 73 (40.1%) were diagnosed as having erythrasma. The mean ± SD age of the patients with erythrasma was 45.52 ± 10.83 years (range, 22-70 years). Most of the patients with erythrasma were women (56.2%). The most often clinical finding was desquamation. Using only Wood's lamp examination or Gram's staining resulted in 31 (42.5%) or 14 (19.2%) positive patients, respectively. Using Wood's lamp examination and Gram's staining concurrently resulted in 28 positive patients (38.4%). Interdigital erythrasma is a common condition and can be difficult to differentiate from tinea pedis. Simple and rapid diagnosis can be made with Wood's lamp examination, but Gram's staining is also a useful method, especially in patients with negative Wood's lamp examination findings.

Skin infections are common and may be caused by bacteria, fungi or viruses. Breaks in the skin integrity, particularly those that inoculate pathogens into the dermis, frequently cause or exacerbate skin infections. Bacterial skin infections caused by corynebacteria include erythrasma, trichomycosis axillaris and pitted keratolysis. Staphylococci may cause impetigo, ecthyma and folliculitis. Streptococcal skin infections include impetigo and erysipelas. Human papillomavirus skin infections present as several different types of warts, depending on the surface infected and its relative moisture, and the patterns of pressure. The many dermatomycoses (skin infections caused by fungi or yeasts) include tinea capitis, tinea barbae, tinea cruris, tinea manus, tinea pedis and tinea unguium (onychomycosis). Candidal infections occur in moist areas, such as the vulva, mouth, penis, skinfolds and diaper area. Wounds caused by wood splinters or thorns may result in sporotrichosis. Animal bites may result in complex, serious infections, requiring tetanus and, possibly, rabies prophylaxis in addition to appropriate antibiotic therapy.

Corynebacterium spp. are diphtheroid bacteria responsible for pitted keratolysis, a common plantar infection confined to the thick stratum corneum. To study a series of demographic features of patients suffering from pitted keratolysis, and to present a review of the Corynebacterium-associated infections, including pitted keratolysis, erythrasma, and trichobacteriosis. A 2-year, two-center, prospective survey assessed the demographics of pitted keratolysis, including age, gender, site of infection, symptoms, patients' complaints, the use of protective and/or occlusive shoes, seasonality of diagnosis, drug intake, associated skin signs (including dyshidrosis, erythrasma, and trichobacteriosis), recurrences, and previous diagnoses and treatments. The mean age of the 53 patients with pitted keratolysis was 24.9 years (range, 10-57 years). The male to female ratio was 7.8:1. The soles of both feet were commonly involved (92.4%). Pressure-bearing areas were the usual sites of infection, ranging from restricted involvement of the toes (12/53, 22.6%) to spreading to the entire plantar surface (15/53, 28.3%). A total of 36 (68%) of the 53 patients complained of hyperhidrosis. An unpleasant smell and pain were noted by 35 (66%) and 25 (47%) of the 53 patients, respectively. Occlusive and protective shoes were worn in 51 (96.2%) and 31 (58.4%) of the 53 cases, respectively. Pitted keratolysis commonly affects young male patients wearing protective shoes for professional reasons, inducing a moist and warm environment. Hyperhidrosis, an unpleasant smell, and pain are the main clinical complaints.

Erythrasma is a superficial skin disease caused by Gram-positive Corynebacterium species. Coral-red fluorescence under Wood's light, strongly suggestive of erythrasma, can be attributed to the presence of porphyrins. Fractionated porphyrin analysis in erythrasma lesions is yet to be reported. We attempted to investigate erythrasma lesions by isolating the responsible bacteria and determining their exogenous porphyrin production by HPLC analysis. We observed a 78-year-old woman with erythrasma who had a well-demarcated slightly scaling patch on her left foot, between the fourth and fifth toes. Two kinds of colonies on 5 % sheep blood agar were obtained from this lesion. Analysis of the 16S rRNA sequence revealed the colonies to be Corynebacterium aurimucosum and Microbacterium oxydans. HPLC analysis demonstrated that coproporphyrin III (Copro III) levels were clearly elevated, although the amounts of protoporphyrin were diminished. These results indicate that the fluorescent substance was Copro III. This study supports the view that excess Copro III synthesis by C. aurimucosum and M. oxydans leads to accumulation of porphyrin in cutaneous tissue, which emits a coral-red fluorescence when exposed to Wood's light.

Bacterial skin infections are important to recognize because we have the means to eradicate almost all of them. Primary skin infections are mainly caused by staphylococci or streptococci. Staphylococci infections present as furuncles and carbuncles, superficial folliculitis, impetigo or rarely the Scalded Skin Syndrome. Streptococcal infections present as impetigo, ecthyma, erysipelas or cellulitis. Corynebacteria causes erythrasma, trichomycosis or pitted keratolysis. Gram-negative primary skin infections, although uncommon, may occur; bacterial cultures are generally necessary for diagnosis. Secondary bacterial infections of pre-existing wounds, burns, dermatitic skin, or retention cysts are common events.
