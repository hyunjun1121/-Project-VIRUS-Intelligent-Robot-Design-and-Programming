Kabuki syndrome is a rare genetic disorder, caused by mutation in the KMT2D or KDM6A genes, which affects several organs in the majority of patients, among which are the eyes. The most typical clinical characteristics are mental retardation, postnatal growth retardation, skeletal anomalies, and characteristic facial features. As the eyes are affected in most of the cases, ophthalmological examination is recommended for the early detection of ocular anomalies, in order to prevent visual impairment. The most frequent ocular signs are strabismus, ptosis, and refractive anomalies. A series of cases of Kabuki syndrome is described in five children, four of whom exhibited strabismus with esotropia, over action of inferior oblique muscles, and under action of superior oblique muscles associated with a V pattern. Most published papers do not report or might underestimate the ocular problems. It may be appropriate to perform orbital magnetic resonances in order to detect changes in the muscle paths that are related to the pathology of the eye movements found.

Kabuki syndrome, a congenital craniofacial disorder, manifests from mutations in an X-linked histone H3 lysine 27 demethylase (UTX/KDM6A) or a H3 lysine 4 methylase (KMT2D). However, the cellular and molecular etiology of histone-modifying enzymes in craniofacial disorders is unknown. We now establish Kabuki syndrome as a neurocristopathy, whereby the majority of clinical features are modeled in mice carrying neural crest (NC) deletion of UTX, including craniofacial dysmorphism, cardiac defects, and postnatal growth retardation. Female UTX NC knockout (FKO) demonstrates enhanced phenotypic severity over males (MKOs), due to partial redundancy with UTY, a Y-chromosome demethylase-dead homolog. Thus, NC cells may require demethylase-independent UTX activity. Consistently, Kabuki causative point mutations upstream of the JmjC domain do not disrupt UTX demethylation. We have isolated primary NC cells at a phenocritical postmigratory timepoint in both FKO and MKO mice, and genome-wide expression and histone profiling have revealed UTX molecular function in establishing appropriate chromatin structure to regulate crucial NC stem-cell signaling pathways. However, the majority of UTX regulated genes do not experience aberrations in H3K27me3 or H3K4me3, implicating alternative roles for UTX in transcriptional control. These findings are substantiated through demethylase-dead knockin mutation of UTX, which supports appropriate facial development.

The type 2 lysine methyltransferases KMT2C and KMT2D are large, enzymatically active scaffold proteins that form the core of nuclear regulatory structures known as KMT2C/D COMPASS complexes (complex of proteins associating with Set1). These evolutionarily conserved proteins regulate DNA promoter and enhancer elements, modulating the activity of diverse cell types critical for embryonic morphogenesis, central nervous system development, and post-natal survival. KMT2C/D COMPASS complexes and their binding partners enhance active gene expression of specific loci via the targeted modification of histone-3 tail residues, in general promoting active euchromatic conformations. Over the last 20 years, mutations in five key COMPASS complex genes have been linked to three human congenital syndromes: Kabuki syndrome (type 1 [KMT2D] and 2 [KDM6A]), Rubinstein-Taybi syndrome (type 1 [CBP] and 2 [EP300]), and Kleefstra syndrome type 2 (KMT2C). Here, we review the composition and biochemical function of the KMT2 complexes. The specific cellular and embryonic roles of the KMT2C/D COMPASS complex are highlight with a focus on clinically relevant mechanisms sensitive to haploinsufficiency. The phenotypic similarities and differences between the members of this new family of disorders are outlined and emerging therapeutic strategies are detailed.

Kabuki syndrome (KS) is a rare congenital anomaly syndrome affecting multiple organs. Two genes have been shown to be mutated in patients with KS: lysine (K)-specific demethylase 6A (KDM6A) and lysine (K)-specific methyltransferase 2D (KMT2D, formerly MLL2). Although the congenital clinical characteristic is helpful in diagnosis of the KS, there are no reports of specific findings in fetuses that might suggest the syndrome prenatally. In this study, we described a male patient with a novel KDM6A splicing in exon(exon4) and flanking intron(intron3)-exon boundaries characterized by congenital hydrocephalus which had never been reported before. The male patient had inherited the c.335-1G > T splice site mutation from his mother who had fewer dysmorphic features than the patient who displayed a more severe phenotype with multiple organ involvement. Our research suggests that congenital hydrocephalus may accompany KS type 2, which improve the knowledge on KS further more. Based on genetic and clinical features, suggest that the c.335-1G > T splicing mutation in KDM6A causing KS-2 disease. At least for this case, we suggest that congenital hydrocephalus is closely associated with KS type 2.

KBG syndrome is a rare, autosomal dominant disorder caused by mutations or deletions leading to haploinsufficiency for the Ankrin Repeating Domain-Containing protein 11 (ANKRD11) at chromosome 16q24.3. Kabuki syndrome is caused by mutations or deletions of lysine (K)-specific methyltransferase 2D (KMT2D) and lysine-specific methylase 6A (KDM6A). We report on a male with developmental delays, cleft palate, craniofacial dysmorphism, hypotonia, and central nervous system anomalies including diminished white matter with thinning of the corpus callosum. Exome sequencing revealed a de novo mutation in ANKRD11, c.2606_2608delAGA, predicting p.Lys869del and an additional, de novo mutation, c.2353T>C, predicting p.Tyr785His in KDM1A, a gene not previously associated with a human phenotype. We describe this child as the first report of a deleterious sequence variant in KDM1A and hypothesize that his phenotype resulted from the combined effect of both mutations.

Kabuki syndrome is a rare genetic disorder characterized by distinct dysmorphic facial features, intellectual disability, and multiple developmental abnormalities. Despite more than 350 documented cases, the oro-dental spectrum associated with kabuki syndrome and expression of <i>KMT2D</i> (histone-lysine N-methyltransferase 2D) or <i>KDM6A</i> (lysine-specific demethylase 6A) genes in tooth development have not been well defined. Here, we report seven unrelated Thai patients with Kabuki syndrome having congenital absence of teeth, malocclusion, high-arched palate, micrognathia, and deviated tooth shape and size. Exome sequencing successfully identified that six patients were heterozygous for mutations in <i>KMT2D</i>, and one in <i>KDM6A</i>. Six were novel mutations, of which five were in <i>KMT2D</i> and one in <i>KDM6A</i>. They were truncating mutations including four frameshift deletions and two nonsense mutations. The predicted non-functional KMT2D and KDM6A proteins are expected to cause disease by haploinsufficiency. Our study expands oro-dental, medical, and mutational spectra associated with Kabuki syndrome. We also demonstrate for the first time that <i>KMT2D</i> and <i>KDM6A</i> are expressed in the dental epithelium of human tooth germs.

Lysine methyltransferase 2D (KMT2D; OMIM 602113) encodes a histone methyltransferase involved in transcriptional regulation of the beta-globin and estrogen receptor as part of a large protein complex known as activating signal cointegrator-2-containing complex (ASCOM). Heterozygous germline mutations in the KMT2D gene are known to cause Kabuki syndrome (OMIM 147920), a developmental multisystem disorder. Neither holoprosencephaly nor other defects in human forebrain development have been previously associated with Kabuki syndrome. Here we report two patients diagnosed with alobar holoprosencephaly in their antenatal period with de novo monoallelic KMT2D variants identified by trio-based exome sequencing. The first patient was found to have a stop-gain variant c.12565G>T (p.Gly4189*), while the second patient had a missense variant c.5A>G (p.Asp2Gly). Phenotyping of each patient did not reveal any age-related feature of Kabuki syndrome. These two cases represent the first report on association between KMT2D and holoprosencephaly.

Kabuki syndrome (KS) is a rare condition with multiple congenital anomalies and mental retardation. Exonic deletions, disrupting the lysine (K)-specific demethylase 6A (KDM6A) gene have been demonstrated as rare cause of KS. Here, we report a de novo 227-kb deletion in chromosome Xp11.3 of a 7-year-old Chinese girl with KS. Besides the symptoms of KS, the patient also presented with skin allergic manifestations, which were considered to be a new, rare feature of the phenotypic spectrum. The deletion includes the upstream region and exons 1-2 of KDM6A and potentially causes haploinsuffiency of the gene. We also discuss the mutation spectrum of KDM6A and clinical variability of patients with KDM6A deletion through a literature review. © 2016 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

Kabuki syndrome (KS) is a rare congenital disorder characterized by distinctive facies, postnatal growth deficiency, cardiac defects and skeletal anomalies. Studies have determined that pathogenic variants of the lysine-specific methyltransferase 2D (KMT2D) and lysine-specific demethylase 6A (KDM6A) genes are the major causes of KS. The two genes encode different histone-modifying enzymes that are found in the same protein complex that is critical for cell differentiation during development. Here we report the results from next-generation sequencing of genomic DNA from 13 patients who had a clinical diagnosis of KS based on facial dysmorphism and other KS-specific cardinal phenotypes. Nine of the 13 patients were confirmed to be carrying heterozygous pathogenic KMT2D variants, seven of which were truncating and two were missense substitutions. Overall, we uncovered 11 novel variants - nine in KMT2D and two in KDM6A. Seven of the novel variants (all KMT2D) were likely causative of the KS phenotype. Our study expands the number of naturally occurring KMT2D and KDM6A variants. The discovery of novel pathogenic variants will add to the knowledge on disease-causing variants and the relevance of missense variants in KS.

Kabuki syndrome (OMIM: 147920) is a rare condition, mainly associating intellectual deficiency, a polymalformative syndrome, and specific morphological changes in the face. It nevertheless has a strong clinical and biological heterogeneity with rarer but very different symptoms (endocrinological anomalies, autoimmune disorders, obesity, etc.). Clinical diagnosis is difficult because it is based on a spectrum of clinical, radiological, and biological factors. Complications are numerous, sometimes interpenetrating, and early diagnosis of the disease is essential for optimal management. The development of genetic testing is therefore essential for the diagnosis of this disease. Recently, exome sequencing has helped identify two genes responsible for the disease: KMT2D (lysine (K)-specific methyltransferase 2D, better known as MLL2 - mixed lineage leukemia), and KDM6A (lysine-specific demethylase 6A). Functional studies of these genes should help clarify their role in the pathogenesis of the disease, in particular to test the hypothesis of epigenetic changes during embryogenesis and development. Finally, understanding the interactions between KMT2D and its target genes could unravel other candidate genes for hitherto unexplained Kabuki syndrome cases.

Lysine demethylase 6A (KDM6A), also known as UTX, belongs to the KDM6 family of histone H3 lysine 27 (H3K27) demethylases, which also includes UTY and KDM6B (JMJD3). The KDM6A protein contains six tetratricopeptide repeat (TPR) domains and an enzymatic Jumonji C (JmjC) domain that catalyzes the removal of di- and trimethylation on H3K27. KDM6A physically associates with histone H3 lysine 4 monomethyltransferases MLL3 (KMT2C) and MLL4 (KMT2D). Since its identification as an H3K27 demethylase in 2007, studies have reported KDM6A's critical roles in cell differentiation, development, and cancer. KDM6A is important for differentiation of embryonic stem cells and development of various tissues. Mutations of KDM6A cause Kabuki syndrome. KDM6A is frequently mutated in cancers and functions as a tumor suppressor. KDM6A is redundant with UTY and functions largely independently of its demethylase activity. It regulates gene expression, likely through the associated transcription factors and MLL3/4 on enhancers. However, KDM6A enzymatic activity is required in certain cellular contexts. Functional redundancy between H3K27 demethylase activities of KDM6A and KDM6B <i>in vivo</i> has yet to be determined. Further understanding of KDM6A functions and working mechanisms will provide more insights into enhancer regulation and may help generate novel therapeutic approaches to treat KDM6A-related diseases.

Kabuki syndrome (KS) is a rare disorder of transcriptional regulation with a complex phenotype that includes cranio-facial dysmorphism, intellectual disability, hypotonia, failure to thrive, short stature, and cardiac and renal anomalies. Heterozygous, de novo dominant mutations in either KMT2D or KDM6A underlie KS. Limited information is available about the phenotypic spectrum of KS in China. Fourteen Chinese patients with genetically confirmed KS were evaluated in addition to 11 Chinese patients who were identified from the medical literature. The clinical phenotype spectrum of these patients was compared to that of 449 patients with KS from non-Chinese ethnicities. Additionally, we explored the utility of a facial recognition software in recognizing KS. All 25 patients with KS carried de novo, likely pathogenic or pathogenic variants in either KMT2D or KDM6A. Eighteen patients were male, the age at diagnosis ranged from 2months to 11.6 years. The facial gestalt included arched and broad eyebrows (25/25; 100%), sparse lateral or notched eyebrows (18/18; 100%), short columella with a concave nasal tip (24/25; 96%) and large, prominent ears (24/24; 100%) which were more frequent in Chinese patients (p < .01). In contrast, microcephaly (2/25; 8%), cleft lip/palate (2/25; 8%), and cardiac defects (10/25; 40%) were less frequent in Chinese patients (not significant). The diagnosis of KS was correctly identified in 13 of 14 patients through facial recognition and clinical phenotyping, underscoring the utility of this approach. As expected, there is marked phenotypic overlap between Chinese and non-Chinese patients with KS, although subtle differences were identified.
