Which disease is treated with Eliglustat?

[PMID: 25256118]
Clonal B-cell proliferation is a frequent manifestation of Gaucher disease - a sphingolipidosis associated with a high risk of multiple myeloma and non-Hodgkin lymphoma. Gaucher disease is caused by genetic deficiency of acid β-glucosidase, the natural substrates of which (β-d-glucosylceramide and β-d-glucosylsphingosine) accumulate, principally in macrophages. Mice with inducible deficiency of β-glucosidase [Gba(tm1Karl/tm1Karl)Tg(MX1-cre)1Cgn/0] serve as an authentic model of human Gaucher disease; we have recently reported clonal B-cell proliferation accompanied by monoclonal serum paraproteins and cognate tumours in these animals. To explore the relationship between B-cell malignancy and the biochemical defect, we treated Gaucher mice with eliglustat tartrate (GENZ 112638), a potent and selective inhibitor of the first committed step in glycosphingolipid biosynthesis. Twenty-two Gaucher mice received 300 mg/kg of GENZ 112638 daily for 3-10 months from 6 weeks of age. Plasma concentrations of β-d-glucosylceramide and the unacylated glycosphingolipid, β-d-glucosylsphingosine, declined. After administration of GENZ 112638 to Gaucher mice for 3-10 months, serum paraproteins were not detected and there was a striking reduction in the malignant lymphoproliferation: neither lymphomas nor plasmacytomas were found in animals that had received the investigational agent. In contrast, 14 out of 60 Gaucher mice without GENZ 112638 treatment developed these tumours; monoclonal paraproteins were detected in plasma from 18 of the 44 age-matched mice with Gaucher disease that had not received GENZ 112638. Long-term inhibition of glycosphingolipid biosynthesis suppresses the development of spontaneous B-cell lymphoma and myeloma in Gaucher mice.

Gaucher disease type 1 is characterized by hepatosplenomegaly, anemia, thrombocytopenia, and skeletal disease. A safe, effective oral therapy is needed. To determine whether eliglustat, a novel oral substrate reduction therapy, safely reverses clinical manifestations in untreated adults with Gaucher disease type 1. Phase 3, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial conducted at 18 sites in 12 countries from November 2009 to July 2012 among eligible patients with splenomegaly plus thrombocytopenia and/or anemia. Of 72 patients screened, 40 were enrolled. Patients were stratified by spleen volume and randomized 1:1 to receive eliglustat (50 or 100 mg twice daily; n = 20) or placebo (n = 20) for 9 months. The primary efficacy end point was percentage change in spleen volume in multiples of normal from baseline to 9 months; secondary efficacy end points were change in hemoglobin level and percentage changes in liver volume and platelet count. All patients had baseline splenomegaly and thrombocytopenia (mostly moderate or severe), most had mild or moderate hepatomegaly, and 20% had mild anemia. Least-square mean spleen volume decreased by 27.77% (95% CI, -32.57% to -22.97%) in the eliglustat group (from 13.89 to 10.17 multiples of normal) vs an increase of 2.26% (95% CI, -2.54% to 7.06%) in the placebo group (from 12.50 to 12.84 multiples of normal) for an absolute treatment difference of -30.03% (95% CI, -36.82% to -23.24%; P < .001). For the secondary end points, the least-square mean absolute differences between groups all favored eliglustat, with a 1.22-g/dL increase in hemoglobin level (95% CI, 0.57-1.88 g/dL; P < .001), 6.64% decrease in liver volume (95% CI, -11.37% to -1.91%; P = .007), and 41.06% increase in platelet count (95% CI, 23.95%-58.17%; P < .001). No serious adverse events occurred. One patient in the eliglustat group withdrew (non-treatment related); 39 of the 40 patients transitioned to an open-label extension study. Among previously untreated adults with Gaucher disease type 1, treatment with eliglustat compared with placebo for 9 months resulted in significant improvements in spleen volume, hemoglobin level, liver volume, and platelet count. The clinical significance of these findings is uncertain, and more definitive conclusions about clinical efficacy and utility will require comparison with the standard treatment of enzyme replacement therapy as well as longer-term follow-up. clinicaltrials.gov Identifier: NCT00891202.

Eliglustat is an investigational, oral substrate reduction therapy for Gaucher disease type 1 (GD1). Nineteen treatment-naïve patients have now completed 4years of an open-label study (NCT00358150). Mean hemoglobin level and platelet count increased by 2.3±1.5g/dL (baseline: 11.3±1.5g/dL) and 95% (baseline: 68,700±21,200/mm(3)), respectively. Mean spleen and liver volumes (multiples of normal, MN) decreased by 63% (baseline: 17.3±9.5 MN) and 28% (baseline: 1.7±0.4 MN), respectively. Median chitotriosidase and CCL-18 each decreased by 82%; plasma glucosylceramide and GM3 normalized. Mean bone mineral density T-score for the lumbar spine increased by 0.8 (60%) (baseline: -1.6±1.1). Femur dark marrow, a reflection of Gaucher cell infiltration into bone marrow, was reduced or stable in 17/18 patients. There were no bone crises. Most adverse events were mild and unrelated to treatment. These results extend the safety and efficacy of eliglustat reported at 1 and 2 years to 4 years.

Three phase 1 studies of eliglustat tartrate (Genz-112638), an oral inhibitor of glucosylceramide synthase under development for treating Gaucher disease type 1 (GD1), evaluated the safety, tolerability, and pharmacokinetics in healthy volunteers after escalating single doses (n = 99), escalating multiple doses (n = 36), and food (n = 24). Eliglustat tartrate was well tolerated at single doses ≤ 20 mg/kg and multiple doses ≤ 200 mg bid, with 50 mg bid producing plasma concentrations in the predicted therapeutic range. No serious adverse events occurred. Mild to moderate events of nausea, dizziness, and vomiting increased in frequency with escalating single and multiple doses. Single doses ≥ 10 mg/kg caused mild increases in electrocardiogram PR, QRS, and QT/QTc intervals. Single-dose pharmacokinetics showed dose linearity but not proportionality. Maximum plasma concentrations occurred at ~2 hours, followed by a monophasic decline with a ~6-hour terminal half-life. Unchanged drug in 8-hour urine collections was <1.5% of administered doses. Food did not significantly affect the rate or extent of absorption. Multiple-dose pharmacokinetics was nonlinear, showing higher than expected plasma drug concentrations. Steady state was reached ~60 hours after bid dosing. Higher drug exposure occurred in slower CYP2D6 metabolizers. Based on favorable results in healthy participants, a phase 2 trial of eliglustat tartrate was initiated in GD1 patients.

The mainstay of treatment for Gaucher's disease type 1 is alternate-week infusion of enzyme replacement therapy (ERT). We investigated whether patients stable on such treatment would remain so after switching to oral eliglustat, a selective inhibitor of glucosylceramide synthase. In this phase 3, randomised, multinational, open-label, non-inferiority trial, we enrolled adults (aged ≥18 years) who had received ERT for 3 years or more for Gaucher's disease. Patients were randomly allocated 2:1 at 39 clinics (stratified by ERT dose; block sizes of four; computer-generated centrally) to receive either oral eliglustat or imiglucerase infusions for 12 months. Participants and investigators were aware of treatment assignment, but the central reader who assessed organ volumes was masked. The composite primary efficacy endpoint was percentage of patients whose haematological variables and organ volumes remained stable for 12 months (ie, haemoglobin decrease not more than 15 g/L, platelet count decrease not more than 25%, spleen volume increase not more than 25%, and liver volume increase not more than 20%, in multiples of normal from baseline). The non-inferiority margin was 25% for eliglustat relative to imiglucerase, assessed in all patients who completed 12 months of treatment. This trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT00943111, and EudraCT, number 2008-005223-28. Between Sept 15, 2009, and Nov 9, 2011, we randomly allocated 106 (66%) patients to eliglustat and 54 (34%) to imiglucerase. In the per-protocol population, 84 (85%) of 99 patients who completed eliglustat treatment and 44 (94%) of 47 patients who completed imiglucerase treatment met the composite primary endpoint (between-group difference -8·8%; 95% CI -17·6 to 4·2). The lower bound of the 95% CI of -17·6% was within the prespecified threshold for non-inferiority. Dropouts occurred due to palpitations (one patient on eliglustat), myocardial infarction (one patient on eliglustat), and psychotic disorder (one patient on imiglucerase). No deaths occurred. 97 (92%) of 106 patients in the eliglustat group had treatment-emergent adverse events, as did 42 (79%) of 53 in the imiglucerase group (mostly mild or moderate in severity). Oral eliglustat maintained haematological and organ volume stability in adults with Gaucher's disease type 1 already controlled by intravenous ERT and could be a useful therapeutic option.

Eliglustat tartrate (Genz-112638), a specific inhibitor of glucosylceramide synthase, is under development as an oral substrate reduction therapy for Gaucher disease type 1 (GD1). A multinational, open-label, single-arm phase 2 study of 26 GD1 patients (16 female, 10 male; mean age, 34 years) evaluated the efficacy, safety, and pharmacokinetics of eliglustat tartrate administered twice daily by mouth at 50- or 100-mg doses based on plasma drug concentrations. Entry criteria required splenomegaly with thrombocytopenia and/or anemia. The composite primary efficacy end point required improvement after 52 weeks in at least 2 of these 3 disease manifestations and was met by 77% (95% confidence interval [CI] = 58%-89%) of all patients and 91% (95% CI = 72%-98%) of the 22 patients completing 52 weeks. Statistically significant improvements occurred in mean hemoglobin level (1.62 g/dL; 95% CI =1.05-2.18 g/dL), platelet count (40.3%; 95% CI = 23.7-57.0 g/dL), spleen volume (-38.5%; 95% CI = -43.5%--33.5%), liver volume (-17.0%; 95% CI = -21.6%-12.3%), and lumbar spine bone mineral density (0.31 Z-score; 95% CI = 0.09-0.53). Elevated biomarkers (chitotriosidase; chemokine CCL18; angiotensin-converting enzyme; tartrate-resistant acid phosphatase) decreased by 35% to 50%. Plasma glucosylceramide and ganglioside GM3 normalized. Eliglustat tartrate was well tolerated: 7 mild, transient adverse events in 6 patients were considered treatment-related. Individual pharmacokinetics varied; mean time to maximal observed concentration was 2.3 hours and mean half-life was 6.8 hours. Eliglustat tartrate appears to be a promising oral treatment for GD1.

Eliglustat is an investigational oral substrate reduction therapy for Gaucher disease type 1 (GD1). Its skeletal effects were evaluated by prospective monitoring of bone mineral density (BMD), fractures, marrow infiltration by Gaucher cells, focal bone lesions, and infarcts during an open-label, multi-site, single-arm phase 2 trial (NCT00358150). Institutional review board approval and patient informed consent were obtained. Eliglustat (50 or 100 mg) was self-administered by mouth twice daily; 19 patients completed 4 years of treatment. All were skeletally mature (age range, 18-55 years). DXA and MRI assessments were conducted at baseline and annually thereafter. X-rays were obtained annually until month 24, and then every other year. Lumbar spine BMD increased significantly (p = 0.02; n = 15) by a mean (SD) of 9.9% (14.2%) from baseline to year 4; corresponding T-scores increased significantly (p = 0.01) from a mean (SD) of -1.6 (1.1) to -0.9 (1.3). Mean femur T-score remained normal through 4 years. Femur MRI showed that 10/18 (56%) patients had decreased Gaucher cell infiltration compared to baseline; one patient with early improvement had transient worsening at year 4. There were no lumbar spine or femoral fractures and no reported bone crises during the study. At baseline, 8/19 (42%) patients had focal bone lesions, which remained stable, and 7/19 (37%) patients had bone infarctions, which improved in one patient by year 2. At year 4, one new asymptomatic, indeterminate bone lesion was discovered that subsequently resolved. Eliglustat may be a therapeutic option for treating the skeletal manifestations of GD1.

Synthesis inhibition is the basis for the treatment of type 1 Gaucher disease by the glucosylceramide synthase (GCS) inhibitor eliglustat tartrate. However, the extended use of eliglustat and related compounds for the treatment of glycosphingolipid storage diseases with CNS manifestations is limited by the lack of brain penetration of this drug. Property modeling around the D-threo-1-phenyl-2-decanoylamino-3-morpholino-propanol (PDMP) pharmacophore was employed in a search for compounds of comparable activity against the GCS but lacking P-glycoprotein (MDR1) recognition. Modifications of the carboxamide N-acyl group were made to lower total polar surface area and rotatable bond number. Compounds were screened for inhibition of GCS in crude enzyme and whole cell assays and for MDR1 substrate recognition. One analog, 2-(2,3-dihydro-1H-inden-2-yl)-N-((1R,2R)-1-(2,3-dihydrobenzo[b][1,4]dioxin-6-yl)-1-hydroxy-3-(pyrrolidin-1-yl)propan-2-yl)acetamide (CCG-203586), was identified that inhibited GCS at low nanomolar concentrations with little to no apparent recognition by MDR1. Intraperitoneal administration of this compound to mice for 3 days resulted in a significant dose dependent decrease in brain glucosylceramide content, an effect not seen in mice dosed in parallel with eliglustat tartrate.

Eliglustat tartrate is an investigational oral substrate reduction therapy for Gaucher disease type 1 that is pharmacologically distinct from intravenous enzyme replacement therapy. Eliglustat tartrate improved clinical manifestations in patients who received 50 or 100 mg twice daily for 1 year during an open-label phase 2 study (Blood. 2010;116(6):893-899). We report further improvements after 2 years of treatment in 20 patients (11 females, 9 males; mean age, 33 years) with baseline splenomegaly and thrombocytopenia and/or anemia. Statistically significant (P < .001) percentage improvements from baseline occurred in platelet count (mean ± SD, 81% ± 56%), hemoglobin level (20% ± 15%), spleen volume (-52% ± 11%), and liver volume (-24% ± 13%). Mean platelet count increased ∼ 50 000/mm(3). Mean hemoglobin level increased 2.1 g/dL overall and 3.1 g/dL in 10 patients with baseline anemia. Organ volume reductions were greatest in patients with severe baseline organomegaly. Seventeen (85%) patients met established therapeutic goals for ≥ 3 of the 4 parameters. Lumbar spine bone mineral density increased 7.8% ± 10.6% (P = .01) and T-score 0.6 ± 0.8 (P = .012), with major gains in osteoporotic and osteopenic patients. Magnetic resonance imaging assessment showed that bone marrow infiltration by Gaucher cells was decreased (8/18 patients) or stable (10/18 patients). No safety-related trends emerged during 2 years of treatment. This multisite, open-label, single-arm phase 2 study is registered at www.clinicaltrials.gov as NCT00358150.
