What is the link between psoriatic arthritis and depression

[PMID: 22556134]
Symptoms of psychological distress, including anxiety and depressive symptoms, and illness perceptions are important in determining outcome in patients with rheumatic disease. We aimed to compare psychological distress in psoriatic arthritis (PsA) and rheumatoid arthritis (RA) and to test whether the association between psychological variables and health-related quality of life (HRQOL) was similar in the 2 forms of arthritis. In 83 PsA patients and 199 RA patients, we used the Patient Health Questionnaire 9 (PHQ-9), the Symptom Checklist-90-Revised, and the Brief Illness Perception Questionnaire to assess psychological variables and the World Health Organization Quality of Life Instrument, Short Form to assess HRQOL. We used hierarchical regression analysis to determine the associations between psychological variables and HRQOL after adjusting for demographic variables and disease parameters. The prevalence of moderate to severe levels of depressive symptoms (PHQ-9 score ≥10) was 21.7% in PsA patients, 25.1% in RA patients, and 36.7% in those PsA patients with polyarthritis. After adjustment for severity of disease and pain, anxiety (β = -0.28) and concern about bodily symptoms attributed to the illness (β = -0.33) were independent correlates of physical HRQOL in PsA. In RA, depressive symptoms (β = -0.29) and concern about the consequences of the arthritis (β = -0.27) were independent correlates of physical HRQOL. These findings suggest strongly that psychological factors are important correlates of HRQOL in PsA as well as in RA. Attention to patients' anxiety and their concern about numerous bodily symptoms attributed to the illness may enable rheumatologists to identify and manage treatable aspects of HRQOL in PsA.

Psoriasis (Pso) is a common chronic cutaneous inflammatory disease involving the skin that is associated with serious comorbidities. Comorbidities in Pso include psoriatic arthritis (PsA), reduced quality of life, malignancy, depression, but also a constellation of associated conditions that enhance the cardiovascular (CV) risk. Indeed, obesity is common in patients with Pso or PsA and is considered to be a risk factor for the onset of these diseases. Patients with Pso and PsA share common obesity-related complications such as metabolic syndrome (MetS), dyslipidemia, diabetes or insulin resistance, and CV diseases. Chronic inflammation in Pso and PsA partially explains the development of atherosclerosis and CV diseases. In parallel, body composition is disturbed in patients with Pso or PsA, as suggested by anthropometric measurements, while an excess of abdominal adiposity is observed in PsA, enhancing the risk of MetS and CV diseases. Adipokines may link the adipose tissue to the obesity-related complications of Pso and PsA. Indeed, altered circulating levels of the adipokines leptin, adiponectin, visfatine, and resistin have been found in patients with Pso or PsA. In addition, an excess of adipose tissue may compromise the therapeutic response to traditional drugs or biological agents in Pso and PsA. This paper reviews the comorbidities that contribute to enhanced CV risk, the body composition results, and the potential role of adipokines in systemic inflammation and energetic balance in Pso and PsA.

As summarized in the first article in this continuing medical education series, the currently available epidemiologic data suggest that psoriasis may be a risk factor for cardiometabolic disease. Emerging data also suggest associations between psoriasis and other comorbidities beyond psoriatic arthritis, including chronic kidney disease, inflammatory bowel disease, hepatic disease, certain malignancies, infections, and mood disorders. Recognizing the comorbid disease burden of psoriasis is essential for ensuring comprehensive care of patients with psoriasis. The clinical implications of the comorbid diseases that are associated with psoriasis and recommendations for clinical management are reviewed in this article.

(1) To determine the prevalence of depression and anxiety in patients with psoriatic arthritis (PsA) and to identify associated demographic and disease-related factors. (2) To determine whether there is a difference in the prevalence of depression and anxiety between patients with PsA and those with psoriasis without PsA (PsC). Consecutive patients attending PsA and dermatology clinics were assessed for depression and anxiety using the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale. Patients underwent a clinical assessment according to a standard protocol and completed questionnaires assessing their health and quality of life. T tests, ANOVA, and univariate and multivariate models were used to compare depression and anxiety prevalence between patient cohorts and to determine factors associated with depression and anxiety. We assessed 306 patients with PsA and 135 with PsC. There were significantly more men in the PsA group (61.4% vs 48% with PsC) and they were more likely to be unemployed. The prevalence of both anxiety and depression was higher in patients with PsA (36.6% and 22.2%, respectively) compared to those with PsC (24.4% and 9.6%; p = 0.012, 0.002). Depression and/or anxiety were associated with unemployment, female sex, and higher actively inflamed joint count as well as disability, pain, and fatigue. In the multivariate reduced model, employment was protective for depression (OR 0.36) and a 1-unit increase on the fatigue severity scale was associated with an increased risk of depression (OR 1.5). The rate of depression and anxiety is significantly higher in patients with PsA than in those with PsC. Depression and anxiety are associated with disease-related factors.

Psoriasis treatments range from topical treatments and phototherapy to oral systemic medications and injections. Despite good control of the disease when applying appropriate treatments (according to disease severity, insurance parameters, patient preference, and patients' ability to adhere), continued advancements will allow even better symptomatic control, reduced adverse effects, and patient satisfaction. This review aims to assess traditional and new psoriasis treatments and how to apply them in clinical practice. A literature review on psoriasis treatments and clinical applications was performed using PubMed. Mild-to-moderate psoriasis treatments include topicals, localized phototherapy, and newer therapies combining two types of topicals, phototherapy with topicals, and easy-to-use foam and spray vehicles. Moderate-to-severe psoriasis therapies include monotherapy or various combinations of generalized phototherapy, oral treatments, and biologic agents, with new oral and biologic agents on the horizon. Dermatologists and primary care providers share roles in screening for associated comorbidities (including cardiovascular disorders, chronic kidney disease, Crohn disease, dyslipidemia, diabetes mellitus/insulin resistance, depression, metabolic syndrome, obesity, and psoriatic arthritis), managing patients' treatments, and reevaluating treatment needs as new therapies are approved. Continued advancements in psoriasis treatment and improvement in coordinated care will allow better overall care of patients with psoriasis.

Comorbidities such as cardiovascular diseases (CVD), cancer, osteoporosis, and depression are often underrecognized in patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA), psoriatic arthritis (PsA), or psoriasis (PsO). Recommendations may improve identification and treatment of comorbidities. The Canadian Dermatology-Rheumatology Comorbidity Initiative reviewed the literature to develop practical evidence-based recommendations for management of comorbidities in patients with RA, PsA, and PsO. Eight main topics regarding comorbidities in RA, PsA, and PsO were developed. MEDLINE, EMBASE, and the Cochrane Library (1960-12/2012), together with abstracts from major rheumatology and dermatology congresses (2010-2012), were searched for relevant publications. Selected articles were analyzed and metaanalyses performed whenever possible. A meeting including rheumatologists, dermatologists, trainees/fellows, and invited experts was held to develop consensus-based recommendations using a Delphi process with prespecified cutoff agreement. Level of agreement was measured using a 10-point Likert scale (1 = no agreement, 10 = full agreement) and the potential effect of recommendations on daily clinical practice was considered. Grade of recommendation (ranging from A to D) was determined according to the Oxford Centre for Evidence-Based Medicine evidence levels. A total of 17,575 articles were identified, of which 407 were reviewed. Recommendations were synthesized into 19 final recommendations ranging mainly from grade C to D, and relating to a large spectrum of comorbidities observed in clinical practice: CVD, obesity, osteoporosis, depression, infections, and cancer. Level of agreement ranged from 80.9% to 95.8%. These practical evidence-based recommendations can guide management of comorbidities in patients with RA, PsA, and PsO and optimize outcomes.

The factors that contribute to the development of psoriatic arthritis (PsA) among patients with psoriasis are not well known; however, systemic inflammation is believed to be important. On the basis of recent laboratory work demonstrating that major depressive disorder (MDD) is associated with increased systemic inflammation, we hypothesized that patients with psoriasis who develop MDD are at increased risk of subsequently developing PsA. We utilized The Health Improvement Network, a primary care medical records database, to identify 73,447 individuals with psoriasis. Patients were followed up to 25 years until the development of the primary outcome of PsA or the censor date. The exposure of interest was the development of MDD. Cox proportional-hazards models showed that patients with psoriasis who developed MDD were at significantly increased risk of subsequently developing PsA compared with patients who did not develop MDD, even after accounting for numerous covariates (hazard ratio 1.37, 95% confidence interval 1.05-1.80, P = 0.021). This result was maintained through numerous sensitivity analyses. These data support the hypothesis that MDD increases the risk of developing PsA among patients with psoriasis, suggesting a need for heightened prevention and management of MDD in patients with psoriasis.

To estimate rates of suicidal behaviors and treated depression in patients with psoriatic arthritis (PsA) in comparison to non-PsA patients. Using the Clinical Practice Research Datalink, we conducted a cohort study of patients with PsA compared to non-PsA patients. Patients with codes for suicidal behaviors (ideation, attempts, and suicide) and treated depression (diagnosis plus anti-depressant prescription) recorded during follow-up were identified as cases. We estimated incidence rates (IRs) and incidence rate ratios (IRRs) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) for each outcome and stratified results in the PsA cohort by receipt of systemic PsA drugs. The rates of suicide ideation, attempt, and suicide were similar for PsA and non-PsA patients [IRR = 0.99 (95%CI: 0.67-1.47), IRR = 1.07 (95%CI: 0.86-1.34), and 0.34 (95%CI: 0.05-2.48), respectively] and rates of suicidal behaviors were slightly higher among PsA patients who received PsA drugs compared to those who did not. PsA patients had slightly higher rate of treated depression compared to non-PsA patients [IRR = 1.38 (95%CI: 1.27-1.49)] and were significantly higher in PsA patients who received drugs [IRR = 1.59 (95%CI: 1.35-1.86)]. Rate of depression was higher in patients with PsA compared to non-PsA patients. The rate of suicidal behaviors was similar between the two cohorts.

FUNDAMENTAL AND OBJECTIVE: Psychological impairment is frequent in patients with rheumatic diseases. The aim of the study was to assess the prevalence of symptoms of anxiety and depression in patients with psoriatic arthritis attending rheumatology clinics. Multicentre cross-sectional study conducted in rheumatology clinics. Patients with psoriatic arthritis were recruited; variables retrieved were sociodemographic, clinical and patient centered (Hospital Anxiety and Depression scale o HADs, EQ-5D questionnaire, etc.). Prevalence in the study population was calculated as anxiety or depression symptoms by an HADs score ≥11 or those receiving pharmacological treatment. A logistics regression model was used to know which variables were related to symptoms of anxiety or depression. A total of 495 patients were included, 42.8% were women and median (SD) age was 50.4 (12.7) years. Prevalence of symptoms of anxiety were 29.7% and prevalence of symptoms of depression was 17,6%. Patients with anxiety or depression symptoms had all EQ-5D dimensions affected (p<0.01). Higher prevalence of anxiety was related to being a woman, a mixed onset pattern with respect to peripheral joints and those treated with DMARD alone with respect to DMARD+NSAID or biologic alone. A higher depression prevalence was related to being a woman and a mixed onset pattern with respect to peripheral joints. The prevalence of anxiety symptoms and the prevalence of depression symptoms are high among patients suffering psoriatic arthritis in the studied population.

Psoriasis is a common, chronic and inflammatory disease of the skin, which has been associated with depression in cross-sectional studies with limited adjustment for confounders. In this prospective cohort study, we investigated the risk of incident depression among individuals with psoriasis and psoriatic arthritis (PsA). We included 50 750 US female nurses from the Nurses' Health Study who were free of depression at baseline in 2000. Those participants who had ever self-reported clinician-diagnosed depression or regular use of antidepressants, or had a Mental Health Inventory score of ≤ 52 were excluded. In 2008, we retrospectively asked participants if they had ever received a physician's diagnosis of psoriasis or PsA. We defined depression as self-report of clinician-diagnosed depression or regular use of antidepressant medication. Time-dependent Cox proportional hazard models were used to estimate age and multivariate-adjusted relative risks (RRs) of clinical depression. After adjusting for covariates including body mass index, physical activity, smoking and the presence of major chronic conditions, the multivariate-adjusted RRs of clinical depression were 1·29 [95% confidence interval (CI) 1·10-1·52] for women with psoriasis and 1·52 (95% CI 1·06-2·19) for women with psoriasis and concomitant PsA, compared with women without psoriasis. We found an increased risk of depression in US women with psoriasis compared with those without psoriasis. This risk was higher in those who reported concomitant PsA. Future studies are needed to confirm these findings in other populations and to identify pathophysiological mechanisms linking psoriasis to depression.

To investigate the predictive value of baseline depression/anxiety on the likelihood of achieving joint remission in rheumatoid arthritis (RA) and psoriatic arthritis (PsA) as well as the associations between baseline depression/anxiety and the components of the remission criteria at follow-up. We included 1326 patients with RA and 728 patients with PsA from the prospective observational NOR-DMARD study starting first-time tumour necrosis factor inhibitors or methotrexate. The predictive value of depression/anxiety on remission was explored in prespecified logistic regression models and the associations between baseline depression/anxiety and the components of the remission criteria in prespecified multiple linear regression models. Baseline depression/anxiety according to EuroQoL-5D-3L, Short Form-36 (SF-36) Mental Health subscale ≤56 and SF-36 Mental Component Summary ≤38 negatively predicted 28-joint Disease Activity Score <2.6, Simplified Disease Activity Index ≤3.3, Clinical Disease Activity Index ≤2.8, ACR/EULAR Boolean and Disease Activity Index for Psoriatic Arthritis ≤4 remission after 3 and 6 months treatment in RA (p≤0.008) and partly in PsA (p from 0.001 to 0.73). Baseline depression/anxiety was associated with increased patient's and evaluator's global assessment, tender joint count and joint pain in RA at follow-up, but not with swollen joint count and acute phase reactants. Depression and anxiety may reduce likelihood of joint remission based on composite scores in RA and PsA and should be taken into account in individual patients when making a shared decision on a treatment target.

Psoriasis is a chronic disease that affects more than the skin. It has an impact on every facet of an individual's life and is associated with numerous comorbidities, such as obesity, diabetes, cardiovascular disease, psoriatic arthritis, metabolic syndrome, squamous cell carcinoma, lymphoma, depression, anxiety and other immune-related conditions, such as Crohn's disease. Obesity is inextricably linked with type 2 diabetes, hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and cardiovascular disease. Hypertension and cardiovascular disease are precursors for myocardial infarction and stroke. Lifestyle choices, such as smoking, alcohol consumption, inadequate nutrition and physical exercise are behaviours that need to be addressed. With the right education from the community nurse, patients can be informed about the decisions they make and can ultimately choose to live a healthier life.

Non-adherence rates are high among patients with psoriasis, partly because of discordance between recommended treatments and individual preferences. Our aim was to assess the impact of comorbidities on patients' preferences for psoriasis treatments. A computer-based conjoint analysis experiment was conducted to analyze preferences of patients with psoriasis (N = 163) for treatment outcome attributes (probability, magnitude and duration of benefit; probability, severity and reversibility of side effects) and process attributes (treatment location, frequency, duration, delivery method, individual cost). The impact of comorbidities (psoriatic arthritis, cardiovascular disease, diabetes, and depression) on relative importance scores of each attribute was assessed by analyses of variance, post hoc test, and multivariate regression analysis. Among the participants included (58.9% males, mean age 49.3 yrs), 27% suffered from psoriatic arthritis, 13.5% from cardiovascular disease, 8% from diabetes, and 12.9% from depression. Preferences for treatment attributes varied significantly depending on comorbidities. Participants with psoriatic arthritis cared most about the probability of benefit (β 0.166; P = .037), whereas those participants with cardiovascular disease were highly concerned about the probability of side effects (β 0.179; P = .046). For participants with depression, treatment duration (β 0.163; P = .047), and individual cost (P = .023) were highly important. Only patients with moderate and severe psoriasis treated at a university medical center were included. Integrating patients' preferences into shared decision-making may facilitate treatment adherence and optimize outcomes. Addressing patients' comorbidities, particularly depression, may be a currently neglected opportunity to improve care.

Psoriasis is a chronic, genetic, inflammatory skin disease affecting approximately 2% of the population worldwide. Over the past decade, multiple studies have shown that not only is there an association between psoriasis and psoriatic arthritis, depression, and substance abuse, but psoriasis patients also have a higher incidence of obesity, diabetes, heart disease and stroke. In addition, and more concerning, young psoriatic patients particularly those with more severe disease are at an increased mortality risk even when controlling for these factors. The systemic inflammation in psoriasis generates elevation of C-reactive protein, homocysteine, and inflammatory cytokines such as TNF-a, IL-6, IL-17, IL-20, IL-22, and IL-23, which may contribute to the overall morbidity and mortality in these patients. Within this article we will discuss the associations between psoriasis and multiple systemic health problems.

Psoriasis is a systemic chronic inflammatory disease associated with comorbidity. Many epidemiological studies have shown that psoriasis is associated with psoriatic arthritis as well as cardiovascular and metabolic diseases. Furthermore, obesity and psychological diseases such as depression and anxiety disorders are linked with psoriasis and play a central role in its management. The association of psoriasis and its comorbidity can be partly explained by genetic and pathophysiological mechanisms. Approximately 40 psoriasis susceptibility loci have been described with the majority linked to the innate and adaptive immune system. In some associated diseases, such as psoriatic arthritis, an overlap of their genetic susceptibility exists. Pathophysiologically the "psoriatic march" is a model that describes the development of metabolic and cardiovascular diseases due to the presence of underlying systemic inflammation. Dermatologists are the gatekeepers to treatment for patients with psoriasis. The early detection and the management of comorbidity is part of their responsibility. Concepts for the management of psoriasis and tools to screen for psoriatic comorbidity have been developed in order to support dermatologists in daily practice.
