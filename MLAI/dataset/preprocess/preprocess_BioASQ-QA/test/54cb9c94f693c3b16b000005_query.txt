Heart failure is one of the leading causes of sudden death in developed countries. While current therapies are mostly aimed at mitigating associated symptoms, novel therapies targeting the subcellular mechanisms underlying heart failure are emerging. Failing hearts are characterized by reduced contractile properties caused by impaired Ca(2+) cycling between the sarcoplasm and sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR). Sarcoplasmic/ endoplasmic reticulum Ca(2+)ATPase 2a (SERCA2a) mediates Ca(2+) reuptake into the SR in cardiomyocytes. Of note, the expression level and/or activity of SERCA2a, translating to the quantity of SR Ca(2+) uptake, are significantly reduced in failing hearts. Normalization of the SERCA2a expression level by gene delivery has been shown to restore hampered cardiac functions and ameliorate associated symptoms in pre-clinical as well as clinical studies. SERCA2a activity can be regulated at multiple levels of a signaling cascade comprised of phospholamban, protein phosphatase 1, inhibitor-1, and PKCÎ±. SERCA2 activity is also regulated by post-translational modifications including SUMOylation and acetylation. In this review, we will highlight the molecular mechanisms underlying the regulation of SERCA2a activity and the potential therapeutic modalities for the treatment of heart failure.

Depressed sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR) calcium cycling, reflecting impaired SR Ca-transport and Ca-release, is a key and universal characteristic of human and experimental heart failure. These SR processes are regulated by multimeric protein complexes, including protein kinases and phosphatases as well as their anchoring and regulatory subunits that fine-tune Ca-handling in specific SR sub-compartments. SR Ca-transport is mediated by the SR Ca-ATPase (SERCA2a) and its regulatory phosphoprotein, phospholamban (PLN). Dephosphorylated PLN is an inhibitor of SERCA2a and phosphorylation by protein kinase A (PKA) or calcium-calmodulin-dependent protein kinases (CAMKII) relieves these inhibitory effects. Recent studies identified additional regulatory proteins, associated with PLN, that control SR Ca-transport. These include the inhibitor-1 (I-1) of protein phosphatase 1 (PP1), the small heat shock protein 20 (Hsp20) and the HS-1 associated protein X-1 (HAX1). In addition, the intra-luminal histidine-rich calcium binding protein (HRC) has been shown to interact with both SERCA2a and triadin. Notably, there is physical and direct interaction between these protein players, mediating a fine-cross talk between SR Ca-uptake, storage and release. Importantly, regulation of SR Ca-cycling by the PLN/SERCA interactome does not only impact cardiomyocyte contractility, but also survival and remodeling. Indeed, naturally occurring variants in these Ca-cycling genes modulate their activity and interactions with other protein partners, resulting in depressed contractility and accelerated remodeling. These genetic variants may serve as potential prognostic or diagnostic markers in cardiac pathophysiology.

Phospholamban has been suggested to be a key regulator of cardiac sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR) Ca cycling and contractility and a potential therapeutic target in restoring the depressed Ca cycling in failing hearts. Our understanding of the function of phospholamban stems primarily from studies in genetically altered mouse models. To evaluate the significance of this protein in larger mammalian species, which exhibit Ca cycling properties similar to humans, we overexpressed phospholamban in adult rabbit cardiomyocytes. Adenoviral-mediated gene transfer, at high multiplicities of infection, resulted in an insignificant 1.22-fold overexpression of phospholamban. There were no effects on twitch Ca-transient amplitude or decay under basal or isoproterenol-stimulated conditions. Furthermore, the SR Ca load and Na/Ca exchanger function were not altered. These apparent differences between phospholamban overexpression in rabbit compared with previous findings in the mouse may be due to a significantly higher (1.5-fold) endogenous phospholamban-to-sarco(endo)plasmic reticulum Ca-ATPase (SERCA) 2a ratio and potential functional saturation of SERCA2a by phospholamban in rabbit cardiomyocytes. The findings suggest that important species-dependent differences in phospholamban regulation of SERCA2a occur. In larger mammals, a higher fraction of SERCA2a pumps are regulated by phospholamban, and this may influence therapeutic strategies to enhance cardiac contractility and functional cardiac reserve.

Cardiac contractility is regulated through the activity of various key Ca(2+)-handling proteins. The sarco(endo)plasmic reticulum (SR) Ca(2+) transport ATPase (SERCA2a) and its inhibitor phospholamban (PLN) control the uptake of Ca(2+) by SR membranes during relaxation. Recently, the antiapoptotic HS-1-associated protein X-1 (HAX-1) was identified as a binding partner of PLN, and this interaction was postulated to regulate cell apoptosis. In the current study, we determined that HAX-1 can also bind to SERCA2. Deletion mapping analysis demonstrated that amino acid residues 575-594 of SERCA2's nucleotide binding domain are required for its interaction with the C-terminal domain of HAX-1, containing amino acids 203-245. In transiently cotransfected human embryonic kidney 293 cells, recombinant SERCA2 was specifically targeted to the ER, whereas HAX-1 selectively concentrated at mitochondria. On triple transfections with PLN, however, HAX-1 massively translocated to the ER membranes, where it codistributed with PLN and SERCA2. Overexpression of SERCA2 abrogated the protective effects of HAX-1 on cell survival, after hypoxia/reoxygenation or thapsigargin treatment. Importantly, HAX-1 overexpression was associated with down-regulation of SERCA2 expression levels, resulting in significant reduction of apparent ER Ca(2+) levels. These findings suggest that HAX-1 may promote cell survival through modulation of SERCA2 protein levels and thus ER Ca(2+) stores.

Dilated cardiomyopathy and end-stage heart failure result in multiple defects in cardiac excitation-contraction coupling. Via complementation of a genetically based mouse model of dilated cardiomyopathy, we now provide evidence that progressive chamber dilation and heart failure are dependent on a Ca2+ cycling defect in the cardiac sarcoplasmic reticulum. The ablation of a muscle-specific sarcoplasmic reticulum Ca2+ ATPase (SERCA2a) inhibitor, phospholamban, rescued the spectrum of phenotypes that resemble human heart failure. Inhibition of phospholamban-SERCA2a interaction via in vivo expression of a phospholamban point mutant dominantly activated the contractility of ventricular muscle cells. Thus, interfering with phospholamban-SERCA2a interaction may provide a novel therapeutic approach for preventing the progression of dilated cardiomyopathy.

Phospholamban (PLB) inhibits the activity of SERCA2a, the Ca(2+)-ATPase in cardiac sarcoplasmic reticulum, by decreasing the apparent affinity of the enzyme for Ca(2+). Recent cross-linking studies have suggested that PLB binding and Ca(2+) binding to SERCA2a are mutually exclusive. PLB binds to the E2 conformation of the Ca(2+)-ATPase, preventing formation of E1, the conformation that binds two Ca(2+) (at sites I and II) with high affinity and is required for ATP hydrolysis. Here we determined whether Ca(2+) binding to site I, site II, or both sites is sufficient to dissociate PLB from the Ca(2+) pump. Seven SERCA2a mutants with amino acid substitutions at Ca(2+)-binding site I (E770Q, T798A, and E907Q), site II (E309Q and N795A), or both sites (D799N and E309Q/E770Q) were made, and the effects of Ca(2+) on N30C-PLB cross-linking to Lys(328) of SERCA2a were measured. In agreement with earlier reports with the skeletal muscle Ca(2+)-ATPase, none of the SERCA2a mutants (except E907Q) hydrolyzed ATP in the presence of Ca(2+); however, all were phosphorylatable by P(i) to form E2P. Ca(2+) inhibition of E2P formation was observed only in SERCA2a mutants retaining site I. In cross-linking assays, strong cross-linking between N30C-PLB and each Ca(2+)-ATPase mutant was observed in the absence of Ca(2+). Importantly, however, micromolar Ca(2+) inhibited PLB cross-linking only to mutants retaining a functional Ca(2+)-binding site I. The dynamic equilibrium between Ca(2+) pumps and N30C-PLB was retained by all mutants, demonstrating normal regulation of cross-linking by ATP, thapsigargin, and anti-PLB antibody. From these results we conclude that site I is the key Ca(2+)-binding site regulating the physical association between PLB and SERCA2a.

Phospholamban (PLN), the reversible inhibitor of the sarco(endo)plasmic reticulum Ca(2+)-ATPase (SERCA2a), is a key regulator of myocyte Ca(2+) cycling with a significant role in heart failure. We previously showed that the single amino acid difference between human and mouse PLN results in increased inhibition of Ca(2+) cycling and cardiac remodeling and attenuated stress responses in transgenic mice expressing the human PLN (hPLN) in the null background. Here we dissect the molecular and electrophysiological processes triggered by the superinhibitory hPLN in the mouse. Using a multidisciplinary approach, we performed global gene expression analysis, electrophysiology, and mathematical simulations on hPLN mice. We identified significant changes in a series of Na(+) and K(+) homeostasis genes/proteins (including Kcnd2, Scn9a, Slc8a1) and ionic conductance (including L-type Ca(2+) current, Na(+)/Ca(2+) exchanger, transient outward K(+) current). Simulation analysis suggests that this electrical remodeling has a critical role in rescuing cardiac function by improving sarcoplasmic reticulum Ca(2+) load and overall Ca(2+) dynamics. Furthermore, multiple structural and transcription factor gene expression changes indicate an ongoing structural remodeling process, favoring hypertrophy and myogenesis while suppressing apoptosis and progression to heart failure. Our findings expand current understanding of the hPLN function and provide additional insights into the downstream implications of SERCA2a superinhibition in the mammalian heart.

Intracellular calcium is a major coordinator of numerous aspects of cellular physiology, including muscle contractility and cell survival. In cardiac muscle, aberrant Ca(2+) cycling has been implicated in a range of pathological conditions including cardiomyopathies and heart failure. The sarco(endo)plasmic reticulum Ca(2+) transport adenosine triphosphatase (SERCA2a) and its regulator phospholamban (PLN) have a central role in modulating Ca(2+) homeostasis and, therefore, cardiac function. Herein, we discuss the mechanisms through which SERCA2a and PLN control cardiomyocyte function in health and disease. Emphasis is placed on our newly identified PLN-binding partner HS-1-associated protein X-1 (HAX-1), which has an anti-apoptotic function and presents with numerous similarities to Bcl-2. Recent evidence indicates that proteins of the Bcl-2 family can influence ER Ca(2+) content, a critical determinant of cellular sensitivity to apoptosis. The discovery of the PLN/HAX-1 interaction therefore unveils an important new link between Ca(2+) homeostasis and cell survival, with significant therapeutic potential.

Sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR) Ca2+ ATPase (SERCA2a) transports Ca2+ into the SR, decreasing the cytosolic Ca2+ during relaxation and increasing the SR Ca2+ available for contraction. SERCA2a activity is regulated by phosphorylation of another SR protein: Phospholamban (PLN). Dephosphorylated PLN inhibits SERCA2a. Phosphorylation of PLN by either cAMP or cGMP-dependent protein kinase at Ser16 or the Ca2+-calmodulin-dependent protein kinase (CaMKII), at Thr17, relieves this inhibition, increasing SR Ca2+ uptake and SR Ca2+ load. Thus, PLN is a major player in the regulation of myocardial relaxation and contractility. This review will examine the main aspects of the role of CaMKII and Thr17 site of PLN, on different pathophysiological conditions: acidosis, ischemia/reperfusion (I/R) and heart failure (HF). Whereas CaMKII-activation and PLN phosphorylation contribute to the functional recovery during acidosis and stunning, CaMKII results detrimental in the irreversible I/R injury, producing apoptosis and necrosis. Phosphorylation of Thr17 residue of PLN and CaMKII activity vary in the different models of HF. The possible role of these changes in the depressed cardiac function of HF will be discussed.

Phospholamban (PLB) is a major target of the beta-adrenergic cascade in the heart, and functions as an endogenous inhibitor of Ca-ATPase transport activity. To identify whether oligomeric interactions between PLB molecules are involved in regulating Ca-ATPase transport activity, we have investigated functional interactions between PLB and the Ca-ATPase in proteoliposomes of purified PLB functionally co-reconstituted with the SERCA2a isoform of the Ca-ATPase isolated from cardiac sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR). The calcium sensitivity of this reconstituted preparation and functional stimulation by cAMP-dependent protein kinase (PKA) are virtually identical to those of the Ca-ATPase in cardiac SR microsomes, ensuring the functional relevance of this reconstituted preparation. Interactions between PLB molecules were measured following covalent modification of the single lysine (i.e., Lys(3)) in PLB isolated from cardiac SR membranes with fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC) prior to co-reconstitution with the Ca-ATPase. FITC modification of PLB does not interfere with the ability of PLB to inhibit the Ca-ATPase, since FITC-PLB co-reconstituted with the Ca-ATPase exhibits a similar calcium dependence of Ca-ATPase activation to that observed in native SR membranes. Thus, the functional arrangement of PLB with the Ca-ATPase is not modified by FITC modification. Using changes in the anisotropy of FITC-PLB resulting from fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) between proximal PLB molecules to measure the average size and spatial arrangement of FITC chromophores, we find that PLB self-associates to form oligomers whose spatial arrangement with respect to one another is in agreement with earlier suggestions that PLB exists predominantly as a homopentamer. The inability of PKA to activate PLB following covalent modification with FITC permits functional interactions between PLB molecules associated with the Ca-ATPase activation to be identified. A second-order loss of Ca-ATPase activation by PKA is observed as a function of the fractional contribution of FITC-PLB, indicating that PKA-dependent activation of two PLB molecules within a quaternary complex containing the Ca-ATPase is necessary for activation of the Ca-ATPase. We suggest that the requirement for activation of two PLB molecules by PKA represents a physiological mechanism to ensure that activation of the Ca-ATPase following beta-adrenergic stimulation in the heart only occurs above a threshold level of PKA activation.

Myotonic dystrophy (DM) is caused by a CTG expansion in the 3'-untranslated region of a protein kinase gene (DMPK). Cardiovascular disease is one of the most prevalent causes of death in DM patients. Electrophysiological studies in cardiac muscles from DM patients and from DMPK(-/-) mice suggested that DMPK is critical to the modulation of cardiac contractility and to the maintenance of proper cardiac conduction activity. However, there are no data regarding the molecular signaling pathways involved in DM heart failure. Here we show that DMPK expression in cardiac myocytes is highly enriched in the sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR) where it colocalizes with the ryanodine receptor and phospholamban (PLN), a muscle-specific SR Ca(2+)-ATPase (SERCA2a) inhibitor. Coimmunoprecipitation studies showed that DMPK and PLN can physically associate. Furthermore, purified wild-type DMPK, but not a kinase-deficient mutant (K110A DMPK), phosphorylates PLN in vitro. Subsequent studies using the DMPK(-/-) mice demonstrated that PLN is hypo-phosphorylated in SR vesicles from DMPK(-/-) mice compared with wild-type mice both in vitro and in vivo. Finally, we show that Ca(2+) uptake in SR is impaired in ventricular homogenates from DMPK(-/-) mice. Together, our data suggest the existence of a novel regulatory DMPK pathway for cardiac contractility and provide a molecular mechanism for DM heart pathology.
