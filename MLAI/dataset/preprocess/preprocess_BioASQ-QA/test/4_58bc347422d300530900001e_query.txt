How many microorganisms are present in human normal gut?

Social behavior plays a pivotal role in the mental well-being of an individual. Continuous efforts in the past have led to advancements in the area of how the brain regulates emotion and cognition, while the understanding of human social behavior still remains eluded. A major breakthrough in understanding the etiology of neurological disorders is the recent insight on the role of the gut microbiota (GM). Human GM also referred to as the "forgotten organ" is home to 10(13-14) microorganisms, which is 10 times the number of cells present in the human body. In addition, the gut microbiome (total genome of GM) is 150 times greater as compared to the human genome. An emerging concept gaining worldwide focus and acceptance is that, this much big genome can potentially control human behavior and other biological functions. Herein we hypothesize on the basis of GM's ability to modify brain and behavior and that it can directly or indirectly control social behavior. This review focuses on the association of GM with various domains of social behavior like stress, cognition and anxiety.

Type 1 diabetes (T1D) is an autoimmune disease resulting from T cell-mediated destruction of the insulin-secreting pancreatic beta cells. During the past 50 years T1D incidence has increased dramatically in many countries accompanied by an earlier age of onset especially in persons with lower genetic risk. These observations have prompted investigations of dynamic environmental factors that may contributor to risk for anti-pancreatic immunity. The gut and pancreas are anatomically and biochemically linked through the enteroinsular axis, a system in which gut-derived immune and metabolic signals have the potential to evoke effects in the pancreas. The gut microbiome (i.e. the 100 trillion symbiotic microorganisms which inhabit the mammalian gastrointestinal tract) influences numerous aspects of host metabolism, development and immunity. Here we examine recent evidence linking gut microbiome composition and function to pancreatic autoimmunity. Studies in children with genetic risk factors for T1D and analyses of the microbiome in rodent models have begun to associations between an altered microbiome composition potentially favoring a pro-inflammatory intestinal metabolic milieu and T1D. We discuss how environmental factors during critical developmental windows - gestation, birth, weaning and puberty may contribute to T1D risk. For example mode of delivery (vaginal or C-section) and exposure to antibiotics (pre- or post-natally) are two factors that modulate the maternal and/or offspring microbiome and can impact T1D development. Taken together, these emerging data underscore the requirement for longitudinal studies and mechanistic investigations in human subjects and rodent models to identify the basis for microbiome modulation of T1D and to identify biomarkers and therapeutics to improve the delayed onset and prevention of the disease.

The gut microbiome comprises the collective genome of the trillions of microorganisms residing in our gastrointestinal ecosystem. The interaction between the host and its gut microbiome is a complex relationship whose manipulation could prove critical to preventing or treating not only various gut disorders, like irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) and ulcerative colitis (UC), but also central nervous system (CNS) disorders, such as Alzheimer's and Parkinson's diseases. The purpose of this review is to summarize what is known about the gut microbiome, how it is connected to the development of disease and to identify the bacterial and biochemical targets that should be the focus of future research. Understanding the mechanisms behind the activity and proliferation of the gut microbiome will provide us new insights that may pave the way for novel therapeutic strategies.

The microorganisms inhabiting the human gut are abundant (10(14) cells) and diverse (approximately 500 species per individual). It is now acknowledged that the microbiota has coevolved with its host to achieve a symbiotic relationship, leading to physiological homeostasis. The gut microbiota ensures vital functions, such as food digestibility, maturation of the host immune system, and protection against pathogens. Over the last few decades, the gut microbiota has also been associated with numerous diseases, such as inflammatory bowel disease, irritable bowel syndrome, obesity, and metabolic diseases. In most of these pathologies, a microbial dysbiosis has been found, indicating shifts in the taxonomic composition of the gut microbiota and changes in its functionality. Our understanding of the influence of the gut microbiota on human health is still growing. Working with microorganisms residing in the gut is challenging since most of them are anaerobic and a vast majority (approximately 75%) are uncultivable to date. Recently, a wide range of new approaches (meta-omics) has been developed to bypass the uncultivability and reveal the intricate mechanisms that sustain gut microbial homeostasis. After a brief description of these approaches (metagenomics, metatranscriptomics, metaproteomics, and metabolomics), this review will discuss the importance of considering the gut microbiome as a structured ecosystem and the use of meta-omics to decipher dysfunctions of the gut microbiome in diseases.
