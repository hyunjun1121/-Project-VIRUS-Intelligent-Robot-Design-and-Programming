Which bacteria caused plague?

Protein tyrosine phosphatases (PTPases) and kinases coregulate the critical levels of phosphorylation necessary for intracellular signalling, cell growth and differentiation. Yersinia, the causative bacteria of the bubonic plague and other enteric diseases, secrete an active PTPase, Yop51, that enters and suppresses host immune cells. Though the catalytic domain is only approximately 20% identical to human PTP1B, the Yersinia PTPase contains all of the invariant residues present in eukaryotic PTPases, including the nucleophilic Cys 403 which forms a phosphocysteine intermediate during catalysis. We present here structures of the unliganded (2.5 A resolution) and tungstate-bound (2.6 A) crystal forms which reveal that Cys 403 is positioned at the centre of a distinctive phosphate-binding loop. This loop is at the hub of several hydrogen-bond arrays that not only stabilize a bound oxyanion, but may activate Cys 403 as a reactive thiolate. Binding of tungstate triggers a conformational change that traps the oxyanion and swings Asp 356, an important catalytic residue, by approximately 6 A into the active site. The same anion-binding loop in PTPases is also found in the enzyme rhodanese.

Plague is still an endemic disease in different regions of the world. Increasing reports of incidence, the discovery of antibiotic resistance strains, and concern about a potential use of the causative bacteria Yersinia pestis as an agent of biological warfare have highlighted the need for a safe, efficacious, and rapidly producible vaccine. The use of F1 and V antigens and the derived protein fusion F1-V has shown great potential as a protective vaccine in animal studies. Plants have been extensively studied for the production of pharmaceutical proteins as an inexpensive and scalable alternative to common expression systems. In the current study the recombinant plague antigens F1, V, and fusion protein F1-V were produced by transient expression in Nicotiana benthamiana by using a deconstructed tobacco mosaic virus-based system that allowed very rapid and extremely high levels of expression. All of the plant-derived purified antigens, administered s.c. to guinea pigs, generated systemic immune responses and provided protection against an aerosol challenge of virulent Y. pestis.
