What class of drugs frequently has muscle pain and other muscle toxicities such as mysositis and rhabdomyolysis as a side effect?

[PMID: 17143099]
Lipid-lowering drugs are associated with myotoxicity, which ranges in severity from myalgias to rhabdomyolysis resulting in renal failure and death. Although rhabdomyolysis is rare, muscle symptoms and serum creatine kinase elevations are sufficiently frequent during the course of lipid-lowering drug therapy to pose diagnostic challenges for the clinician. Progress in our understanding of this form of myotoxicity is reviewed. Muscle pain and weakness are the cardinal symptoms and often interfere with vigorous exercise. These symptoms may occur with or without serum creatine kinase elevations. The risk of myotoxicity is increased by combination statin-fibrate therapy as well as by factors that elevate tissue levels of the lipid-lowering drug, including the dose, drug-drug interactions, and host factors. Underlying neuromuscular diseases may become clinically apparent during statin therapy and may predispose to myotoxicity. The pathophysiology of myotoxicity most probably involves metabolic effects of the statins on the isoprenoid pool and on mitochondrial function. Management of myotoxicity requires an evaluation of risk factors prior to prescribing lipid-lowering drugs, attention to muscle symptoms, and withdrawal of drug in the event of significant abnormalities.

The 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase inhibitors, or statins, are important drugs used in the treatment and prevention of cardiovascular disease. Although statins are well tolerated, many patients develop myopathy manifesting as muscle aches and pain. Rhabdomyolysis is a rare but severe toxicity of statins. Interindividual differences in the activities of hepatic membrane drug transporters and metabolic enzymes are known to influence statin plasma pharmacokinetics and risk for myopathy. Interestingly, little is known regarding the molecular determinants of statin distribution into skeletal muscle and its relevance to toxicity. We sought to identify statin transporters in human skeletal muscle and determine their impact on statin toxicity in vitro. We demonstrate that the uptake transporter OATP2B1 (human organic anion transporting polypeptide 2B1) and the efflux transporters, multidrug resistance-associated protein (MRP)1, MRP4, and MRP5 are expressed on the sarcolemmal membrane of human skeletal muscle fibers and that atorvastatin and rosuvastatin are substrates of these transporters when assessed using a heterologous expression system. In an in vitro model of differentiated, primary human skeletal muscle myoblast cells, we demonstrate basal membrane expression and drug efflux activity of MRP1, which contributes to reducing intracellular statin accumulation. Furthermore, we show that expression of human OATP2B1 in human skeletal muscle myoblast cells by adenoviral vectors increases intracellular accumulation and toxicity of statins and such effects were abrogated when cells overexpressed MRP1. These results identify key membrane transporters as modulators of skeletal muscle statin exposure and toxicity.

Lipid lowering drugs, such as statins, are commonly used to treat approximately 10 million Canadians affected by hypercholesterolemia. The most commonly experienced side-effect of statin medication is muscle pain. Statin induced myopathy consists of a spectrum of myopathic disorders ranging from mild myalgia to fatal rhabdomyolysis. The following is a presentation of 2 cases of statin induced myopathy in patients presenting in a chiropractic setting. In addition, discussion will surround the mechanism, predisposing risk factors and frequency of statin induced myopathy while highlighting the role that chiropractors and other manual therapists may play in its recognition and management.

Muscular complaints are known side-effects of statin therapy, ranging from myalgia to clinically important myositis and rhabdomyolysis. We investigated the statin use and association with the presence and characteristics of muscular complaints. We conducted a prospective observational study in internal medicine departments. Patients with statin therapy before hospitalization were interviewed for muscular complaints. When muscular complaints were reported, information on type and severity of muscular symptoms, location and time to onset was collected. We identified 85 patients with statin treatment at hospital admission out of 521 included. Nine (10.59%) patients reported muscular complaints associated with statin therapy. A cluster of symptoms (cramps, stiffness, decreased muscle power) was reported, affecting both upper and lower limbs. The severity of pain was in most of the cases moderate or severe. All patients reported that pain was intermittent. Five reported that pain was generalized. Symptoms appeared in the first month of treatment or three months after the drug initiation. Creatine kinase was raised in one patient. In two cases drug interactions were probably responsible for muscular complaints. In the studied set of patients muscular symptoms were a rather frequent effect of statin therapy. As this side-effect could be troublesome for patients and could lead to more severe outcomes, their timely detection and management is important.

3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase reductase inhibitors (statins) are generally well tolerated, with statin-associated muscle symptoms (SAMS) the most common side effect (~10%) seen in statin users. However, studies and clinical observations indicate that many of the self-reported SAMS appear to be nonspecific (ie, potentially not attributable to statins). Mental health and well-being influence self-perception of pain, so we sought to assess the effect of baseline well-being and depression on the development of muscle pain with 6 months of atorvastatin 80 mg/d (ATORVA) or placebo in healthy, statin-naive adults. The Psychological General Well-being Index (n = 83) and Beck Depression Inventory (n = 55) questionnaires were administered at baseline in participants (aged 59.5 ± 1.2 years) from the effect of Statins on Skeletal Muscle Function and Performance (STOMP) trial (NCT00609063). Muscle pain (Short-Form McGill Pain Questionnaire [SF-MPQ]), pain that interferes with daily life (Brief Pain Inventory [BPI]), and pain severity (BPI) were then measured before, throughout, and after treatment. At baseline, there were no differences in well-being (Psychological General Well-being Index), depression (Beck Depression Inventory), or pain measures (SF-MPQ and BPI) (P values ≥ .05) between the placebo and ATORVA groups. Baseline well-being correlated negatively with baseline BPI pain severity (r = -0.290, P = .008). Baseline depression correlated with baseline pain (SF-MPQ; r = 0.314, P = .020). Baseline well-being and depression did not predict the change in pain severity or interference after 6 months among the total sample or between groups (P values ≥ .05). Baseline well-being and depression were not significant predictors of pain after 6 months of ATORVA (P values ≥ .05). Thus, they do not appear to increase the risk of SAMS in otherwise healthy adults.

Statins are the primary class of medication used to lower serum cholesterol concentration for both primary and secondary prevention of cardiovascular disease. Muscle pain is a frequent adverse effect of statins. Severe myonecrosis leading to clinical rhabdomyolysis is rare. We encountered a 63-year-old male with a medical history of hypertension, type 2 diabetes mellitus, and coronary artery disease with angioplasty in 2008 and 2020. He was started on rosuvastatin 40 mg (0-0-1) along with dual anti-platelets post angioplasty and was discharged home. He traveled back to his hometown and noticed progressive symmetric muscle weakness with decreased urine output. After visiting another hospital he presented to us with severe proximal muscle weakness and acute renal failure. Laboratory investigations were initiated which demonstrated clinically significant derangement in serum creatinine phosphokinase, serum creatinine, urine myoglobin along with deranged liver enzymes. He was subjected to nerve conduction studies for his muscle weakness which was normal and electromyography showed abnormal spontaneous muscle activity in all examined muscles (fibrillations, positive sharp waves, and pseudomyotonic discharges) suggestive of an irritable myopathy. The medication was stopped and he was treated with eight cycles of hemodialysis until his muscle weakness and laboratory parameters improved. He was then discharged with some improvement in muscle weakness. On two week follow-up, the patient showed partial improvement after discontinuation of all lipid-lowering medication.

Statin use is associated with a variety of overtly related muscle symptoms including muscle pain, myalgia, creatine kinase elevations without pain with myolysis and myositis (rhabdomyolysis), a potentially fatal side effect that led to the withdrawal of cerivastatin in 2001. Unintended drug response phenotypes have an impact on patient compliance and sometimes patient health and the assessment of risk on an individual basis could enhance therapeutic benefit. We therefore investigated whether common single nucleotide polymorphisms were associated with the expression of broadly grouped atorvastatin-induced muscle events in a case-control study (n=263 samples, n=388 SNPs). Of a number of associations identified in a discovery sample (51 atorvastatin-induced muscle and 55 normal) only those corresponding to the CYP2D6*4 allele were significantly associated in the sample (24 atorvastatin-induced muscle and 133 normal) (Discovery P=0.004, odds ratio=3.6; Validation P=0.036, odds ratio=2.7; total P=0.001, odds ratio=2.5). The frequency of the CYP2D6*4 allele was about 50% in atorvastatin-induced muscle patients but only 28% in controls, similar to that of other patient types (28.5%). The association was independent of various demographic variables and not explained by gross demographic, clinical or population-structure differences among cases and controls. Surprisingly, the CYP2D6*4 allele appeared similarly distributed among controls and patients expressing simvastatin-induced muscle events (n=169, frequency in case participants=49.2%, P=0.067, odds ratio=1.7). Our results suggest that the CYP2D6*4 allele is associated with broadly related muscle events caused by at least two structurally dissimilar HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors, and as such, may have implications for a better understanding of this statin-wide phenomena.

We report a patient with renal insufficiency who developed rhabdomyolysis 1 month after initiating cerivastatin and gemfibrozil for hyperlipidemia. Myopathy caused by HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors (statins) alone is rare, but occurs more frequently when a statin is used with gemfibrozil, a medication that likely has a direct toxic effect on muscles. Predisposing factors to the development of myopathy from the combination include use of medications affecting statin metabolism, higher doses of statins, renal insufficiency, diuretics, and hypothyroidism. It has been proposed that alternate-day therapy with a statin and fibrate, spacing of doses in a single day, or use of lower doses of statins may prevent the development of myopathy. Currently, no predictable method to determine who is at risk for myopathy exists, nor is there a reliable screening test. Therefore, patients should be advised to watch for generalized muscle pain or weakness, and if it occurs, stop medications and report symptoms immediately.

Muscular side effects of various anesthetics, analgetics, antibiotics, antihistaminic drugs, antiretrovirals, cardiotropics, immunosuppressants, lipid-lowering drugs, psychotropic drugs, anticancer drugs, and other substances are more frequent than assumed and are easily overlooked. Clinically, muscular side effects manifest as fatigue, myalgias, persistent or transient weakness, stiffness, intolerance to exercise, psychomotor slowing, muscle cramps, wasting, dyspnea, dysphagia, fasciculations, reduced tendon reflexes, impaired consciousness, myoglobinuria, renal failure, or hyperthermia. Diagnosis of these drug-induced myopathies is based on history, clinical neurologic examination, blood work, urine analysis, repetitive stimulation, electromyography, and muscle biopsy. A drug which induces muscular side effects should never be given again. Particularly in patients suffering from primary myopathy, myotoxic drugs should be applied with caution. The drugs which most frequently induce muscular side effects are steroids, statins, fibrates, antiretrovirals, immunosuppressants, colchicine, amiodarone, and anticancer drugs. Many drugs exhibit their myotoxic potential only in combination with other drugs or premorbid pathologic myogenic conditions.

Myopathy is usually a non-fatal muscle disease involving skeletal muscle weakness, tenderness and pain with the possibility of the plasma creatinine kinase elevation. There are many different types of myopathies, some of which are genetic, inflammatory, or related to endocrine dysfunction. Also, numerous drugs have been reported to possess myotoxic effect. Myopathy is included among the potential side-effects and toxicities associated with the lipid lowering agents, particularly 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A (HMG-CoA) reductase inhibitors. However, the precise mechanism of statin-induced muscle toxicity remains unclear. The muscle-related side-effects reported with lipid-lowering drugs are significant but quite rare (0.1%), when used in monotherapy; while the incidence of steroid-induced myopathy has varied from 7 to 60%% and chronic alcoholic myopathy seems to be common complication of alcoholism affecting approximately 50% of patients, respectively. This review focuses on the differential pathophysiological grounds of these muscular injuries induced by statins, fibrates, as well as some other agents: corticosteroids or alcohol. A wide spectrum of possible mechanisms and hypotheses including muscle enzyme defects, changes in mitochondrial function and intracellular metabolism, the influence on the cell membrane stability and drug interactions involving P-glycoprotein or cytochrome P 450 system have been presented.

Drug-induced myopathy and rhabdomyolysis are rare adverse drug reactions (ADR). They have been seen after the introduction of modern lipid-lowering drugs more regularly. The first description after medication with clofibrate dates back to 1968. Apparently, all fibrates can induce myopathy. It usually starts after a few days of medication, or after prolonged use, showing muscle weakness and/or pain. Concomitantly, the enzyme creatininephosphokinase (CPK) is raised dramatically. Muscular necrosis can follow leading secondarily to kidney failure, and eventually to death. For the class of statins, myopathy was more often seen after their introduction, and it became their most feared adverse effect, especially in combination of statins with other drugs (mibefradil, gemfibrozil, cyclosporin). In animal models the evolution of the disease and the mechanism of action may be elucidated. Though strong epidemiological data are lacking, the incidence of myopathy is probably similar for all lipid-lowering drugs and is in the range of 0.1-0.5% with monotherapy, increasing to 0.5-2.5% with combination therapy. Severe cases of rhabdomyolysis are rarer, but may have a significant mortality. The market success of cerivastatin within a short period has led to 100s of myopathies and some dozens of deaths. Though interactions on metabolism and ensuing high plasma levels can partially explain myopathy as intoxication, there are strong indications that other (endocrine, metabolic, genetic) factors might play a role in the pathophysiology. The patient population at risk should better be defined and withheld from myopathy-inducing drugs.

Elevated total cholesterol (total-C) and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) levels are established risk factors for cardiovascular disease (CVD). HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors (statins) are effective cholesterol-lowering drugs that are commonly prescribed to treat this condition. These drugs are often combined with another class of drugs, fibric acid derivatives, to lower both cholesterol and triglyceride levels. Rhabdomyolysis is a known, rare serious side effect of statin monotherapy and of statin-fibrate combination therapy. To examine Food and Drug Administration's (FDA's) postmarketing database for cases of rhabdomyolysis in relation to monotherapy and combination use and calculate reporting rates for this event. Domestic cases of statin- and statin/gemfibrozil-associated rhabdomyolysis were culled from FDA's database and reviewed. Rhabdomyolysis was defined by CPK > or = 10,000 IU/L, myopathic signs and symptoms and clinical diagnosis of rhabdomyolysis. Reporting rates, consisting of number of reported cases/number of prescriptions for each drug, were then calculated to determine whether the reporting of rhabdomyolysis cases was commensurate with extent of use of each statin in the population. Cases were obtained from the FDA adverse event reporting system (AERS) database. NA. Number of rhabdomyolysis cases were evaluated, along with outcomes, such as renal failure, dialysis and death. Of 866 total reported cases, 482 (56%) were associated with monotherapy and 384 (44%) related to combination therapy. More than 80% of reported cases for each drug resulted in hospitalization for renal failure and dialysis. 80 patients expired from events related directly to rhabdomyolysis. Reporting rates for all statins, except for cerivastatin, were similar and much lower than 1 per 100,000 prescriptions. The cerivastatin-reporting rate was much higher at 4.24/100,000 prescriptions. Rhabdomyolysis is a rare, serious side effect of statin monotherapy and of statin-fibrate combination therapy. Clinicians need to remain cognizant of this potential adverse event and discuss signs and symptoms of muscle toxicity with patients in order improve the benefits-to-risks of treating dyslipidemia with statins.
