What is the function of the protein SLC26A5?

[PMID: 34294052]
Prestin (SLC26A5) is responsible for acute sensitivity and frequency selectivity in the vertebrate auditory system. Limited knowledge of prestin is from experiments using site-directed mutagenesis or domain-swapping techniques after the amino acid residues were identified by comparing the sequence of prestin to those of its paralogs and orthologs. Frog prestin is the only representative in amphibian lineage and the studies of it were quite rare with only one species identified. Here we report a new coding sequence of SLC26A5 for a frog species, Rana catesbeiana (the American bullfrog). In our study, the SLC26A5 gene of Rana has been mapped, sequenced and cloned successively using RNA-Seq. We measured the nonlinear capacitance (NLC) of prestin both in the hair cells of Rana's inner ear and HEK293T cells transfected with this new coding gene. HEK293T cells expressing Rana prestin showed electrophysiological features similar to that of hair cells from its inner ear. Comparative studies of zebrafish, chick, Rana and an ancient frog species showed that chick and zebrafish prestin lacked NLC. Ancient frog's prestin was functionally different from Rana. We mapped and sequenced the SLC26A5 of the Rana catesbeiana from its inner ear cDNA using RNA-Seq. The Rana SLC26A5 cDNA was 2292 bp long, encoding a polypeptide of 763 amino acid residues, with 40% identity to mammals. This new coding gene could encode a functionally active protein conferring NLC to both frog HCs and the mammalian cell line. While comparing to its orthologs, the amphibian prestin has been evolutionarily changing its function and becomes more advanced than avian and teleost prestin.

SLC26A5 transporter prestin is fundamental for the higher hearing sensitivity and frequency selectivity of mammals. Prestin is a voltage-dependent transporter found in the cochlear outer hair cells responsible for their electromotility. Intracellular chloride binding is considered essential for voltage sensitivity and electromotility. Prestin is composed by a transmembrane domain and by a cytosolic domain called STAS. There is evidence of a calcium/calmodulin regulation of prestin mediated by the STAS domain. Using different biophysical techniques, namely SEC, CD, ITC, MST, NMR and SAXS, here we demonstrate and characterize the direct interaction between calmodulin and prestin STAS. We show that the interaction is calcium-dependent and that involves residues at the N-terminal end of the "variable loop". This is an intrinsically disordered insertion typical of the STAS domains of the SLC26 family of transporters whose function is still unclear. We derive a low-resolution model of the STAS/CaM complex, where only one lobe of calmodulin is engaged in the interaction, and build a model for the entire dimeric prestin in complex with CaM, which can use the unoccupied lobe to interact with other regions of prestin or with other regulatory proteins. We show that also a non-mammalian STAS can interact with calmodulin via the variable loop. These data start to shed light on the regulatory role of the STAS variable loop of prestin.

Cardiac cells generate and amplify force in the context of cardiac load, yet the membranous sheath enclosing the muscle fibers-the sarcolemma-does not experience displacement. That the sarcolemma sustains beat-to-beat pressure changes without experiencing significant distortion is a muscle-contraction paradox. Here, we report that an elastic element-the motor protein prestin (Slc26a5)-serves to amplify actin-myosin force generation in mouse and human cardiac myocytes, accounting partly for the nonlinear capacitance of cardiomyocytes. The functional significance of prestin is underpinned by significant alterations of cardiac contractility in Prestin-knockout mice. Prestin was previously considered exclusive to the inner ear's outer hair cells; however, our results show that prestin serves a broader cellular motor function.

The outer hair cell (OHC) membrane harbors a voltage-dependent protein, prestin (SLC26a5), in high density, whose charge movement is evidenced as a nonlinear capacitance (NLC). NLC is bell-shaped, with its peak occurring at a voltage, V<sub>h</sub>, where sensor charge is equally distributed across the plasma membrane. Thus, V<sub>h</sub> provides information on the conformational state of prestin. V<sub>h</sub> is sensitive to membrane tension, shifting to positive voltage as tension increases and is the basis for considering prestin piezoelectric (PZE). NLC can be deconstructed into real and imaginary components that report on charge movements in phase or 90 degrees out of phase with AC voltage. Here we show in membrane macro-patches of the OHC that there is a partial trade-off in the magnitude of real and imaginary components as interrogation frequency increases, as predicted by a recent PZE model (Rabbitt in Proc Natl Acad Sci USA 17:21880-21888, 2020). However, we find similar behavior in a simple 2-state voltage-dependent kinetic model of prestin that lacks piezoelectric coupling. At a particular frequency, F<sub>is</sub>, the complex component magnitudes intersect. Using this metric, F<sub>is</sub>, which depends on the frequency response of each complex component, we find that initial V<sub>h</sub> influences F<sub>is</sub>; thus, by categorizing patches into groups of different V<sub>h</sub>, (above and below - 30 mV) we find that F<sub>is</sub> is lower for the negative V<sub>h</sub> group. We also find that the effect of membrane tension on complex NLC is dependent, but differentially so, on initial V<sub>h</sub>. Whereas the negative group exhibits shifts to higher frequencies for increasing tension, the opposite occurs for the positive group. Despite complex component trade-offs, the low-pass roll-off in absolute magnitude of NLC, which varies little with our perturbations and is indicative of diminishing total charge movement, poses a challenge for a role of voltage-driven prestin in cochlear amplification at very high frequencies.

The voltage-dependent motor protein prestin (also known as SLC26A5) is responsible for the electromotive behaviour of outer-hair cells and underlies the cochlear amplifier<sup>1</sup>. Knockout or impairment of prestin causes severe hearing loss<sup>2-5</sup>. Despite the key role of prestin in hearing, the mechanism by which mammalian prestin senses voltage and transduces it into cellular-scale movements (electromotility) is poorly understood. Here we determined the structure of dolphin prestin in six distinct states using single-particle cryo-electron microscopy. Our structural and functional data suggest that prestin adopts a unique and complex set of states, tunable by the identity of bound anions (Cl<sup>-</sup> or SO<sub>4</sub><sup>2-</sup>). Salicylate, a drug that can cause reversible hearing loss, competes for the anion-binding site of prestin, and inhibits its function by immobilizing prestin in a new conformation. Our data suggest that the bound anion together with its coordinating charged residues and helical dipole act as a dynamic voltage sensor. An analysis of all of the anion-dependent conformations reveals how structural rearrangements in the voltage sensor are coupled to conformational transitions at the protein-membrane interface, suggesting a previously undescribed mechanism of area expansion. Visualization of the electromotility cycle of prestin distinguishes the protein from the closely related SLC26 anion transporters, highlighting the basis for evolutionary specialization of the mammalian cochlear amplifier at a high resolution.
