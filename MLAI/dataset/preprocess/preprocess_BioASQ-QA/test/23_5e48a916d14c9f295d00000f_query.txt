A novel series of alkoxyimino derivatives as S1P1 agonists were discovered through de novo design using FTY720 as the chemical starting point. Extensive structure-activity relationship studies led to the discovery of (E)-1-(4-(1-(((4-cyclohexyl-3-(trifluoromethyl)benzyl)oxy)imino)ethyl)-2-ethylbenzyl)azetidine-3-carboxylic acid (32, BAF312, Siponimod), which has recently completed phase 2 clinical trials in patients with relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis.

Multiple sclerosis (MS) is an immune-mediated disorder that affects the central nervous system (CNS), often first affecting people in early adulthood. Although most MS patients have a relapsing-remitting course (RRMS) at disease onset, a substantial proportion later develop chronic progression, termed secondary progressive MS (SPMS). Approximately 10% of MS patients experience chronic progression from disease onset, termed primary progressive multiple sclerosis (PPMS). Although several disease-modifying treatment (DMT) options exist for relapsing forms of this disease, DMT options are few for progressive MS (PPMS and SPMS). Herein, we strive to define progressive MS, review major clinical trials aimed at progressive MS, and delineate potential strategies in the management of progressive MS. In 2017, the first DMT for PPMS, the B lymphocyte-depleting monoclonal antibody, ocrelizumab, came to market. Ocrelizumab reduced 12-week confirmed disability progression (CDP) by 24% versus placebo. Siponimod, a selective sphingosine-1-phosphate receptor modulator, reduced 3-month CDP by 21% versus placebo in SPMS. Ibudilast slowed brain atrophy in PPMS and SPMS patients in a multicenter phase 2b study. Smaller early phase studies of alpha-lipoic acid and simvastatin each found slowing of rate of whole brain atrophy in SPMS patients. Reasons now exist for optimism in the search for DMTs for progressive MS. It remains a challenge to identify outcome measures that accurately reflect the underlying pathology in progressive MS, which is less inflammatory and more degenerative than RRMS.

Development of sphingosine-1-phosphate receptor 1 (S1P1) modulators to dampen inflammation and its sequelae is becoming increasingly promising for treating medical conditions characterized by significant immunopathology. As shown by the non-selective S1P receptor modulator FTY720 (fingolimod [Gilenya(®)]) in the treatment of relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis (MS), the ability to use S1P1 modulation to precisely block immune cell traffic-immunomodulation-while maintaining immunosurveillance, has opened therapeutic opportunities in various other immune-derived chronic pathologies, including inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), lupus, psoriasis, as well as, potentially, in early acute viral respiratory infection. Proof-of-concept studies across validated animal models with S1P receptor modulators highly selective for S1P1, such as BAF-312 (Siponimod), KRP-203, ONO-4641 (Ceralifimod), ponesimod and RPC-1063, and emerging clinical trials for safety and efficacy in humans, particularly in MS, ulcerative colitis (UC) and psoriasis, have set the stage for us to consider additional testing in various other autoimmune diseases.

Multiple sclerosis treatment faces tremendous changes owing to the approval of new medications, some of which are available as oral formulations. Until now, the four orally available medications, fingolimod, dimethylfumarate (BG-12), teriflunomide, and cladribine have received market authorization, whereas laquinimod is still under development. Fingolimod is a sphingosine-1-phosphate inhibitor, which is typically used as escalation therapy and leads to up to 60% reduction of the annualized relapse rate, but might also have neuroprotective properties. In addition, there are three more specific S1P agonists in late stages of development: siponimod, ponesimod, and ozanimod. Dimethylfumarate has immunomodulatory and cytoprotective functions and is used as baseline therapy. Teriflunomide, the active metabolite of the rheumatoid arthritis medication leflunomide, targets the dihydroorotate dehydrogenase, thus inhibiting the proliferation of lymphocytes by depletion of pyrimidines. Here we will review the mechanisms of action, clinical trial data, as well as data about safety and tolerability of the compounds.

Background and Purpose- Perihemorrhagic edema (PHE) is associated with poor outcome after intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH). Infiltration of immune cells is considered a major contributor of PHE. Recent studies suggest that immunomodulation via S1PR (sphingosine-1-phosphate receptor) modulators improve outcome in ICH. Siponimod, a selective modulator of sphingosine 1-phosphate receptors type 1 and type 5, demonstrated an excellent safety profile in a large study of patients with multiple sclerosis. Here, we investigated the impact of siponimod treatment on perihemorrhagic edema, neurological deficits, and survival in a mouse model of ICH. Methods- ICH was induced by intracranial injection of 0.075 U of bacterial collagenase in 123 mice. Mice were randomly assigned to different treatment groups: vehicle, siponimod given as a single dosage 30 minutes after the operation or given 3× for 3 consecutive days starting 30 minutes after operation. The primary outcome of our study was evolution of PHE measured by magnetic resonance-imaging on T2-maps 72 hours after ICH, secondary outcomes included evolution of PHE 24 hours after ICH, survival and neurological deficits, as well as effects on circulating blood cells and body weight. Results- Siponimod significantly reduced PHE measured by magnetic resonance imaging (<i>P</i>=0.021) as well as wet-dry method (<i>P</i>=0.04) 72 hours after ICH. Evaluation of PHE 24 hours after ICH showed a tendency toward attenuated brain edema in the low-dosage group (<i>P</i>=0.08). Multiple treatments with siponimod significantly improved neurological deficits measured by Garcia Score (<i>P</i>=0.03). Survival at day 10 was improved in mice treated with multiple dosages of siponimod (<i>P</i>=0.037). Mice treated with siponimod showed a reduced weight loss after ICH (<i>P</i>=0.036). Conclusions- Siponimod (BAF-312) attenuated PHE after ICH, increased survival, and reduced ICH-induced sensorimotor deficits in our experimental ICH-model. Findings encourage further investigation of inflammatory modulators as well as the translation of BAF-312 to a human study of ICH patients.

Sphingosine 1-phosphate (S1P<sub>1</sub> ) modulators provide an emerging therapeutic approach for various autoimmune disorders such as multiple sclerosis and psoriasis. Fingolimod is the first approved orally active, selective and potent drug of this class. Other drugs belonging to this class include siponimod, ponesimod, ceralifimod, amiselimod, CS-0777 and GSK2018682. However, owing to the high protein binding, polarity and zwitter-ionic nature of the phosphate metabolite of parent drugs, it becomes challenging to optimize the extraction method for this class of compounds. Although, there are individual published bioanalytical methods for the analysis of selected S1P<sub>1</sub> modulators to support preclinical and clinical drug development, no extensive review compiling all the bioanalytical methods for the important drugs in the class is available. Thus, we attempted to prepare a comprehensive review on various bioanalytical methods for selected S1P<sub>1</sub> modulators which will provide all the relevant bioanalytical information as required by bioanalytical researchers. This review focuses on the various liquid chromatography with tandem mass spectrometry methods that have been used to quantify S1P<sub>1</sub> modulators in various biological matrices. Extraction methods included liquid-liquid extraction, solid-phase extraction and one-step protein precipitation for extracting the analytes. This review captures key information regarding sample processing options and chromatographic/detection conditions.

No treatment has consistently shown efficacy in slowing disability progression in patients with secondary progressive multiple sclerosis (SPMS). We assessed the effect of siponimod, a selective sphingosine 1-phosphate (S1P) receptor<sub>1,5</sub> modulator, on disability progression in patients with SPMS. This event-driven and exposure-driven, double-blind, phase 3 trial was done at 292 hospital clinics and specialised multiple sclerosis centres in 31 countries. Using interactive response technology to assign numbers linked to treatment arms, patients (age 18-60 years) with SPMS and an Expanded Disability Status Scale score of 3·0-6·5 were randomly assigned (2:1) to once daily oral siponimod 2 mg or placebo for up to 3 years or until the occurrence of a prespecified number of confirmed disability progression (CDP) events. The primary endpoint was time to 3-month CDP. Efficacy was assessed for the full analysis set (ie, all randomly assigned and treated patients); safety was assessed for the safety set. This trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT01665144. 1651 patients were randomly assigned between Feb 5, 2013, and June 2, 2015 (1105 to the siponimod group, and 546 to the placebo group). One patient did not sign the consent form, and five patients did not receive study drug, all of whom were in the siponimod group. 1645 patients were included in the analyses (1099 in the siponimod group and 546 in the placebo). At baseline, the mean time since first multiple sclerosis symptoms was 16·8 years (SD 8·3), and the mean time since conversion to SPMS was 3·8 years (SD 3·5); 1055 (64%) patients had not relapsed in the previous 2 years, and 918 (56%) of 1651 needed walking assistance. 903 (82%) patients receiving siponimod and 424 (78%) patients receiving placebo completed the study. 288 (26%) of 1096 patients receiving siponimod and 173 (32%) of 545 patients receiving placebo had 3-month CDP (hazard ratio 0·79, 95% CI 0·65-0·95; relative risk reduction 21%; p=0·013). Adverse events occurred in 975 (89%) of 1099 patients receiving siponimod versus 445 (82%) of 546 patients receiving placebo; serious adverse events were reported for 197 (18%) patients in the siponimod group versus 83 (15%) patients in the placebo group. Lymphopenia, increased liver transaminase concentration, bradycardia and bradyarrhythmia at treatment initiation, macular oedema, hypertension, varicella zoster reactivation, and convulsions occurred more frequently with siponimod than with placebo. Initial dose titration mitigated cardiac first-dose effects. Frequencies of infections, malignancies, and fatalities did not differ between groups. Siponimod reduced the risk of disability progression with a safety profile similar to that of other S1P modulators and is likely to be a useful treatment for SPMS. Novartis Pharma AG.

<b>Introduction</b>: Multiple sclerosis (MS) causes focal lesions of immune-mediated demyelinating events followed by slow progressive accumulation of disability. Over the past 2 decades, multiple medications have been studied and approved for use in MS. Most of these agents work by modulating or suppressing the peripheral immune system. Siponimod is a newer-generation sphingosine 1 phosphate (S1P) receptor modulator that internalizes S1P1 receptors, thereby inhibiting efflux of lymphocytes from lymph nodes and thymus. There are promising data suggesting that it may also have a direct neuroprotective property independent of peripheral lymphocytopenia.<b>Areas covered</b>: We reviewed the pharmacology and the clinical and radiological effects of siponimod.<b>Expert opinion</b>: The selective effect of siponimod on the S1P1 and S1P5 receptors offers a favorable side-effect profile and transient bradycardia can be avoided by dose titration. A phase-II study showed that siponomod has dose-dependent beneficial effects in patients with relapsing remitting disease. The results of a phase-III study suggest that siponimod may be beneficial in secondary progressive MS, at least in patients with disease activity.

Autoimmune diseases of the central nervous system (CNS) like multiple sclerosis (MS) are characterized by inflammation and demyelinated lesions in white and grey matter regions. While inflammation is present at all stages of MS, it is more pronounced in the relapsing forms of the disease, whereas progressive MS (PMS) shows significant neuroaxonal damage and grey and white matter atrophy. Hence, disease-modifying treatments beneficial in patients with relapsing MS have limited success in PMS. BAF312 (siponimod) is a novel sphingosine-1-phosphate receptor modulator shown to delay progression in PMS. Besides reducing inflammation by sequestering lymphocytes in lymphoid tissues, BAF312 crosses the blood-brain barrier and binds its receptors on neurons, astrocytes and oligodendrocytes. To evaluate potential direct neuroprotective effects, BAF312 was systemically or locally administered in the CNS of experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis mice with distinct grey- and white-matter lesions (focal experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis using an osmotic mini-pump). Ex-vivo flow cytometry revealed that systemic but not local BAF312 administration lowered immune cell infiltration in animals with both grey and white matter lesions. Ex-vivo voltage-sensitive dye imaging of acute brain slices revealed an altered spatio-temporal pattern of activation in the lesioned cortex compared to controls in response to electrical stimulation of incoming white-matter fiber tracts. Here, BAF312 administration showed partial restore of cortical neuronal circuit function. The data suggest that BAF312 exerts a neuroprotective effect after crossing the blood-brain barrier independently of peripheral effects on immune cells. Experiments were carried out in accordance with German and EU animal protection law and approved by local authorities (Landesamt für Natur, Umwelt und Verbraucherschutz Nordrhein-Westfalen; 87-51.04.2010.A331) on December 28, 2010.

BAF312 (siponimod) is a sphingosine-1-phosphate (S1P) receptor modulator in clinical development for the treatment of multiple sclerosis, with faster organ/tissue distribution and elimination kinetics than its precursor FTY720 (fingolimod). Our aim was to develop a tracer to better quantify the penetration of BAF312 in the human brain, with the potential to be labeled for positron emission tomography (PET) or single-photon emission computed tomography (SPECT). Although the PET radioisotopes (11)C and (18)F could have been introduced in BAF312 without modifying its structure, they do not have decay kinetics compatible with the time required for observing the drug's organ distribution in patients. In contrast, the SPECT radioisotope (123) I has a longer half-life and would suit this purpose. Herein we report the identification of an iodinated derivative of BAF312, (E)-1-(4-(1-(((4-cyclohexyl-3-iodobenzyl)oxy)imino)ethyl)-2-ethylbenzyl)azetidine-3-carboxylic acid (18, MS565), as a SPECT tracer candidate with affinity, S1P receptor selectivity, overall physicochemical properties, and blood pharmacokinetics similar to those of the original molecule. A whole-body autoradiography study performed with [(14)C]MS565 subsequently confirmed that its organ distribution is similar to that of BAF312. This validates the selection of MS565 for (123)I radiolabeling and for use in imaging studies to quantify the brain penetration of BAF312.

Traumatic brain injury (TBI) provokes secondary pathological mechanisms, including ischemic and inflammatory processes. The new research in sphingosine 1-phosphate (S1P) receptor modulators has opened the door for an effective mechanism of reducing central nervous system (CNS) inflammatory lesion activity. Thus, the aim of this study was to characterize the immunomodulatory effect of the functional S1PR1 antagonist, siponimod, in phase III clinical trials for autoimmune disorders and of the competitive sphingosine 1-phosphate receptor subtype 1 (S1PR1) antagonist, TASP0277308, in pre-clinical development in an in vivo model of TBI in mice. We used the well-characterized model of TBI caused by controlled cortical impact. Mice were injected intraperitoneally with siponimod or TASP0277308 (1 mg/kg) at 1 and 4 h post-trauma. Our results demonstrated that these agents exerted significant beneficial effects on TBI pre-clinical scores in term of anti-inflammatory and immunomodulatory effects, in particular, attenuation of astrocytes and microglia activation, cytokines release, and rescue of the reduction of adhesion molecules (i.e., occludin and zonula occludens-1). Moreover, these compounds were able to decrease T-cell activation visible by reduction of CD4<sup>+</sup> and CD8<sup>+</sup>, reduce the lesioned area (measured by 2,3,5-triphenyltetrazolium chloride staining), and to preserve tissue architecture, microtubule stability, and neural plasticity. Moreover, our findings provide pre-clinical evidence for the use of low-dose oral S1PR1 antagonists as neuroprotective strategies for TBI and broaden our understanding of the underlying S1PR1-driven neuroinflammatory processes in the pathophysiology of TBI. Altogether, our results showed that blocking the S1PR1 axis is an effective therapeutic strategy to mitigate neuropathological effects engaged in the CNS by TBI.

BAF312 (Siponimod) is a dual agonist at the sphingosine-1 phosphate receptors, S1PR1 and S1PR5. This drug is currently undergoing clinical trials for the treatment of secondary progressive multiple sclerosis (MS). Here, we investigated the effects of BAF312 on isolated astrocyte and microglia cultures as well as in slice culture models of demyelination. Mouse and human astrocytes were treated with S1PR modulators and changes in the levels of pERK, pAkt, and calcium signalling as well as S1PR1 internalization and cytokine levels was investigated using Western blotting, immunochemistry, ELISA and confocal microscopy. Organotypic slice cultures were prepared from the cerebellum of 10-day-old mice and treated with lysophosphatidylcholine (LPC), psychosine and/or S1PR modulators, and changes in myelination states were measured by fluorescence of myelin basic protein and neurofilament H. BAF312 treatment of human and mouse astrocytes activated pERK, pAKT and Ca(2+) signalling as well as inducing S1PR1 internalization. Notably, activation of S1PR1 increased pERK and pAKT in mouse astrocytes while both S1PR1 and S1PR3 equally increased pERK and pAKT in human astrocytes, suggesting that the coupling of S1PR1 and S1PR3 to pERK and pAKT differ in mouse and human astrocytes. We also observed that BAF312 moderately attenuated lipopolysaccharide (LPS)- or TNFα/IL17-induced levels of IL6 in both astrocyte and microglia cell cultures. In organotypic slice cultures, BAF312 reduced LPC-induced levels of IL6 and attenuated LPC-mediated demyelination. We have shown previously that the toxic lipid metabolite psychosine induces demyelination in organotypic slice cultures, without altering the levels of cytokines, such as IL6. Importantly, psychosine-induced demyelination was also attenuated by BAF312. Overall, this study suggests that BAF312 can modulate glial cell function and attenuate demyelination, highlighting this drug as a further potential therapy in demyelinating disorders, beyond MS.

Siponimod is an oral selective modulator of sphingosine 1-phosphate receptor types 1 and type 5, with an elimination half-life leading to washout in 7 days. We aimed to determine the dose-response relation of siponimod in terms of its effects on brain MRI lesion activity and characterise safety and tolerability in patients with relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis. In this double-blind, adaptive dose-ranging phase 2 study, we enrolled adults (aged 18-55 years) with relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis at 73 medical centres in Europe and North America. We tested two patient cohorts sequentially, separated by an interim analysis at 3 months. We randomly allocated patients in cohort 1 (1:1:1:1) to receive once-daily siponimod 10 mg, 2 mg, or 0·5 mg, or placebo for 6 months. We randomly allocated patients in cohort 2 (4:4:1) to siponimod 1·25 mg, siponimod 0·25 mg, or placebo once-daily for 3 months. Randomisation was done with a central, automated system and patients and investigators were masked to treatment assignment. The primary endpoint was dose-response, assessed by percentage reduction in monthly number of combined unique active lesions at 3 months for siponimod versus placebo; this endpoint was analysed by a multiple comparison procedure with modelling techniques in all patients with at least one MRI scan up to 3 months. We assessed safety in all patients who received at least one dose of study drug. This study is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT00879658. Between March 30, 2009, and Oct 22, 2010, we recruited 188 patients into cohort 1 and 109 patients into cohort 2. We showed a dose-response relation (p=0·0001) across the five doses of siponimod, with reductions in combined unique active lesions at 3 months compared with placebo of 35% (95% CI 17-57) for siponimod 0·25 mg (51 patients included in the primary endpoint analysis), 50% (29-69) for siponimod 0·5 mg (43 patients), 66% (48-80) for siponimod 1·25 mg (42 patients), 72% (57-84) for siponimod 2 mg (45 patients), and 82% (70-90) for siponimod 10 mg (44 patients). In patients treated for 6 months, 37 (86%) of 43 patients who received siponimod 0·5 mg had adverse events (eight serious), as did 48 (98%) of 49 patients who received siponimod 2 mg (four serious), 48 (96%) of 50 patients who received siponimod 10 mg (three serious), and 36 (80%) of 45 controls (none serious). For individuals treated to 3 months, 38 (74%) of 51 patients who received siponimod 0·25 mg had adverse events (none serious), as did 29 (69%) of 42 patients who received siponimod 1·25 mg (two serious) and 13 (81%) of 16 controls (none serious). Therapeutic effects of siponimod on MRI lesion activity in model-based analyses and its tolerability in relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis warrant investigation in a phase 3 trial.

Among patients with multiple sclerosis, discontinuing highly effective disease-modifying treatments can potentially lead to severe disease recurrence, especially cessation of natalizumab and fingolimod. Similar to fingolimod, siponimod is a sphingosine-1-phosphate receptor modulator that inhibits the egress of a lymphocyte subpopulation from lymph nodes. In the present case report, we describe a patient with MS who experienced substantial disease exacerbation after withdrawal from siponimod.

Background and Purpose- The contribution of neuroinflammation and, in particular, the infiltration of the brain by lymphocytes is increasingly recognized as a substantial pathophysiological mechanism after stroke. The interaction of lymphocytes with endothelial cells and platelets, termed thromboinflammation, fosters microvascular dysfunction and secondary infarct growth. Siponimod is an S1PR (sphingosine-1-phosphate receptor) modulator, which blocks the egress of lymphocytes from lymphoid organs and has demonstrated beneficial effects in multiple sclerosis treatment. We investigated the effect of treatment with siponimod on stroke outcome in a mouse model of cerebral ischemia. Methods- Transient middle cerebral artery occlusion was induced in middle-aged wild-type mice. Animals were either treated with siponimod (3 mg/kg; intraperitoneal) or vehicle for 6 days. Stroke outcome was assessed by magnetic resonance imaging (spleen volume: prestroke, day 3, and day 7; infarct volume: days 1, 3, and 7) and behavioral tests (prestroke, day 2, and day 6). Immune cells of the peripheral blood and brain-infiltrating cells ipsilateral and contralateral were analyzed by VETScan and by flow cytometry. Results- Siponimod significantly induced lymphopenia on day 7 after transient middle cerebral artery occlusion and reduced T-lymphocyte accumulation in the central nervous system. No effect was detected for lesion size. Conclusions- For siponimod administered at 3 mg/kg in transient middle cerebral artery occlusion mouse model, our findings do not provide preclinical evidence for the use of S1PR1/5 modulators as neuroprotectant in stroke therapy.

Siponimod (BAF312) is a synthetic molecule belonging to the sphingosine-1-phosphate (S1P) modulator family, which has putative neuroprotective properties and well-characterized immunomodulating effects mediated by sequestration of B and T cells in secondary lymphoid organs. Compared to fingolimod (ie, precursor of the S1P modulators commercially available for the treatment of relapsing-remitting [RR] multiple sclerosis [MS]), siponimod exhibits selective affinity for types 1 and 5 S1P receptor, leading to a lower risk of adverse events that are mainly induced by S1P3 receptor activation, such as bradycardia and vasoconstriction. In addition, S1P1 and S1P5 receptors are expressed by neurons and glia and could mediate a possible neuroprotective effect of the drug. A Phase II clinical trial of siponimod for RR MS showed a significant effect of the active drug compared to placebo on reducing gadolinium-enhancing lesions on brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) after 3 months of treatment. In a recently completed Phase III trial, treatment with siponimod was associated with a significant reduction in disability progression in secondary progressive (SP) MS patients compared to placebo. In this article, current evidence supporting siponimod efficacy for SP MS is reviewed.

Myasthenia gravis (MG) is an autoimmune disease characterized by muscle weakness and fatigue in the presence of circulating antibodies against components of the neuromuscular junction. Most patients have a good prognosis, but some are refractory to standard-of-care immunosuppressive treatment and suffer from recurrent myasthenic crises. Functional sphingosine-1-phosphate (S1P) antagonists like fingolimod and siponimod (BAF312) are successfully used for the treatment of multiple sclerosis, and fingolimod was shown to prevent the development of myasthenic symptoms in experimental autoimmune myasthenia gravis (EAMG), the standard model of MG. Here, we investigated whether fingolimod or siponimod improves outcome in EAMG mice when administered after disease onset, modeling the clinical setting in human MG. Both S1P antagonists inhibited lymphocyte egress, resulting in peripheral lymphopenia. After stimulation, there were differences in T-cell responses, but no change in either antibody titers or total or antigen-specific plasma cell populations after treatment. Most importantly, disease incidence and severity were not influenced by fingolimod or siponimod therapy. Although fingolimod and siponimod did lead to subtle changes in T-cell responses, they had no significant effect on antibody titers and disease severity. In conclusion, our data show no evidence of a therapeutic potential for S1P receptor antagonists in MG treatment.

A high incidence of hemangiosarcoma (HSA) was observed in mice treated for 2 years with siponimod, a sphingosine-1-phosphate receptor 1 (S1P1) functional antagonist, while no such tumors were observed in rats under the same treatment conditions. In 3-month rat (90 mg/kg/day) and 9-month mouse (25 and 75 mg/kg/day) in vivo mechanistic studies, vascular endothelial cell (VEC) activation was observed in both species, but VEC proliferation and persistent increases in circulating placental growth factor 2 (PLGF2) were only seen in the mouse. In mice, these effects were sustained over the 9-month study duration, while in rats increased mitotic gene expression was present at day 3 only and PLGF2 was induced only during the first week of treatment. In the mouse, the persistent VEC activation, mitosis induction, and PLGF2 stimulation likely led to sustained neo-angiogenesis which over life-long treatment may result in HSA formation. In rats, despite sustained VEC activation, the transient mitotic and PLGF2 stimuli did not result in the formation of HSA. In vitro, the mouse and rat primary endothelial cell cultures mirrored their respective in vivo findings for cell proliferation and PLGF2 release. Human VECs, like rat cells, were unresponsive to siponimod treatment with no proliferative response and no release of PLGF2 at all tested concentrations. Hence, it is suggested that the human cells also reproduce a lack of in vivo response to siponimod. In conclusion, the molecular mechanisms leading to siponimod-induced HSA in mice are considered species specific and likely irrelevant to humans.

Fingolimod, a sphingosine 1-phosphate (S1P) receptor subtype 1, 3, 4 and 5 modulator, has been used for the treatment of patients with relapsing forms of multiple sclerosis, but atrioventricular conduction block and/or QT-interval prolongation have been reported in some patients after the first dose. In this study, we directly compared the electropharmacological profiles of fingolimod with those of siponimod, a modulator of sphingosine 1-phosphate receptor subtype 1 and 5, using in vivo guinea-pig model and in vitro human ether-a-go-go-related gene (hERG) assay to better understand the onset mechanisms of the clinically observed adverse events. Fingolimod (0.01 and 0.1mg/kg) or siponimod (0.001 and 0.01mg/kg) was intravenously infused over 10min to the halothane-anaesthetized guinea pigs (n=4), whereas the effects of fingolimod (1μmol/L) and siponimod (1μmol/L) on hERG current were examined (n=3). The high doses of fingolimod and siponimod induced atrioventricular conduction block, whereas the low dose of siponimod prolonged PR interval, which was not observed by that of fingolimod. The high dose of fingolimod prolonged QT interval, which was not observed by either dose of siponimod. Meanwhile, fingolimod significantly inhibited hERG current, which was not observed by siponimod. These results suggest that S1P receptor subtype 1 in the heart could be one of the candidates for fingolimod- and siponimod-induced atrioventricular conduction block since S1P receptor subtype 5 is localized at the brain, and that direct IKr inhibition may play a key role in fingolimod-induced QT-interval prolongation.

Siponimod (Mayzent<sup>®</sup>) is an oral selective sphingosine 1-phosphate receptor subtypes 1 and 5 (S1PR<sub>1,5</sub>) modulator being developed by Novartis Pharmaceuticals for the treatment of multiple sclerosis (MS) and intracerebral haemorrhage. In March 2019, siponimod received its first global approval in the USA, for the treatment of adults with relapsing forms of MS, including clinically isolated syndrome, relapsing-remitting disease and active secondary progressive disease. Siponimod is under regulatory review in the EU and Japan for secondary progressive MS. This article summarizes the milestone in the development of siponimod leading to this first global approval for MS in the USA.

In multiple sclerosis, development of screening tools for remyelination-promoting molecules is timely. A Xenopus transgenic line allowing conditional ablation of myelinating oligodendrocytes has been adapted for in vivo screening of remyelination-favoring molecules. In this transgenic, the green fluorescent protein reporter is fused to E. coli nitroreductase and expressed specifically in myelinating oligodendrocytes. Nitroreductase converts the innocuous pro-drug metronidazole to a cytotoxin. Spontaneous remyelination occurs after metronidazole-induced demyelinating responses. As tadpoles are transparent, these events can be monitored in vivo and quantified. At the end of metronidazole-induced demyelination, tadpoles were screened in water containing the compounds tested. After 72 h, remyelination was assayed by counting numbers of oligodendrocytes per optic nerve. Among a battery of molecules tested, siponimod, a dual agonist of sphingosine-1-phosphate receptor 1 and 5, was among the most efficient favoring remyelination. Crispr/cas9 gene editing showed that the promyelinating effect of siponimod involves the sphingosine-1-phosphate receptor 5. This Xenopus transgenic line constitutes a simple in vivo screening platform for myelin repair therapeutics. We validated several known promyelinating compounds and demonstrated that the strong remyelinating efficacy of siponimod implicates the sphingosine-1-phosphate receptor 5.

Siponimod, a next-generation selective sphingosine-1-phosphate receptor modulator, is currently being investigated for the treatment of secondary progressive multiple sclerosis. We investigated the absorption, distribution, metabolism, and excretion (ADME) of a single 10-mg oral dose of [<sup>14</sup>C]siponimod in four healthy men. Mass balance, blood and plasma radioactivity, and plasma siponimod concentrations were measured. Metabolite profiles were determined in plasma, urine, and feces. Metabolite structures were elucidated using mass spectrometry and comparison with reference compounds. Unchanged siponimod accounted for 57% of the total plasma radioactivity (area under the concentration-time curve), indicating substantial exposure to metabolites. Siponimod showed medium to slow absorption (median <i>T</i><sub>max</sub>: 4 hours) and moderate distribution (Vz/F: 291 l). Siponimod was mainly cleared through biotransformation, predominantly by oxidative metabolism. The mean apparent elimination half-life of siponimod in plasma was 56.6 hours. Siponimod was excreted mostly in feces in the form of oxidative metabolites. The excretion of radioactivity was close to complete after 13 days. Based on the metabolite patterns, a phase II metabolite (M3) formed by glucuronidation of hydroxylated siponimod was the main circulating metabolite in plasma. However, in subsequent mouse ADME and clinical pharmacokinetic studies, a long-lived nonpolar metabolite (M17, cholesterol ester of siponimod) was identified as the most prominent systemic metabolite. We further conducted in vitro experiments to investigate the enzymes responsible for the oxidative metabolism of siponimod. The selective inhibitor and recombinant enzyme results identified cytochrome P450 2C9 (CYP2C9) as the predominant contributor to the human liver microsomal biotransformation of siponimod, with minor contributions from CYP3A4 and other cytochrome P450 enzymes.

Data from multiple sclerosis (MS) and the MS rodent model, experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE), highlighted an inflammation-dependent synaptopathy at the basis of the neurodegenerative damage causing irreversible disability in these disorders. This synaptopathy is characterized by an imbalance between glutamatergic and GABAergic transmission and has been proposed to be a potential therapeutic target. Siponimod (BAF312), a selective sphingosine 1-phosphate1,5 receptor modulator, is currently under investigation in a clinical trial in secondary progressive MS patients. We investigated whether siponimod, in addition to its peripheral immune modulation, may exert direct neuroprotective effects in the central nervous system (CNS) of mice with chronic progressive EAE. Minipumps allowing continuous intracerebroventricular (icv) infusion of siponimod for 4 weeks were implanted into C57BL/6 mice subjected to MOG35-55-induced EAE. Electrophysiology, immunohistochemistry, western blot, qPCR experiments, and peripheral lymphocyte counts were performed. In addition, the effect of siponimod on activated microglia was assessed in vitro to confirm the direct effect of the drug on CNS-resident immune cells. Siponimod administration (0.45 μg/day) induced a significant beneficial effect on EAE clinical scores with minimal effect on peripheral lymphocyte counts. Siponimod rescued defective GABAergic transmission in the striatum of EAE, without correcting the EAE-induced alterations of glutamatergic transmission. We observed a significant attenuation of astrogliosis and microgliosis together with reduced lymphocyte infiltration in the striatum of EAE mice treated with siponimod. Interestingly, siponimod reduced the release of IL-6 and RANTES from activated microglial cells in vitro, which might explain the reduced lymphocyte infiltration. Furthermore, the loss of parvalbumin-positive (PV+) GABAergic interneurons typical of EAE brains was rescued by siponimod treatment, providing a plausible explanation of the selective effects of this drug on inhibitory synaptic transmission. Altogether, our results show that siponimod has neuroprotective effects in the CNS of EAE mice, which are likely independent of its peripheral immune effect, suggesting that this drug could be effective in limiting neurodegenerative pathological processes in MS.
