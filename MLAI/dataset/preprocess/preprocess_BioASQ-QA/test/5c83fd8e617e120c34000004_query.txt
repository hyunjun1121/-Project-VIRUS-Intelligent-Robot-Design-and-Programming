[PMID: 30072652]
Phlorotannin is the collective term for polyphenols derived from brown algae belonging to the genera <i>Ascopyllum</i>, <i>Ecklonia</i>, <i>Eisenia</i>, <i>Fucus</i> and <i>Sargassum</i> etc. Since the incidence of allergies is currently increasing in the world, there is a focus on phlorotannins having anti-allergic and anti-inflammatory effects. In this study, six purified phlorotannins (eckol; 6,6'-bieckol; 6,8'-bieckol; 8,8'-bieckol; phlorofucofuroeckol (PFF)-A and PFF-B) from <i>Eisenia arborea</i>, orally administered to mice, were examined for their suppression effects on ear swelling. In considering the suppression, we also examined whether the phlorotannins suppressed release of chemical mediators (histamine, leukotriene B₄ and prostaglandin E₂), and mRNA expression and/or the activity of cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2), using RBL-2H3 cells, a cultured mast cell model. Results showed that the phlorotnannins exhibited suppression effects in all experiments, with 6,8'-bieckol, 8,8'-bieckol and PFF-A showing the strongest of these effects. In conclusion, orally administered phlorotannins suppress mouse ear swelling, and this mechanism apparently involves suppression of chemical mediator release and COX-2 mRNA expression or activity. This is the first report of the anti-allergic effects of the orally administered purified phlorotannins in vivo. Phlorotannins show potential for use in functional foods or drugs.

Brown algae are rich in polyphenolic compounds, phlorotannins, which have been found to possess high in vitro antioxidant capacity, especially DPPH radical scavenging activity, due to the high number of hydroxyl groups. Whereas, the overall antioxidant capacity of brown algae extracts has been widely studied, the antioxidant capacity of individual phlorotannins has been rarely explored. The aim of this study was to determine the structure dependant antioxidant capacity of phlorotannins from Icelandic brown algae, Fucus vesiculosus. The antioxidant capacity of individual phlorotannins was determined by an on-line method using liquid chromatography and an electrochemical detector followed by quadrupole Time of Flight mass spectrometry (UHPLC-DAD-ECD-QTOFMS). Tentative structural elucidation of 13 phlorotannin isomers from EAF was obtained by LC-DAD-QTOFMS, ranging from 374 to 870Da. On-line determination of antioxidant capacity of the individual phlorotannins generally showed that low molecular phlorotannins exhibited higher antioxidant capacity and that the capacity decreased with polymerisation.

(Poly)phenols and, specifically, phlorotannins present in brown seaweeds have previously been shown to inhibit α-amylase and α-glucosidase, key enzymes involved in the breakdown and intestinal absorption of carbohydrates. Related to this are observations of modulation of post-prandial glycemic response in mice and increased insulin sensitivity in humans when supplemented with seaweed extract. However, no studies to date have explored the effect of seaweed extract on cognition. The current randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind, parallel groups study examined the impact of a brown seaweed extract on cognitive function post-prandially in 60 healthy adults (<i>N</i> = 30 per group). Computerized measures of episodic memory, attention and subjective state were completed at baseline and 5 times at 40 min intervals over a 3 h period following lunch, with either seaweed or placebo consumed 30 min prior to lunch. Analysis was conducted with linear mixed models controlling for baseline. Seaweed led to significant improvements to accuracy on digit vigilance (<i>p</i> = 0.035) and choice reaction time (<i>p</i> = 0.043) tasks. These findings provide the first evidence for modulation of cognition with seaweed extract. In order to explore the mechanism underlying these effects, future research should examine effects on cognition in parallel with blood glucose and insulin responses.

A process for the effective extraction and fractionation of phlorotannins from Fucus vesiculosus with high antioxidant potentials was investigated. The antioxidant activity of F. vesiculosus extract/fractions was assessed by 2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl (DPPH) radical scavenging, reducing power, and ferrous ion-chelating assays. Among the crude extract and different polarity fractions, the phlorotannin-enriched ethyl acetate fraction possessed the highest DPPH scavenging activity and reducing power. This fraction was further fractionated by Sephadex LH-20 column chromatography or ultrafiltration. The antioxidant properties were evaluated by both the above chemical antioxidant tests and a mononuclear cell-based bioassay. Sephadex subfractions LH-2 and LH-3 with high total phlorotannin content exhibited strong DPPH quenching activity, comparable to those of ascorbic acid and butylated hydroxytoluene and significantly higher than that of α-tocopherol. Polyphenols in F. vesiculosus were found to consist mainly of high molecular weight phlorotannin polymers. There were no clear relationships between the degree of polymerization, molecular size, and antioxidant activity. All the subfractions separated by Sephadex LH-20 column chromatography and ultrafiltration showed a high ability to scavenge reactive oxygen species generated by mononuclear cells. Further characterization of the phlorotannin compounds was performed on six Sephadex subfractions. Several phlorotannin oligomers were tentatively identified on the basis of HPLC-ESI-MS(n) analyses.

Phlorotannins, phenolic compounds produced exclusively by seaweeds, have been reported to possess various pharmacological properties. However, there have been few works on these compounds from Mediterranean seaweeds. In this study, we investigated the phytochemical analysis and pharmacological potential of phlorotannin-rich fractions from three brown seaweeds collected along the Tunisia coast: Cystoseira sedoides (PHT-SED), Cladostephus spongeosis (PHT-CLAD), and Padina pavonica (PHT-PAD). Phytochemical determinations showed considerable differences in total phenolic content (TPC) and phlorotannin content (PHT). The highest TPC level (26.45 mg PGE/g dry material (Dm)) and PHT level (873.14 μg PGE/g Dm) were observed in C. sedoides. The antioxidant properties of these three fractions assessed by three different methods indicated that C. sedoides displayed the highest total antioxidant activity among the three species (71.30 mg GAE/g Dm), as well as the free radical scavenging activity with the lowest IC<sub>50</sub> value in both DPPH (27.7 μg/mL) and ABTS (19.1 μg/mL) assays. Furthermore, the pharmacological screening of the anti-inflammatory potential of these fractions using in vivo models, in comparison to reference drugs, established a remarkable activity of PHT-SED at the dose of 100 mg/kg; the inhibition percentages of ear edema in mice model and paw edema in rats model were of 82.55 and 81.08%, respectively. The content of malondialdehyde (MDA) in liver tissues has been quantified, and PHT-SED was found to remarkably increase the lipid peroxidation in rat liver tissues. In addition, in two pain mice models, PHT-SED displayed a profound antinociceptive activity at 100 mg/kg and has proved a better analgesic activity when used in combination with the opioid drug, tramadol.

Alzheimer's disease is a progressive neurodegenerative disorder that mainly affects the elderly. Soluble β-amyloid oligomer, which can induce neurotoxicity, is generally regarded as the main neurotoxin in Alzheimer's disease. Here we report that eckmaxol, a phlorotannin extracted from the brown alga Ecklonia maxima, could produce neuroprotective effects in SH-SY5Y cells. Eckmaxol effectively prevented but did not rescue β-amyloid oligomer-induced neuronal apoptosis and increase of intracellular reactive oxygen species. Eckmaxol also significantly reversed the decreased expression of phospho-Ser9-glycogen synthase kinase 3β and increased expression of phospho-extracellular signal-regulated kinase, which was induced by Aβ oligomer. Moreover, both glycogen synthase kinase 3β and mitogen activated protein kinase inhibitors produced neuroprotective effects in SH-SY5Y cells. Furthermore, eckmaxol showed favorable interaction in the ATP binding site of glycogen synthase kinase 3β and mitogen activated protein kinase. These results suggested that eckmaxol might produce neuroprotective effects via concurrent inhibition of glycogen synthase kinase 3β and extracellular signal-regulated kinase pathways, possibly via directly acting on glycogen synthase kinase 3β and mitogen activated protein kinase. Based on the central role that β-amyloid oligomers play in the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease and the high annual production of Ecklonia maxima for alginate and other nutritional ingredients, this report represents a new candidate for the treatment of Alzheimer's disease, and also expands the potential application of Ecklonia maxima and its constituents in the field of pharmacology.
