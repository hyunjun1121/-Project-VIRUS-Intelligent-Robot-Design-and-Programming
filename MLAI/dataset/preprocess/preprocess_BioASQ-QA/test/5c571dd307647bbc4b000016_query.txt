What organism causes hepatic capillariasis?

[PMID: 28460612]
Zoonotic infections are increasingly becoming public health menaces and are usually transmitted to humans due to unsuitable environmental conditions. One of them is hepatic capillariasis, caused by the parasite Capillaria hepatica, primarily a disease of rodents, with hepatic manifestations in humans. Although its prevalence is very low, it can cause significant morbidity and mortality, with cases reported from all over the world. The main infective form for humans is the embryonated egg of the parasite, which hatches in the intestine and ultimately colonize the liver. The larvae mature and reproduce, and eventually form embryonated eggs, which cause chronic focal inflammation and septal hepatic fibrosis. Clinical presentation mainly consists of fever, abdominal pain, hepatomegaly and eosinophilia. Spurious infection with unembryonated eggs cause gastrointestinal symptoms. Diagnostic modalities include liver biopsy, ultrasonography, CT scan, immunological tests like ELISA and IIFT. The infection can be treated mainly with a combination of benzimidazoles like thiabendazole, mebendazole and albendazole; with corticosteroids. The study emphasizes the need for hepatic capillariasis to be considered as a differential diagnosis in cases of suspected hepatitis, leptospirosis, abdominal lymphadenopathy or other hepatic or parasitic infections prevalent in the region concerned; and meticulously assess the cases to facilitate early diagnosis and prompt treatment, thus reducing the distress faced by patients.

Capillaria hepatica (C. hepatica) is a parasitic nematode causing hepatic capillariasis in numerous mammals. Ecologic studies showed that the first hosts of C. hepatica were rodents, among which rats had relatively high infection rates, which explains why C. hepatica spreads globally. Anatomical studies showed that the liver was the principal site of colonization by these parasites and physical damage tended to occur. Although C. hepatica might lead to serious liver disorders, relevant clinical reports were rare, because of the non-specific nature of clinical symptoms, leading to misdiagnosis. This review mainly focuses on the biological characteristics and epidemiology of C. hepatica in China and histopathologic changes in the liver, with expectation of gaining a better understanding of the disease and seeking more effective treatment.

Capillaria hepatica which accidentally infects humans is a zoonotic parasite of mammalian liver, primarily rodents and causes hepatic capillariasis. The diagnosis is difficult because of the non-specific nature of clinical symptoms, leading to misdiagnosis and can be confirmed only through liver biopsy or on autopsy results. This paper is written with an objective to report a new case of hepatic capillariasis as a rare differential for peripheral eosinophilia and an imaging dilemma for abdominal lymphadenopathy.
