We report the case of a patient in whom the diagnosis of Ewing sarcoma arising from a soft tissue was made after successful treatment of diffuse large B-cell lymphoma. A 65-year-old woman presented with a rapidly growing mass in her left scapular region 8 years after successful chemotherapy with the cyclophosphamide, hydroxydaunomycin hydrochloride, vincristine, prednisolone regimen for diffuse large B-cell lymphoma. Computed tomographic examination and magnetic resonance imaging of the thorax revealed an intramuscular tumour measuring 40 mm in size in the left scapular region. Histopathological examination of an open biopsy specimen revealed a small round cell tumour that showed positive staining for CD99. Fluorescence in situ hybridization showed a split signal by a break-apart probe for the EWS gene in chromosome 22q12. Reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction confirmed the expression of EWS-FLI1 fusion transcripts. Based on these findings, the patient was diagnosed as having secondary Ewing sarcoma. Despite adjuvant chemotherapy, however, she died of pulmonary metastases 2 years after the diagnosis of Ewing sarcoma. Therapy-related haematological malignancies with balanced translocations have been reported previously. A mechanism similar to that underlying the development of secondary malignancy might explain the occurrence of this solid cancer.

We evaluated the feasibility and usefulness of reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) on fine-needle aspirates for categorization of small blue round cell tumors (SBRCTs). A total of 51 cases, including 25 Ewing sarcoma/peripheral primitive neuroectodermal tumors (PNETs), 11 rhabdomyosarcomas, 13 neuroblastomas, and 2 desmoplastic small round cell tumors (DSRCTs) were analyzed. The detection of the EWS-FLI1 (20/25) and EWS-ERG (4/25) fusion transcripts resolved 24 of 25 cases of Ewing sarcoma/PNET. The PAX3/7-FKHR fusion transcript was detected in 2 of 4 cases of alveolar rhabdomyosarcoma and the EWS-WT1 transcript in both cases of DSRCT. Tyrosine hydroxylase and 3,4-dihydroxyphenylalanine (dopa) decarboxylase transcripts were demonstrated in 10 of 13 cases of neuroblastoma. In comparison, immunocytochemical analysis resolved 19 (76%) of 25 Ewing sarcomas, 9 (82%) of 11 rhabdomyosarcomas, 6 (46%) of 13 neuroblastomas, and 1 (50%) of 2 DSRCTs. Overall, RT-PCR resolved 38 (86%) of 44 vs 35 (69%) of 51 cases by immunocytochemical analysis. RT-PCR is easily applied to fine-needle aspirates of SBRCT and greatly facilitates accurate tumor typing.

More than 90% of Ewing's sarcomas (ES) contain a fusion of the EWS and FLI1 genes, due to the t(11;22)(q24;q12) translocation. At the molecular level, the EWS-FLI1 rearrangements show great diversity. Specifically, many different combinations of exons from EWS and FLI1 encode in-frame fusion transcripts and result in differences in the length and composition of the chimeric protein, which functions as an oncogenic aberrant transcription factor. In the most common fusion type (type 1), EWS exon 7 is linked in frame with exon 6 of FLI1. As the fundamental pathogenetic lesion in ES, the molecular heterogeneity of these fusion transcripts may have functional and clinical significance. We performed a clinical and pathologic analysis of 112 patients with ES in which EWS-FLI1 fusion transcripts were identified by reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). Adequate treatment and follow-up data were available in 99 patients treated with curative intent. Median follow-up in these 99 patients was 26 months (range, 1 to 140 months). Univariate and multivariate survival analyses were performed that included other prognostic factors, such as age, tumor location, size, and stage. Among the 99 patients suitable for survival analysis, the tumors in 64 patients contained the type 1 fusion and in 35 patients contained less common fusion types. Stage at presentation was localized in 74 patients and metastatic in 25. Metastases (relative risk [RR] = 2.6; P = .008), and type 1 EWS-FLI1 fusion (RR = 0.37; P = .014) were, respectively, independent negative and positive prognostic factors for overall survival by multivariate analysis. Among 74 patients with localized tumors, the type 1 EWS-FLI1 fusion was also a significant positive predictor of overall survival (RR = 0.32; P = .034) by multivariate analysis. EWS-FLI1 fusion type appears to be prognostically relevant in ES, independent of tumor site, stage, and size. Further studies are needed to clarify the biologic basis of this phenomenon.

Ewing's sarcoma/peripheral primitive neuroectodermal tumor (ES/pPNET) is often difficult to distinguish from other small round cell tumors. The EWS-Ets gene fusions that result from chromosomal translocations in this tumor provide potential molecular diagnostic markers. To apply these molecular markers to commonly available archival materials, we evaluated the feasibility of detecting EWS-Ets including EWS-Fli1 and EWS-ERG fusion transcripts in paraffin-embedded tissues and its diagnostic value for detecting ES/pPNET. Thirteen paraffin-embedded samples of ES/pPNETs were retrieved from archives. Thirteen cases of other tumors with small round cell features (including rhabdomyosarcoma, neuroblastoma, lymphoma, small cell carcinoma, and desmoplastic small round cell tumor) were used as negative controls. Beta-actin and beta2-microglobulin were used as internal controls. A nested reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR)-based assay was performed to detect the EWS-Fli1 and EWS-ERG fusion transcripts. Beta-actin and beta2-microglobulin were detected in 10/13 and 13/13 ES/pPNETs, respectively. EWS-Fli1 fusion transcripts were detected in 11 of 13 (85%) ES/pPNETs. Three chimeric transcripts, all EWS-Fli1, were detected in ES/pPNET samples. Among 11 EWS-Fli1-positive cases, 7 cases had a type I fusion transcript involving fusion of EWS exon 7 with Fli1 exon 6, 2 cases had a type II fusion transcript involving EWS exon 7 with Fli1 exon 5, and 2 cases expressed fusion transcripts involving EWS exon 7 and Fli1 exon 8. Type I EWS-Fli1 fusion predominated over other types. Fusion types could not be distinguished in the remaining 2 cases. Thirteen negative controls did not show detectable chimeric messages. There was a significant relationship between EWS-Fli1 fusion transcripts and CD99 expression. Molecular detection of EWS-Fli1 fusion transcripts in formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded material by nested RT-PCR is feasible and is useful for the diagnosis and differential diagnosis of ES/pPNETs.

The t(11.22)(q24.q12) results in expression of a chimeric RNA product, EWS-FLI1. This RNA product is expressed in over 85% of tumours belonging to the Ewing's family, and is increasingly used as a definitive characteristic of these tumours. In this study, we evaluated reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain (RT-PCR) for EWS-FLI1 fusion transcripts in 18 neurally derived small round cell tumours. These included six Ewing's family tumours and 12 neuroblastomas. EWS-FLI1 fusion transcripts were identified in all six Ewing's tumours, but also in two of the 12 neuroblastomas. One neuroblastoma contained the classic type 1 fusion transcript, and the second a type 1 transcript containing a 66 bp (base pair) insert that was not derived from the EWS or FLI1 gene. The presence of EWS-FLI1 fusion products in RNA extracted from primary neuroblastoma suggests the identification of EWS-FLI1 fusion transcripts is not pathognomonic for tumours of the Ewing's family. The clinical significance of these fusion transcripts in neuroblastoma is not known.

Over the years, a wide clinicopathological spectrum has been identified within Ewing family of tumors (EFTs). As these tumors are chemosensitive, their correct and timely identification is necessary. The aims of this study were (1) to present the diverse clinicopathological and molecular profile of EFTs in our settings, (2) to identify a pragmatic approach for diagnosing EFTs, especially for application of ancillary techniques, namely RT-PCR for specific transcripts (EWS-FLI1, EWS-ERG) and FISH for EWSR1 gene rearrangement, in certain cases and (3) to show the utility of tissue microarray in establishing a new FISH test. Fifty-eight EFTs were identified in 38 males and 20 females within an age-range of 1-65 years (median, 16), mostly in lower extremities (14) (24.1 %). Therapeutically, most patients underwent neoadjuvant chemotherapy with subsequent surgery. Histopathologically, diagnosis of EFTs was initially offered in 41/58 (70.6 %) tumors. On review, 59 % tumors showed diffuse pattern, while 41 % displayed rosettes. Immunohistochemically, tumor cells were mostly diffusely positive for CD99 (48/52) (92.3 %); FLI-1 (17/18) (94.4 %); variably for BCL2 (16/18) (88.8 %), synaptophysin (6/20) (35 %), S100-P (2/7) (28.5 %), CD56 (2/5) (40 %), NSE (2/5) (40 %), calponin (3/4) (75 %), EMA (5/24) (20.8 %) and CK (3/24) (12.5 %), the latter two mostly focally. Fifty five tumors were EWS-FLI1 positive, while a single tumor was EWS-ERG positive. Sensitivity for PCR was 61 %. EWSR1 rearrangement was detected by FISH in 12/13 Ewing sarcomas/PNETs. Sensitivity for EWSR1 test was 92.3 % and specificity was 100 %. Thirty-eight tumors, including 14 molecular confirmed EFTs and 21 other tumors were tested for EWSR1 rearrangement. Among 21 unrelated tumors, EWSR1 rearrangement was detected in few myoepithelial tumors, occasional desmoplastic small round cell tumor and an extraskeletal myxoid chondrosarcoma. Further, a tissue microarray with a separate set of 8 EFTs, confirmed at another laboratory was analysed for validation of EWSR1 rearrangement test. 23/28 (82.1 %) tissue cores of the tissue microarray, stained by FISH were interpretable, including EWSR1 rearrangement, detected in 20/28 tissue cores; not detected in 3 liver cores and uninterpretable in 5 (17.8 %) cores. Classical EFTs can be diagnosed with diffuse, membranous CD99 positivity, intranuclear FLI1 positivity and LCA negativity in malignant round cells. In unconventional cases, it is indispensable to reveal the concomitant fusion m-RNA by RT-PCR. In case of negative molecular results, it is necessary to prove EWSR1 rearrangement by FISH. These tests should be interpreted with clinicopathological correlation. Tissue microarrays for FISH are useful during validation of a new test, especially when sarcomas like EFTs show less genetic heterogeneity within tumor cells.

Chromosomal translocations generating unique chimeric genes are highly characteristic of specific sarcomas, and their use as diagnostic markers has been suggested. From a diagnostic pathologic point of view, detection of such cytogenetic or molecular aberrations applicable to routinely processed archival tissue specimens is considered a powerful tool for tumor diagnosis. To assess the feasibility and reliability of the molecular detection of the transcript originating from the chimeric gene in paraffin-embedded tumor specimens, we performed a nested reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR)-based assay to detect the EWS-FLI1 chimeric message in a series of Ewing family tumors. Of 24 paraffin-embedded tumor specimens from 23 cases analyzed, the chimeric message was detectable in 20 (83%) specimens from 20 cases (87%) by this nested RT-PCR assay, whereas none of 7 small round cell tumors not from this family (3 alveolar rhabdomyosarcomas, 2 neuroblastomas, 2 malignant lymphomas) showed detectable chimeric messages. In the sequence analysis of the PCR products, the amplified chimeric messages contained the junctions between exon 7 of the EWS gene and any one of exons 5, 6 and 8 of the FLI1 gene. The detection process was usually completed within 3 days, except for the subseqent sequence analysis. Our results endorse the use of this molecular assay as an ancillary technique in the diagnosis of Ewing family tumors using paraffin-embedded material.

The utility of preclinical models of childhood cancers is contingent upon reliably classifying them with their corresponding clinical counterparts. Molecular tools such as gene expression profiling allow researchers to confirm the similarity between clinical tumors and preclinical models. We describe the use of gene expression profiling to show that SK-NEP-1, a cell line previously thought to represent anaplastic Wilms tumor, is instead related to Ewing sarcoma. RT-PCR confirmed that SK-NEP-1 expresses EWS-FLI1 gene fusion transcripts characteristic of Ewing sarcoma, and DNA sequencing demonstrated the joining of exon 7 of EWS with exon 5 of FLI1 for these transcripts. Rh1, which was previously categorized as an alveolar rhabdomyosarcoma cell line, also has a gene expression profile suggestive of Ewing sarcoma and expresses EWS-FLI1 fusion transcripts in which exon 7 of EWS is joined with exon 6 of FLI1. These examples illustrate the importance of molecularly characterizing pediatric preclinical models used for testing new agents.

To investigate the expression of EWS-FLI1/ERG fusion transcript resulting from t(11;12)(q24;12) in paraffin-embedded tissues and its diagnostic implication for Ewing's sarcoma/peripheral primitive neuroectodermal tumors (ES/pPNET). One-step reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) was employed to detect a characteristic EWS-FLI1/ERG fusion transcript in 25 cases of ES/pPNET and 15 cases of other small round cell tumors (including 8 cases of rhabdomyosarcoma, 4 cases of synovial sarcoma, 2 cases of neuroblastoma and 1 case of lymphoma) using formalin-fixed and paraffin-embedded tissues. EWS-FLI1/ERG fusion transcript was detected in 20 of the 25 ES/pPNET cases (80%). The 15 non-ES/pPNET control cases were negative for EWS-FLI1/ERG fusion transcript. Detection of EWS-FLI1/ERG fusion transcript is a reliable index for molecular diagnosis of ES/pPNET. One-step RT-PCR is a practical method for such analysis in routine paraffin-embedded tumor tissues.

Chromosomal translocations t(11;22) (q24;q12) are characteristic of about 80-90 % of Ewing's sarcoma family of tumors [bone and soft tissue Ewing's sarcoma and peripheral neuroectodermal tumors (PNET)]. They generate ews/fli1 rearrangements showing great diversity in breakpoint exon combination. In about 5 % of Ewing's tumors, ews is fused to the erg gene at 21q22. The various chimeric proteins encoded may function as aberrant oncogenic transcription factors. These specific translocations can be used for exact molecular diagnosis in these poorly differentiated small round-cell tumors. Moreover, the prognostic relevance of different translocational variants has been previously suggested. Furthermore, the sensitive molecular detection of minimal metastatic and residual disease and its clinical significance can be evaluated. To address these questions more definitively in the large number of patients registered in multicenter studies, it is often necessary to access archival paraffin-embedded tumor tissue if no fresh or frozen tumor material is available for analysis by RT (reverse transcription)-PCR. Specific problems arise from formalin-fixed and paraffin-embedded tissue due to the degradation of RNA and insufficient extraction efficiency. Therefore, primer distance and product size are limited for successful PCR amplification. This conflicts with the requirement for identification of various possible exon combinations by PCR simultaneously using one single primer pair with larger distance. We examined paraffin embedded soft part tumor tissue samples from 47 Ewing's tumor patients. Patients were treated according to either CWS (Cooperative Weichteilsarkomstudie, CWS-91 or CWS-96) or Euro-E.W.I.N.G. 99 therapy protocols. We established a novel RT-PCR method, using 3 different exon specific sets of PCR primer pairs, selected according to the coding ews and fli1 nucleotide sequences (NCBI database), suitable for RT-PCR identification of variant ews/fli1 fusion transcripts in RNA isolated from formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded tissue. For use in combination with ews -primer, an erg specific primer was selected to alternatively test for ews/erg fusion transcripts. As positive control for the integrity of isolated mRNA, we used the ubiquitously expressed gapdh transcript for RT-PCR amplification in each sample. In 31 cases (= 66 %) of 47 paraffin samples of Ewing's tumors analysed, gapdh control indicated adequate quality of RNA. In 16 cases no gapdh control fragment was amplifiable, nevertheless in 2 of these 16 samples distinct ews fusion products could be detected. In 23 cases we identified ews fusion transcripts. Thereof in 65 % ews exon 7 being fused to fli1 exon 6 (fusion type I), in 22 % to fli1 exon 5 (fusion type II). In 4 % each ews exon 10 being juxtaposed to fli1 either exon 6 or exon 5, respectively. An ews/erg fusion was detected in 4 % ( ews exon 7 fused to erg exon 6). In 10 samples, a gapdh fragment was amplified, but no ews/fli1 or - erg fusion transcript could be identified. The reference pathological review (I. L., Kiel, Germany) disproved the primary histopathology in 5 cases. Using our different sets of exon specific primer pairs, it was possible to detect 4 different breakpoints of ews/fli1 fusion transcripts and the ews/erg fusion by RT-PCR in RNA isolates from formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded Ewing's tumor tissue. This method can be a very useful alternative in clinical situations (to ensure diagnosis and perform minimal metastatic and residual disease investigations) and in order to assess prognostic significance of translocation subtypes when no fresh tumor tissue is available.
