What part of the body is affected by Meniere's disease?

[PMID: 29283101]
Ménière's Disease (MD) is a chronic, non-life threatening inner ear disease, with attacks of disabling vertigo, progressive hearing loss, and tinnitus as the major symptoms. All three symptoms, separately or in combination, cause great distress and have a considerable impact on the quality of life of the patients. The aims of this study were to develop a disease-specific quality of life survey for patients with MD and to analyze the relationships between the audiovestibular findings and the survey. Following Ear-Nose-Throat examination and audiovestibular tests, the Dokuz Eylül University Meniere's Disease Disability Scale (DEU-MDDS) and Turkish version of the Dizziness Handicap Inventory (DHI-T) were administered to 93 patients with definite MD. Reliability and validity analyses of the scale were performed. There were 45 (48.4%) male and 48 (51.6%) female patients and the mean age was 48.9±12.1 years. Cronbach's alpha was 0.92 and intraclass correlation coefficients of the DEU-MMDS were significant (p<0.001). Results of the Goodness of Fit Statistics showed that the expression levels of the items were high and the correlation coefficients of each item with the scale were sufficient. There was a statistically significant correlation between DHI-T scores and MDDS. DEU-MDDS was not related to the vestibular tests, age or gender (p>0.05). The MDDS is a valid and reliable scale as a disease-specific quality of life questionnaire for patients with MD.

Steroids have been widely used to treat inner-ear diseases such as sudden sensorineural hearing loss, tinnitus, and Meniere's disease. They can be given via either systemic or intratympanic (IT) injection. The purpose of the present study was to explore differences in intracochlear steroid distribution by the administration method employed (systemic vs. IT injection). Animal study. Twenty-three Sprague-Dawley rats were given fluorescein isothiocyanate-labeled dexamethasone (FITC-DEX) three times (on successive days) via intraperitoneal (IP) or IT injection. Cochlear uptake of FITC-DEX was evaluated via immunohistochemistry and flow cytometry at 6 hours, and 3 and 7 days after the final injection. FITC-DEX uptake was evident in spiral ganglion cells (SGs), the organ of Corti (OC), and the lateral walls (LWs), the basal turns of which were stained relatively prominently in both groups. Animals receiving IP injections exhibited higher FITC-DEX uptakes by the SGs and OC, whereas IT injection triggered higher-level FITC-DEX accumulation by the OC and LWs. Flow cytometry revealed that intracochlear FITC-DEX uptake by IT-injected animals was higher and more prolonged than in animals subjected to IP injections. We thus describe differences in cochlear steroid distributions after systemic and IT injections. This finding could help our understanding of the pharmacokinetics of steroids in the cochlea. NA.

Meniere's disease is an inner ear disease, characterized by recurrent rotatory vertigo, sensorineural hearing loss and tinnitus. There are some with frequent vertigo attacks, progressive hearing loss and persistent annoying tinnitus even through the continuous standard medical treatments. These cases are thought to account for 10%-20% of all cases of Meniere's disease. In this review article, we would like to demonstrate the evidences for surgical treatments according to the previous papers, and consider the next therapeutic strategies including surgical options according to the international guidelines.

Meniere's disease is a disease of the inner ear characterized by a triad of symptoms: vestibular symptoms, auditory symptoms, and pressure. The pathologic correlate of Meniere's disease is endolymphatic hydrops and the etiopathogenesis involves a deficiency in the absorption of endolymph. The pathophysiology of the symptoms is still disputed: membranous ruptures, pressure and mechanical displacement of the end organs, or obstruction followed by an abrupt clearance of the endolymphatic duct. The course of the disease may be progressive or nonprogressive and, in addition to the typical presentation of Meniere's disease, two variations of the disorder have been identified: cochlear Meniere's disease, and vestibular Meniere's disease. It can be further broken into two subsets: Meniere's syndrome, with a known and well-established cause, and Meniere's disease, in which the cause seems to be idiopathic. It is likely that there are racial (genetic) as well as environmental factors that influence differences in incidence among countries and among various sections of countries. The disease is much more common in adults, with an average age of onset in the fourth decade, the symptoms beginning usually between ages 20 and 60 years. Meniere's disease is (grossly) equally common in each sex, and right and left ears are affected with fairly equal frequency. The diagnosis of Meniere's disease is by exclusion, and a careful history is the most important guide to a correct diagnosis. Its medical treatment is largely empiric. Surgery can be considered when, even after medical therapy, the disease progresses and the symptoms become intractable. Surgery may be either conservative or destructive. Bilaterality must be considered when deciding the best surgical option for a patient with Meniere's disease. It is the authors' opinion that endolymphatic sac surgery is an extension of conservative treatment.

Blockage of the endolymphatic duct is a significant finding in Meniere's disease. The position of the utriculo-endolymphatic valve (UEV) and blockage of the ductus reuniens in the temporal bones were not found to be directly indicative of Meniere's disease. Comparison of blockage of the longitudinal flow of endolymph between ears affected by Meniere's disease and normal ears. We examined 21 temporal bones from 13 subjects who had Meniere's disease and 21 normal temporal bones from 12 controls. The endolymphatic duct was blocked in five (23%) ears affected by Meniere's disease (p = 0.016). The utricular duct was blocked in 16 (76%) ears affected by Meniere's disease and 11 (52%) normal ears (p = 0.112). The saccular duct was blocked in 6 (28%) of ears affected by Meniere's disease and 16 (76%) normal ears (p = 0.001). The ductus reuniens was blocked in 10 (47%) ears affected by Meniere's disease and 10 (47%) normal ears (p = 1.000).
