Which animal bite can cause Capnocytophaga canimorsus infection?

[PMID: 20407357]
Sudden and unexpected nontraumatic death in individuals with asplenia or hyposplenia is usually due to fulminant bacterial sepsis, most often involving Streptococcus pneumoniae, Neisseria meningitidis, and Hemophilus influenzae. We report a case of a previously well 40-year-old man who died 5 hours after hospital admission. At autopsy Waterhouse-Friderichsen syndrome was identified and Capnocytophaga canimorsus was subsequently isolated on antemortem blood cultures. Infection of humans with this organism is most often due to dog bite or contact. Upon specific inquiry it was ascertained that 2 days before admission the deceased had suffered a superficial bite to his hand by his pet Staffordshire Bullterrier dog. His relevant history included a previous splenectomy following blunt abdominal trauma. Asplenia and hyposplenia at autopsy should prompt microbiological testing with consideration of unusual organisms such as C. canimorsus. Although histories of animal contact or injury are often not available at the time of autopsy, this should also be considered in cases of apparent fulminant sepsis. In individuals with asplenia or hyposplenia, dog bites do not have to involve excessive tissue trauma, vascular compromise, or blood loss to be lethal.

Newly named in 1989, Capnocytophaga canimorsus is a bacterial pathogen found in the saliva of healthy dogs and cats, and is transmitted to humans principally by dog bites. This review compiled all laboratory-confirmed cases, animal sources, and virulence attributes to describe its epidemiology, clinical features, and pathogenesis. An estimated 484 patients with a median age of 55 years were reported, two-thirds of which were male. The case-fatality rate was about 26%. Its clinical presentations included severe sepsis and fatal septic shock, gangrene of the digits or extremities, high-grade bacteremia, meningitis, endocarditis, and eye infections. Predispositions were prior splenectomy in 59 patients and alcoholism in 58 patients. Dog bites before illness occurred in 60%; additionally, in 27%, there were scratches, licking, or other contact with dogs or cats. Patients with meningitis showed more advanced ages, higher male preponderance, lower mortality, and longer incubation periods after dog bites than patients with sepsis (p < 0.05). Patients with prior splenectomy presented more frequently with high-grade bacteremia than patients with intact spleens (p < 0.05). The organism possesses virulence attributes of catalase and sialidase production, gliding motility, cytotoxin production, and resistance to killing by serum complement due to its unique lipopolysaccharide. Penicillin is the drug of choice, but some practitioners prefer third-generation cephalosporins or beta-lactamase inhibitor combinations. C. canimorsus has emerged as a leading cause of sepsis, particularly post-splenectomy sepsis, and meningitis after dog bites.

Capnocytophaga canimorsus infections are associated with dog bites, especially in asplenic or immunocompromised patients, and typically manifest as sepsis and/or bacteremia. Meningitis has been rarely described, and its diagnosis may be delayed due to poor or slow growth using traditional culture techniques. We provide our experience using polymerase chain reaction (PCR) to establish the diagnosis and perform a comprehensive review of C. canimorsus meningitis cases to provide summary data on the clinical manifestations, diagnosis, and outcomes of this unusual infection. A systematic review of the peer-reviewed English literature (PubMed, Embase, Ovid Medline) from January 1966 to March 2018 was conducted to identify cases of C. canimorsus meningitis. Data collected included demographics, risk factors, cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) findings, PCR results, treatments, and outcomes. Descriptive statistics are presented as numbers (percentages) and medians (ranges). A total of 37 patients were reviewed with a median age of 63 years (12 days to 83 years) with a male predominance (76%). A relatively low proportion had an immunocompromised state (16% splenectomy and 5% steroid use); the most common risk factor was alcoholism (19%). Fifty-nine percent reported a dog bite (all within ≤ 14 days prior to presentation), while 22% reported a non-bite dog exposure, 3% reported cat bite, and 3% reported both dog and cat exposures; 11% reported no animal contact. CSF parameters included a median white count of 1024 cells/mm<sup>3</sup>, 81% had neutrophilic predominance, median protein of 190 mg/dl, and median glucose CSF/serum ratio 0.23. In 54% of cases, blood cultures were positive for C. canimorsus (median, 4 days) and 70% had positive CSF cultures (median, 5 days). PCR established the diagnosis in eight (22%) cases. Antibiotic therapy was given for a median of 15 days (range, 7 to 42 days). Prognosis was overall favorable with only one (3%) death reported and adverse neurologic and/or physical sequelae in 19% of the survivors. C. canimorsus meningitis is a rare but increasingly important clinical entity occurring in patients of all ages, typically after dog exposure. While classically considered an infection among immunocompromised patients, most cases have occurred in previously healthy, immunocompetent persons. Diagnosis may be rapidly established by PCR, and this test should be considered in culture-negative cases with associated exposures. Outcome was generally favorable after a median antibiotic duration of 15 days.

Capnocytophaga canimorsus was cultured from an infected, dog-inflicted bite wound in a pet rabbit. The wound was treated successfully and the rabbit recovered. To our knowledge, this is the first report of a C. canimorsus infection in a species other than humans.

<i>Capnocytophaga</i> species are gram-negative bacilli that inhabit mammalian oral surfaces and can cause opportunistic infection, especially in asplenic patients. The species <i>Capnocytophaga canimorsus</i> is particularly associated with dog bites and is known to cause endocarditis, meningitis, and sepsis in the general population. In pregnant patients, infections tied to <i>Capnocytophaga</i> species from human flora have been associated with preterm labor, chorioamnionitis, and neonatal septicemia. There is little known about the effects of zoonotically-acquired <i>Capnocytophaga</i> infection in pregnant patients. In this case report, we present a patient with <i>Capnocytophaga</i> bacteremia acquired after a dog bite associated with profound thrombocytopenia and preterm labor. Dog bites are common in the United States, and we present basic recommendations for management of dog bites in pregnant patients in order to avoid morbidity associated with delay in time to antibiotic treatment of infection as described in this case.

<i>Capnocytophaga canimorsus</i> is a Gram-negative bacilli that is part of the normal oral flora of dogs and some cats; it is well known to cause septicemia and endocarditis after their bite. This is the first reported case of infective endocarditis affecting both native mitral and aortic valves after a lion bite in a patient with heavy ethanol consumption, who ultimately died after valve replacements.

C. canimorsus and C. cynodegmi are dog and cat commensals which can be transmitted to humans via bites or scratches and can cause sepsis, meningitis, endocarditis, and eye- or wound infections. Recently an additional Capnocytophaga species was identified as part of the oral flora of healthy dogs and was given the name "C. canis". We previously identified a Capnocytophaga isolate that could not be typed with available diagnostic tests including MALDI-TOF, 16S rRNA sequencing or species-specific PCR. This strain and 21 other Capnocytophaga spp isolated in Sweden from clinical blood- or wound-cultures were subjected to whole genome sequencing using the Illumina platform. Phylogenetic analysis revealed that the previously non-typable isolate belongs to the putative new species "C. canis". Since this strain was isolated from a wound it also shows that members of "C. canis" have the potential to be pathogenic. In addition, our phylogenetic analysis uncovered an additional species of Capnocytophaga, which can be transmitted from dogs and cats to humans, suggesting a speciation within the Capnocytophaga family that has not been observed before. We propose the name of "C. stomatis" for this putative novel species.

The authors describe a fatal case of purpura fulminans with symmetrical peripheral gangrene and sepsis caused by Capnocytophaga canimorsus in a 45-year-old, previously healthy woman who was bitten by a dog at an animal shelter where she was employed. Absent in this patient were the usual risk factors, including immunosuppression, alcohol abuse, corticosteroid therapy, and splenectomy. The patient's presentation to the emergency room late in the course of the infection probably effected her death. C canimorsus should be strongly suspected in any case of septicemia following a dog bite. Prompt therapy may influence the potentially fatal course of systemic infection. Employees and/or volunteers who work in animal shelters should be cognizant of the potential risks of a dog or cat bite and follow recommended procedures when such an incident occurs.

The gram-negative bacteria known as Capnocytophaga canimorsus (C. canimorsus) is found in dog saliva and rarely can cause severe infection in humans following a bite or scratch. There has previously been just a single case described in the literature of Acute Acalculous Cholecystitis (AAC) secondary to C. canimorsus. Here we describe the second ever published case of C. canimorsus bacteremia presenting with acute cholecystitis. The patient presented with epigastric pain and sepsis three weeks post domestic dog bite. On further examination, he was Murphy's sign positive. Investigations included blood cultures, Ultrasound Scan and Computed Tomography of the Abdomen. He was treated with intravenous fluid resuscitation, and intravenous ceftriaxone and metronidazole. He required an extended course of antibiotics for complete symptom resolution. His blood cultures were positive for C. Canimorsus. This case highlights the ever-present need for thorough history and examination, and consideration of prolonged antibiotics for cases of cholecystitis that could be secondary to C. canimorsus bacteremia. We strongly advocate blood cultures in patients who present with abdominal pain and sepsis, particularly when they have a recent history of animal bite. In cases of cholecystitis secondary to C. canimorsus it may be necessary to monitor the patient's progress more closely and treat with prolonged targeted antibiotic therapy.

The hemolytic uremic syndrome (HUS) is known to have several causes, including infectious diseases, drugs, pregnancy, and malignant disease. We report a patient who developed acute renal failure attributable to HUS in the course of Capnocytophaga canimorsus bacteremia. Acute tubular necrosis as well as HUS should be considered as a cause of acute renal failure in the setting of Capnocytophaga canimorsus bacteremia.

Capnocytophaga canimorsus causes dog-bite wound induced sepsis in adults, but infection may follow mucous membrane exposure. Systemic infection in children is extremely rare. A neonate with frequent exposure to a family dog and no cutaneous infection developed C. canimorsus meningitis. Suspicion of this pathogen requires laboratory consultation. Parental counseling can limit the risk of pet acquired infections.

Capnocytophaga canimorsus is a gram-negative, capnophilic rod constituting normal bacterial flora of the oral cavity of dogs and cats. It is also considered to be an etiological factor of infections in human that may lead to multiple complications, i.a. sepsis, endocarditis and meningitis. C. canimorsus poses a serious threat, especially to patients with asplenia, cirrhosis or alcohol abuse. In most cases, infection occurs after a dog bite. Isolation and identification of the bacteria from the biological material is difficult and often delayed because of slow growth of the bacteria on microbiological media. Gold standard for bacteriological identification of C. canimorsus is polymerase chain reaction method. Amoxicillin with clavulanic acid is considered the drug of choice used in prophylaxis of C. canimorsus infections. Based on the data available from the literature, the authors present the epidemiology, risk factors, clinical picture, diagnostic methods and treatment of the C. canimorsus infection.

A diagnosis of myocardial infarction is made using a combination of clinical presentation, electrocardiogram and cardiac biomarkers. However, myocardial infarction can be caused by factors other than coronary artery plaque rupture and thrombosis. We describe an interesting case presenting with hypertensive emergency and type 2 myocardial infarction resulting from Pheochromocytoma associated with Capnocytophaga canimorsus infection from a dog bite. We also review current literature on the management of hypertensive emergency and Pheochromocytoma.

We describe a case of a life-threatening septicemia resulting from a previous dog bite wound. The isolated bacterium was Capnocytophaga canimorsus, a slow-growing Gram-negative bacillus commonly found in dog saliva. Known risk factors for invasive C. canimorsus infections are alcohol abuse, cigarette smoking, splenectomy or other forms of immunosuppression. Any clinician seeing patients with a history of a dog bite should consider this pathogen as a causative agent and take detailed history regarding exposure to animals.

[PMID: 18366884]
Capnocytophaga canimorsus has been recognized as an opportunistic pathogen causing systemic infections in immunocompromised individuals. It is part of the normal oral flora of the dog, and can be responsible for localized wound infections in humans in consequence of bites. This microorganism causes also septicemia, meningitis, endocarditis, ocular infections and rarely brain abscess. We describe the case of an immunocompetent 28-year-old male with temporal brain abscess from Capnocytophaga canimorsus secondary to dog's bite.

A 66-year-old man developed a hemolytic uremic syndrome (HUS) with acute renal failure, thrombocytopenia, fragmented red cells in the blood film and elevated serum LDH following a capnocytophaga canimorsus (DF-2) infection after a dog bite. He was treated with antibiotics, plasmapheresis and hemodialysis. Although hematologic values improved, the patient remained hemodialysis-dependent for six months. In the literature several cases of renal failure following capnocytophaga canimorsus septicemia have been described, caused by hypotension or disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC). In our patient there were no signs of hypotension or extensive DIC. A few case reports described HUS and thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura (TTP) following DF-2 sepsis.

Animal bites are typically harmless, but in rare cases infections introduced by such bites can be fatal. Capnocytophaga canimorsus, found in the normal oral flora of dogs, has the potential to cause conditions ranging from minor cellulitis to fatal sepsis. The tendency of C. canimorsus infections to present with varied symptoms, the organism's fastidious nature, and difficulty of culturing make this a challenging diagnosis. Rarely, bacterial cytotoxins such as those produced by C. canimorsus may act as causative agents of TTP, further complicating the diagnosis. Early recognition is crucial for survival, and the variability of presentation must be appreciated. We present the first known case of C. canimorsus infection resulting in TTP that initially presented as splenic infarction. 72-year-old Caucasian male presented with a four-day history of abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, and intermittent confusion. On presentation, vital signs were stable and the patient was afebrile. Physical examination was unremarkable apart from petechiae on the inner left thigh, and extreme diffuse abdominal pain to palpation and percussion along with positive rebound tenderness. Initial investigations revealed leukocytosis with left shift and thrombocytopenia, but normal liver enzymes, cardiac enzymes, lipase, INR and PTT. Abdominal CT demonstrated a non-enhancing spleen and hemoperitoneum, suggesting complete splenic infarction. Although the patient remained afebrile, he continued deteriorating over the next two days with worsening thrombocytopenia. After becoming febrile, he developed microangiopathic hemolytic anemia and hemodynamic instability, and soon after was intubated due to hypoxic respiratory failure and decreased consciousness. Plasma exchange was initiated but subsequently stopped when positive blood cultures grew a gram-negative organism. The patient progressively improved following therapy with piperacillin-tazobactam, which was switched to imipenem, then meropenem when Capnocytophaga was identified. There is a common misconception amongst practitioners that the presence of systemic infection excludes the possibility of TTP and vice versa. This case emphasizes that TTP may occur secondary to a systemic infection, thereby allowing the two processes to coexist. It is important to maintain a wide differential when considering the diagnosis of either TTP or C. canimorsus infection since delays in treatment may have fatal consequences.

Dog bites are the most common animal bite injuries occurring in the United States. Estimated infection rates range between 15% and 20%. Polymicrobial infections are most common. Capnocytophaga canimorsus (C. canimorsus) is a Gram-negative rod strongly associated with dog bites, and is known to cause life-threatening infection in humans. 1) Outline epidemiology of dog bites in the United States; 2) Identify host factors associated with infection, and common pathogens; 3) Discuss microbiology of C. canimorsus; 4) Discuss common clinical manifestations of C. canimorsus infection; 5) Outline treatment options. A 42-year-old woman with a remote history of Hodgkin's lymphoma (treated with irradiation) and thyroid carcinoma, both of which were in remission, presented to the Emergency Department with fever, abdominal pain, and diarrhea. She was found to be in septic shock. She was aggressively resuscitated and administered broad-spectrum antibiotics. Blood cultures grew C. canimorsus in 2/4 bottles. The patient recalled being bitten by the family dog 48 h before her initial presentation. She made an uneventful recovery. She was felt to be "functionally hyposplenic" due to her prior irradiation. C. canimorsus is a rare pathogen strongly associated with dog bites. By eliciting a history of animal bite, clinicians may be able to alert the laboratory of suspected C. canimorsus infection. Prolonged laboratory incubation times may be necessary as the organism is fastidious. Predisposing conditions include, among others, prior splenectomy and alcoholism. The mortality rate from C. canimorsus sepsis is high, so treatment should be promptly initiated.

CDC group DF-2 is the vernacular name given to a slow-growing gram-negative bacterium that causes septicemia and meningitis in humans. Infections frequently (one-third of cases) occur following dog bites or close contact with dogs or occasionally with cats. Splenectomy and alcoholism appear to be strong predisposing factors for DF-2 infection. In addition to 150 DF-2 strains received for identification, we received 9 DF-2-like strains; 6 were isolated from wound or eye infections, 3 of which were associated with dog bites and 1 of which was associated with a cat scratch, and 3 were isolated from dog mouths. The major characteristics of DF-2 include production of acid but no gas from lactose and maltose and usually D-glucose; positive reactions for oxidase, catalase, arginine dihydrolase, gliding motility, and o-nitrophenyl-beta-D-galactopyranoside; growth enhanced by serum and by incubation in a candle jar atmosphere; and negative reactions for sucrose, raffinose, inulin, melibiose, nitrate reduction, indole, and growth on MacConkey agar. DF-2-like strains had the same characteristics, except that acid was formed from sucrose, raffinose, inulin, and melibiose. By the hydroxyapatite method, DNAs from 12 DF-2 strains were 88% related in 60 degrees C reactions and 84% related in 75 degrees C reactions. Related sequences contained 0.5 to 1.5% unpaired bases (divergence). Three DF-2-like strains were 73 to 80% related at 60 degrees C (with 2.0 to 2.5% divergence) and 68 to 75% related at 75 degrees C. The relatedness of DF-2 and DF-2-like strains was 19 to 31% at 60 degrees Celsius and 13 to 19% at 75 degrees Celsius. The relatedness of DF-2 and DF-2-like strains to Capnocytophaga species was 4 to 7%. The DNA relatedness date indicate that eh DF-2 and the DF-2-like strains are separate, previously undescribed species. Both groups are phenotypically and genetically distinct from Capnocytophaga species, although they do share several characteristics with Capnocytophaga species, including cellular morphology, gliding motility, cellular fatty acid composition, enhancement of growth in a candle jar atmosphere, and G+C content. The new species differ from Capnocytophaga species by their positive oxidase and catalase reactions. We chose to avoid creating a new genus and proposed the names Capnocytophaga canimorsus sp. nov. for group DF-2 and C. cynodegmi sp. nov. for the DF-2-like strains.

Capnocytophaga canimorsus is part of normal gingival flora of dogs and cats. The organism can cause septicemia, meningitis, and endocarditis in humans after contact with dogs or cats. In spite of the frequency of gastrointestinal symptoms in C. canimorsus infection patients, specific gastrointestinal disease or clinical images have not been reported. We report a case of C. canimorsus bacteremia presenting with acute cholecystitis in elderly woman. She suffered from general fatigue and right upper abdominal pain. She had leukocytosis and abnormal liver function tests. She showed abnormal findings of the gallbladder by abdominal computed tomography and ultrasonography. She was diagnosed with acute cholecystitis without gallstones and was administered with antibiotics. C. canimorsus was isolated from blood cultures. A history of an insignificant wound secondary to a dog bite was elicited. She recovered completely with antibiotic treatment. This case revealed that C. canimorsus bacteremia can be presented with acute cholecystitis, suggesting that C. canimorsus could cause cholecystitis. And this cholecystitis can be treated with antibiotics without operation. Physicians seeing patients with acute cholecysitis should ask questions regarding animal contact.

Capnocytophaga canimorsus is a commensal bacterium found in the saliva of dogs and cats. Clinically significant infections in humans after a bite are often associated with the presence of immune deficiency. Early recognition and appropriate treatment are crucial for patient survival. In addition, patients with immune deficiency are susceptible to serious life-threatening nosocomial infections, which may also influence the prognosis of patients with Capnocytophaga canimorsus infection. A 62-year-old Caucasian female was admitted with septic shock, acute respiratory distress syndrome, acute renal failure, metabolic acidosis and disseminated intravascular coagulation after suffering two small bites from her dog. She had received a splenectomy during childhood. The patient survived after early empiric treatment with antibiotics and intensive supportive care, including ventilation support, a high dose of noradrenalin, and continuous venovenous hemodialysis applied prior to the definitive diagnosis of Capnocytophaga canimorsus sepsis. She improved within 2 weeks but, despite all efforts to prevent nosocomial infection, her hospital course was complicated by Enterococcus species and Candida albicans pleuropneumonia that prolonged her stay in the intensive care unit, and necessitated ventilation support for 2 months. Severe Capnocytophaga canimorsus sepsis may be complicated by life-threatening nosocomial infection in immunocompromized patients. The prophylactic application of antibiotics after a dog bite should be considered in high-risk individuals with immune deficiency in order to prevent both Capnocytophyga canimorsus sepsis and serious nosocomial complications.

Capnocytophaga canimorsus is a commensal bacterium from the canine oral flora, which can cause septicemia or meningitis in humans upon bite wound infections. C. canimorsus 5 (Cc5), a strain isolated from a patient with fatal septicemia, was used to investigate the interaction between C. canimorsus and J774.1 mouse macrophages. J774.1 cells infected at high multiplicity with Cc5 did not phagocytose nor kill Cc5 within 120 min of infection, unless the bacteria were opsonized with specific antibodies. Opsonization with complement, however, did not increase phagocytosis. Moreover, infection of J774.1 cells with live Cc5 led to the release of a soluble factor, which interfered with the ability of macrophages to kill other phagocytosed bacteria. These results provide an example of how C. canimorsus neutralizes the innate immune system.

<i>Capnocytophaga canimorsus</i> is a gram-negative rod that can be transmitted primarily by dog bites. This life-threatening organism commonly causes sepsis in patients with splenectomy or alcoholism. A 53-year-old rheumatoid arthritis male treated with methotrexate (MTX) for 5 years was admitted for a 4-day history of fever and dyspnea. He had been bitten on a finger by the family dog 4 days before onset. Laboratory tests revealed pancytopenia, acute renal failure, and evidence of disseminated intravascular coagulation, and he subsequently developed acute respiratory distress syndrome. Furthermore, blood cultures grew gram-negative bacilli and despite intensive treatment, he died 5 days after admission. Later, <i>C. canimorsus</i> was identified from his culture samples using a species-specific polymerase chain reaction. <i>C. canimorsus</i> infections should be considered in the differential diagnosis of sepsis for immunocompromised hosts following animal bites.

Capnocytophaga canimorsus, commonly transmitted by dog bites, can cause severe sepsis, and the mortality rate is very high. We experienced a case of hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis (HLH) complicated by severe sepsis caused by C. canimorsus. A 58-year-old man with no remarkable medical history was admitted to another hospital with fever and mild consciousness disorder developed 3 days after being bitten by his dog. The next day, the patient developed disseminated intravascular coagulation and shock and was transferred to our emergency medical center. Blood tests showed hyperferritinemia and cytopenia, and bone marrow aspiration was performed. As a result, we diagnosed severe sepsis and HLH. Once antibiotic and steroid therapy was started, the patient's infection and cytopenia improved. Unfortunately, the patient's fingers and toes required amputation, but his life was saved, and he was discharged from hospital. Because HLH may be hidden in such cases, it may be necessary to measure serum ferritin and perform bone marrow aspiration if hyperferritinemia is suspected.

Capnocytophaga canimorsus is a gram-negative bacterial species hosted in the oral cavity of dogs. C. canimorsus can cause sepsis, meningitis and endocarditis. Penicillin is the drug of choice. However, the species is a slow-grower and sometimes missed in blood cultures. Patients with a history of alcoholism, splenectomy or immunodeficiency are at an increased risk of contracting serious infections with C. canimorsus following dog bites. We report a case story of C. canimorsus meningitis contracted after a dog bite.

[PMID: 29523423]
Capnocytophaga canimorsus is a bacterium of the normal oral flora of dogs and cats. Human infection is caused by animal bite but is rarely observed, mainly in immunocompromised patients. We present 2 cases of C. canimorsus infection that occurred in immunocompetent patients and caused multiorgan failure and in both cases severe neurologic involvement. In the first case, we present a 69-year-old immunocompetent woman with septic shock derived from skin and soft tissue infection after a dog's bite. She developed ischemic necrosis evolving to gangrene of both forefeet and hands, infective aortic endocarditis, and neurologic involvement caused by large hemispheric hypodense lesions compatible with ischemic septical lesions. In the second case, we present a 65-year-old immunocompetent man with meningitis after a dog's bite. Despite antibiotic therapy, he developed neurologic clinical deterioration, with right sensitive hemisyndrome associated with lack of strength and motor skills of the right hand. Radiologic findings were consistent with the diagnosis of cerebritis. WHY SHOULD AN EMERGENCY PHYSICIAN BE AWARE OF THIS?: Clinicians should always be aware of this pathogen, both in immunocompromised and immunocompetent patients, and consider prophylactic antibiotics after exposure.

A 70-year-old Caucasian woman was treated for Capnocytophaga canimorsus septicaemia. The source of bacteraemia was very likely to be her household pet, an Italian greyhound. The patient presented with a presumed complex partial seizure but deteriorated rapidly with sepsis and multiorgan dysfunction. Neither scratch nor bite was established, although close petting including licks was reported. Blood cultures grew Gram-negative rods, identified by molecular techniques as C. canimorsus-a bacterium frequently isolated in the oral cavities of dogs and cats. A full recovery was made following 2 weeks of intensive care support and broad-spectrum antibiotics. No underlying immune dysfunction was found.

Capnocytophaga canimorsus is a fastidious, slow-growing, gram-negative, rod-shaped bacterium that belongs to the normal oral flora of dogs and cats. Human septicemic infections are associated with a high mortality; most cases occur in immunocompromised patients with a history of dog bite. The fifth case of cat-associated septicemia caused by Capnocytophaga canimorsus is described. The six case reports presented here point out the characteristics reported previously: (a) cats are a source of human infection; (b) alcohol abuse is an important risk factor for the development of septicemic Capnocytophaga canimorsus infection; (c) septicemic infection often manifests with disseminated intravascular consumption coagulopathy or purpura; and (d) some cases of septicemia in humans result from pets that lick skin ulcers.

Described in this study is the case of a 53-year-old woman who developed a life-threatening infection caused by the bacterium Capnocytophaga canimorsus (C. canimorsus), subsequent to being bitten by a dog. The patient presented to an Emergency Department with a 24-h history of diarrhoea and vomiting with dehydration but within 36 h of presentation developed an overwhelming severe sepsis with septic shock, disseminated intravascular coagulation, acute renal failure, metabolic acidosis and threatened acute respiratory failure requiring urgent intensive care intervention. At subsequent questioning her husband volunteered that she had been bitten on the wrist by the family dog 24h prior to the onset of symptoms; this bite had been extremely minor, requiring no treatment at the time and leaving only a very superficial wound. The causative organism was finally identified two weeks later as C. canimorsus, a common commensal in the oral flora of dogs. C. canimorsus has been reported as a rare cause of severe infection in susceptible individuals; however this case is of particular interest as there were no apparent predisposing factors conferring risk of severe infection. This case also raised significant practice issues for the treating hospital.

Animal bites represent a significant global health problem and account for approximately 1-2% of all visits to the emergency department. The vast majority of animal bite injuries are inflicted by dogs (80-90%,) and cats (5-15%). The most common complication following an animal bite is a wound infection, which tends to be polymicrobial and include both aerobic and anaerobic bacteria mainly of oropharyngeal origin. The likelihood of a cat bite becoming infected is double of that of a dog bite. Pasteurella spp. predominates in infected dog and cat bites. Dog bite injuries can be also associated with Capnocytophaga canimorsus, an aggressive organism which can cause disseminated infections (sepsis) and death, particularly in immunocompromised individuals. Early aggressive local wound cleansing is the most important therapy to prevent infection after animal bites. Due to the polymicrobial etiology of infected bite wounds, broad-spectrum antibiotics, covering both aerobic and anerobic bacteria, are often recommended as empiric treatment of animal bites.

Capnocytophaga canimorsus, a commensal bacterium from dogs' mouths, can cause septicemia or meningitis in humans through bites or scratches. Here, we describe and characterize the inflammatory response of human and mouse macrophages on C. canimorsus infection. Macrophages infected with 10 different strains failed to release tumor necrosis factor (TNF)- alpha and interleukin (IL)-1 alpha . Macrophages infected with live and heat-killed (HK) C. canimorsus 5 (Cc5), a strain isolated from a patient with fatal septicemia, did not release IL-6, IL-8, interferon- gamma , macrophage inflammatory protein-1 beta , and nitric oxide (NO). This absence of a proinflammatory response was characterized by the inability of Toll-like receptor (TLR) 4 to respond to Cc5. Moreover, live but not HK Cc5 blocked the release of TNF- alpha and NO induced by HK Yersinia enterocolitica. In addition, live Cc5 down-regulated the expression of TLR4 and dephosphorylated p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase. These results highlight passive and active mechanisms of immune evasion by C. canimorsus, which may explain its capacity to escape from the host immune system.

Bite infections caused by <i>Capnocytophaga canimorsus</i> are rare. Severe and fatal infections are more frequently reported in patients with immunodeficiency, splenectomy or alcohol abuse. We describe the case of a 63-year-old man who developed flu-like symptoms and presented after some delay with severe sepsis and purpura fulminans. He was found to be infected with <i>C. canimorsus</i> without a bite injury and did not demonstrate immunodeficiency or any other typical predisposition. Despite extensive intensive care, his conditions deteriorated and he died from multiorgan failure. Pet owners with banal, for instance flu-like, symptoms should urgently seek medical advice when symptoms are unusual.<i>Capnocytophaga canimorsus</i> infection should be considered and empirical antibiotic therapy immediately started or adjusted in the presence of purpura fulminans in the absence of animal bites or immunodeficiency.
