What organism causes Rhombencephalitis?

[PMID: 24050079]
Listeria monocytogenes is a gram-positive bacillus that exhibits predilection to infect the central nervous system in immunocompromised individuals; the most common manifestations are meningitis and rhombencephalitis. Listerial brain abscesses are rare. We report here two brain abscess cases caused by L. monocytogenes in patients receiving immunosuppressive agents. The first patient presented with left hemiparesis mimicking stroke and the second patient presented with neurological symptoms without fever, which was indistinguishable from brain tumor. In both cases, magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS) was performed to differentiate infectious processes from other causes. Diagnosis was made with a positive blood culture in both cases. Listerial DNA was detected in the pus aspirated from the abscess in the first case. Both patients were successfully treated with intravenous ampicillin followed by oral amoxicillin. MRS was useful in differentiating infectious processes from non-infectious causes.

Listeria monocytogenes is associated with rhombencephalitis. However, the exact mechanisms of brainstem invasion remains poorly understood. Here, we demonstrate clinical and radiological data suggesting that Listeria may invade the brainstem via the trigeminal nerve. Three females (41, 64 and 70 years) with culture proven L. monocytogenes bacteremia and rhombencephalitis were investigated in the period of 2014-16. T2-weighted and contrast-enhanced T1-weighted MRI revealed a cerebellopontine abscess in all three patients, including the involvement of the trigeminal nerve root. In two patients, MRI also revealed selective contrast enhancement of the sensory trigeminal tract in the pons and medulla oblongata. Prior to any other neurological symptoms, two patients complained of hypoesthesia and a tingling sensation in the ipsilateral half of the face, consistent with sensory trigeminal nerve dysfunction on that side. In addition, we identified another 120 cases of Listeria rhombencephalitis following a systematic review. Cranial nerves VII, V, IX, and X, respectively, medulla oblongata, cerebellum and pons, were the most frequently involved brain structures. The present clinical and radiological findings corroborate earlier data from animal experiments, indicating that L. monocytogenes may be capable of retrograde intra-axonal migration along the cranial nerves. We suggest that in a subset of patients with rhombencephalitis L. monocytogenes enters the cerebellopontine angle through the trigeminal nerve, invading the brainstem via the sensory trigeminal nuclei.

Rhombencephalitis due to Listeria monocytogenes is a frequent complication of human listeriosis, inducing a high mortality and severe neurological sequelae despite antibiotic therapy. However, there is no animal model which consistently reproduces clinical rhombencephalitis. Here, we present a model of Listeria rhombencephalitis in gerbils. Animals were inoculated in the middle ears with a low infective dose of L. monocytogenes, thus creating prolonged otitis media with persistent bacteremia. Gerbils developed a severe rhombencephalitis with circling syndrome, paresia, ataxia, rolling movements. The invasion of the central nervous system was visualized on living animals by resonance magnetic imaging and characterized by bacterial growth in the brain, reaching about 10(7) bacteria in the rhombencephalum by day 12 of infection. The histological lesions were mainly located in the brainstem, and consisted in coalescent, necrotic abscesses with perivascular sheaths, mimicking those observed in human rhombencephalitis. Bacteria were detected by electronmicroscopy inside infectious foci, either free in necrotic material or inside inflammatory cells, mainly polymorphonuclear cells. This gerbil model of Listeria rhombencephalitis will be useful to study the molecular mechanisms allowing bacteria to cross the blood-brain barrier, and to evaluate the intracerebral efficacy of antibiotics.

Listeriosis is an emerging zoonotic infection of humans and ruminants worldwide caused by Listeria monocytogenes (LM). In both host species, CNS disease accounts for the high mortality associated with listeriosis and includes rhombencephalitis, whose neuropathology is strikingly similar in humans and ruminants. This review discusses the current knowledge about listeric encephalitis, and involved host and bacterial factors. There is an urgent need to study the molecular mechanisms of neuropathogenesis, which are poorly understood. Such studies will provide a basis for the development of new therapeutic strategies that aim to prevent LM from invading the brain and spread within the CNS.

Infection of the central nervous system due to Listeria monocytogenes is uncommon. The treatment of choice is ampicillin. We describe in this report a case of rhombencephalitis caused by Listeria monocytogenes successfully treated with linezolid. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first case in which linezolid was used to treat infection of the central nervous system caused by this organism.

Rhombencephalitis (RE) is a syndrome of multiple causes and multiple outcomes. Most authors now use the terms "rhombencephalitis" and "brainstem encephalitis" interchangeably even though anatomically they are slightly different. The etiologic categories of RE include infections, autoimmune diseases, and paraneoplastic syndromes (PNS). Listeria is the most common cause of infectious RE. Listeria RE primary occurs in healthy young adults. It usually occurs as a biphasic time course with a flu-like syndrome followed by brainstem dysfunction; 75% of patients have a cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) pleocytosis, and almost 100% have an abnormal brain MRI scan. Positive CSF and blood cultures are the most specific for diagnosis. Treatment primarily is with ampicillin. Enterovirus 71 is probably the second most common infectious cause of RE; however, 95% of cases have occurred in the Asian-Pacific region and there is no specific treatment. Herpes simplex virus (HSV) is the third most common infectious cause of RE, and about 80% of cases are caused by HSV1 and 20% by HSV2. About 50% only had involvement of the brainstem whereas the other 50% also had supratentorial involvement of the temporal and frontal lobes. Mortality with acyclovir treatment was 22% versus those not on acyclovir 75%. Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) and human herpesvirus 6 (HHV6) have caused a few cases. The most common autoimmune etiology is Behçet disease. Over 90% of those with Behçet RE had abnormal MRI scans and 94% had a CSF pleocytosis. Treatment is with corticosteroids and immunosuppressive agents, but only 25% have complete recovery. Paraneoplastic causes are the third category of RE. Brain MRIs are usually normal; there is usually a CSF pleocytosis but the protein is usually normal. Often anti-neuronal antibodies can be found. Prognosis is poor and treatment is only partially beneficial. Because Listeria and HSV are the most common treatable acute causes of RE, we recommend empiric therapy with ampicillin and acyclovir for all cases after samples have been obtained from CSF and blood for cultures and the polymerase chain reaction (PCR). Antibiotics can be changed based upon MRI, culture results, PCR results, and antibody studies.

A pastured 2-y-old cross-breed bull developed brainstem encephalitis (rhombencephalitis); Listeria monocytogenes was isolated from the brain. In the brainstem, there was perivascular cuffing, multiple microabscesses, and positive immunostaining for L. monocytogenes. Samples of bovine feces, water, feedstuffs, milking parlor soil, and bulk tank milk were collected from the dairy farm. Seven isolates of the genus Listeria were obtained, 6 of L. innocua and 1 of L. monocytogenes, which was found in the pasture where the bull grazed. Both isolates belonged to serotype 4b and were positive for internalins A, C, and J. According to the DNA fragment patterns of pulsed-field gel electrophoresis, the isolates were closely related. The source of infection was the pasture, implying that listeriosis should not be discounted in cases with compatible clinical signs but the absence of silage feeding.

Listeria rhombencephalitis is caused by infection with Listeria monocytogenes and is associated with a high mortality rate in humans and ruminants. Little is known about the metabolic changes associated with neurolisteriosis in particular and infectious central nervous system (CNS) diseases in general. The purpose of our study was to investigate the metabolic changes associated with listeria rhombencephalitis in small ruminants (goats and sheep) as a model for inflammatory CNS disease by <sup>1</sup> H high-resolution magic angle spinning nuclear magnetic resonance (<sup>1</sup> H HR-MAS NMR) spectroscopy of brain biopsies obtained from the brainstem and thalamus. Statistical analysis revealed distinct differences in the metabolic profile of brainstem biopsies, the primary location of listeria rhombencephalitis with moderate or severe inflammatory changes. N-Acetylaspartate (NAA), N-acetylaspartylglutamate, choline, myo-inositol and scyllo-inositol were decreased, and glycine, phosphocholine, taurine and lactate were increased, in the diseased group (n = 13) in comparison with the control group (n = 12). In the thalamus, which showed no or only mild inflammatory changes in the majority of animals, no statistically significant metabolic changes were observed. However, trends for metabolic alterations were partly the same as those found in the brainstem, including NAA, choline and lactate. This may be an indicator of metabolic changes occurring in the early stages of the disease. Therefore, further research with a larger number of animals is needed to evaluate the presence of subtle metabolic changes associated with mild inflammatory changes in the thalamus. In conclusion, <sup>1</sup> H HR-MAS NMR investigation of listeria rhombencephalitis identified brain metabolite changes, offering new insights into the disease pathophysiology.

A 46-year-old previously healthy man presented with 1 week of headache, nausea, vomiting and dizziness. He was found to have cranial nerve deficits, his cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) demonstrated a lymphocytic pleocytosis and brain MRI suggested rhombencephalitis. Although Gram stains and cultures of his CSF did not identify a pathogen, <i>Listeria monocytogenes</i> DNA was detected by the FilmArray Meningitis/Encephalitis panel within 2 hours of performing a lumbar puncture. He was treated with ampicillin and gentamicin and had a near-complete recovery. This case highlights the importance of recognising <i>L. monocytogenes</i> infection as a cause of acute cranial nerve impairment with MRI findings suggestive of brainstem encephalitis. It also highlights the frequently atypical CSF profile and low yield of culture in <i>L. monocytogenes</i> rhombencephalitis and the value of multiplex PCR testing of CSF to rapidly identify this pathogen and permit targeted therapy.

The term rhombencephalitis refers to inflammatory diseases affecting the hindbrain (brainstem and cerebellum). Rhombencephalitis has a wide variety of etiologies, including infections, autoimmune diseases, and paraneoplastic syndromes. Infection with bacteria of the genus <i>Listeria</i> is the most common cause of rhombencephalitis. Primary rhombencephalitis caused by infection with <i>Listeria</i> spp. occurs in healthy young adults. It usually has a biphasic time course with a flu-like syndrome, followed by brainstem dysfunction; 75% of patients have cerebrospinal fluid pleocytosis, and nearly 100% have an abnormal brain magnetic resonance imaging scan. However, other possible causes of rhombencephalitis must be borne in mind. In addition to the clinical aspects, the patterns seen in magnetic resonance imaging can be helpful in defining the possible cause. Some of the reported causes of rhombencephalitis are potentially severe and life threatening; therefore, an accurate initial diagnostic approach is important to establishing a proper early treatment regimen. This pictorial essay reviews the various causes of rhombencephalitis and the corresponding magnetic resonance imaging findings, by describing illustrative confirmed cases.

Listeria monocytogenes is a gram-positive bacillus which causes sporadic infections in immunocompromised humans, with a special propensity for the central nervous system, in the form of acute, subacute or chronic meningitis, rhombencephalitis or abscesses in the brain or spinal cord. The final diagnosis is established by germ culture in blood or in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF). Preferred treatment is ampicillin in association with aminoglycosides. We report the case of a 70-year-old male patient with a history of arterial hypertension and chronic lymphatic leukaemia with no specific treatment, who suffered meningoencephalitis and brain abscesses caused by L. monocytogenes. Symptoms were a 48-hour history of headache and a febrile condition. The CSF showed lymphocytic pleocytosis with hypoglycorrhachia. Magnetic resonance scans of the brain revealed areas of cerebritis and multiple brain abscesses in the right frontal lobe. Specific treatment was established with ampicillin for 13 weeks, associated with gentamicin and vancomycin during the first few weeks, until x-rays showed the lesions to be resolved. L. monocytogenes infections must be investigated in all patients with cellular immunosuppression who present febrile symptoms. The central nervous system may be the only area of the body infected. Moreover, this site will need studying in patients who present neurological focus data or an alteration in the state of consciousness and bacteraemia due to L. monocytogenes. Establishing suitable treatment as early as possible can improve the prognosis.

We report a case of Listeria rhombencephalitis in a previously healthy 60-year-old man. Listeria rhombencephalitis is a rare but well-defined clinical syndrome of lower brain-stem involvement caused by Listeria monocytogenes. Contrary to other listerioses, rhombencephalitis has been mainly observed in patients without predisposing conditions. In our case, however, findings of a detailed immunologic study, performed three months and one year, respectively, after clinical onset of Listeria rhombencephalitis manifestations, showed a transient cellular immunity defect, not associated with any other apparent disease.

A previously healthy 35-year-old Caucasian woman developed left body (including facial) hemianaesthesia, asymmetrical lower cranial nerve palsies and cerebellar signs after a 4-day history of headache, nausea and vomiting. Serial blood and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) cultures returned negative for a culprit organism. CSF examination revealed a lymphocytic pleocytosis and an elevated protein count. CSF cytological examination identified plasma cells. MRI of brain showed multiple ring-enhancing 'abscess-like' lesions in the brainstem and upper cervical cord together with abnormal meningeal enhancement. A decision was made to treat her empirically for Listeria rhombencephalitis to which she responded completely. CSF PCR eventually returned positive for Listeria monocytogenes. This case illustrates the utility of clinical features, MRI, CSF cytology and PCR in diagnosis and treatment of culture negative L monocytogenes rhombencephalitis in an immunocompetent individual.
