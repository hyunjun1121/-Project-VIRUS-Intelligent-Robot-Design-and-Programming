[PMID: 25532001]
Chromogranin A (CgA) is the most important general tumour marker used in the diagnosis and follow-up of patients with neuroendocrine tumours (NET). Chromogranin A assays may have different sensitivities, which is of importance for the clinical diagnosis and handling of NET patients. The aim of this study was to compare the clinical sensitivities of three different CgA assays in NET patients. We measured CgA level in 42 NET patients (male/female: 23/19, median age: 63 years, range 29-85 years). Twenty-five patients had liver metastases, eight had local disease, and nine were disease free after surgery. We studied an in-house RIA: RH RIA assay (Rigshospitalet, Copenhagen, Denmark); NEOLISATM (Euro Diagnostica, Malmö, Sweden) and EURIA CgA RIA (Euro Diagnostica, Malmö, Sweden). The RH RIA assay showed a clinical sensitivity of 97%, while the NEOLISA and EURIA assays both showed similar clinical sensitivities of 79%. Patients with liver metastases had significantly higher CgA levels compared to disease free patients by all three assays (P<0.001), but only the RH RIA assay was able to discriminate between patients with liver metastases and with regional disease (P<0.01). Chromogranin A measurements are significantly assay-dependent and caution should be applied in the interpretation of CgA measurement for assessment of NET status. The in-house RH RIA assay was better at predicting NET status than the NEOLISA and EURIA assays.

Twenty-two paragangliomas from different anatomical sites and 24 thymic neuroendocrine carcinomas (carcinoid tumors) were analyzed for traditional and novel immunohistochemical markers. In the paraganglioma group, there were 8 men and 14 women between the ages of 23 and 79 years (mean, 46 years). Their symptoms depended on the location of the tumor and included neck swelling and Horner syndrome for neck tumors, whereas abdominal and chest pain was present in tumors of the abdomen and mediastinum, respectively. One patient had Carney triad. In the carcinoid group, the patients were 20 men and 4 women between the ages of 25 and 78 years (mean, 48 years). These patients were symptomatic with chest pain, shortness of breath, and dyspnea. One patient presented with multiple endocrine neoplasia syndrome. Complete surgical resection was accomplished in all patients. The 46 neuroendocrine tumors were evaluated for GATA-3, pancytokeratin, thryoid transcription factor 1 (TTF-1), napsin A, chromogranin A, and synaptophysin. All paragangliomas were universally positive for chromogranin A and synaptophysin, but negative for pancytokeratin, TTF-1, and napsin A. GATA-3 was expressed in 12 (55%) of 22 tumors. The thymic neuroendocrine carcinomas (carcinoid tumors) were universally positive for pancytokeratin, but negative for GATA-3 and napsin A. Chromogranin A and synaptophysin were expressed in 92% and 88% of cases, respectively, and TTF-1 in 4 (17%) of 24 cases. Based on these results, we recommend that the workup of neuroendocrine tumors should include not only the conventional neuroendocrine markers and pancytokeratin but also other markers such as GATA-3 and TTF-1 in order to arrive at a better interpretation.

Primary sinonasal intestinal-type adenocarcinomas (ITAC) are defined on the basis of their morphological similarities to colorectal adenocarcinomas (CRA). Thus, differential diagnosis with sinonasal metastasis of CRA could be a real challenge. Neuroendocrine differentiation has been variably described in several types of adenocarcinomas and notably in ITACs and CRAs. In a series of 25 ITACs and 25 lymph node metastasis of CRAs (nmCRA), we analysed neuroendocrine differentiation by immunohistochemistry with anti-chromogranin A and synaptophysin antibodies. Neuroendocrine differentiation (chromogranin A and/or synaptophysin positivity) was significantly different (p=0.0002) in ITACs (72%) and in nmCRAs (20%). In conclusion, presence of neuroendocrine cells seems more in favour of a sinonasal intestinal-type adenocarcinoma, than metastatic CRA. This immunohistochemical study could be useful in difficult cases and should be an interesting complement in a clinical discussion.

The insulin receptor (IR) regulates nutrient uptake and utilization in multiple organs, but its role in the intestinal epithelium is not defined. This study developed a mouse model with villin-Cre (VC) recombinase-mediated intestinal epithelial cell (IEC)-specific IR deletion (VC-IR(Δ/Δ)) and littermate controls with floxed, but intact, IR (IR(fl/fl)) to define in vivo roles of IEC-IR in mice fed chow or high-fat diet (HFD). We hypothesized that loss of IEC-IR would alter intestinal growth, biomarkers of intestinal epithelial stem cells (IESC) or other lineages, body weight, adiposity, and glucose or lipid handling. In lean, chow-fed mice, IEC-IR deletion did not affect body or fat mass, plasma glucose, or IEC proliferation. In chow-fed VC-IR(Δ/Δ) mice, mRNA levels of the Paneth cell marker lysozyme (Lyz) were decreased, but markers of other differentiated lineages were unchanged. During HFD-induced obesity, IR(fl/fl) and VC-IR(Δ/Δ) mice exhibited similar increases in body and fat mass, plasma insulin, mRNAs encoding several lipid-handling proteins, a decrease in Paneth cell number, and impaired glucose tolerance. In IR(fl/fl) mice, HFD-induced obesity increased circulating cholesterol; numbers of chromogranin A (CHGA)-positive enteroendocrine cells (EEC); and mRNAs encoding Chga, glucose-dependent insulinotrophic peptide (Gip), glucagon (Gcg), Lyz, IESC biomarkers, and the enterocyte cholesterol transporter Scarb1. All these effects were attenuated or lost in VC-IR(Δ/Δ) mice. These results demonstrate that IEC-IR is not required for normal growth of the intestinal epithelium in lean adult mice. However, our findings provide novel evidence that, during HFD-induced obesity, IEC-IR contributes to increases in EEC, plasma cholesterol, and increased expression of Scarb1 or IESC-, EEC-, and Paneth cell-derived mRNAs.

We investigated whether some mucinous carcinomas (MUCs) are associated with lobular neoplasia (LN) components, and if so, whether this subset has any distinct biological properties. MUC specimens from 41 patients were stratified into pure and mixed types. The LN components adjacent to MUC lesions were examined histopathologically. We also tested immunohistochemically for E-cadherin, β-catenin, and the neuroendocrine markers chromogranin A and synaptophysin; and compared results between MUCs with and without LN. Of 41 patients with MUC, LN was detected in 12 patients (29%); LN alone was the noninvasive component in 8 patients (20%). Decreased E-cadherin and β-catenin expression in the MUC component was detected in 2 (17%) and 7 (58%) cases, respectively, of MUC with LN, compared with 0% (P = 0.080) and 21% (P = 0.018) in MUCs without LN. Neuroendocrine factors were frequently detected in MUCs with LN (42%) and without LN (52%), but tended to be less frequent in MUCs with only LN components (25%) than in other MUCs (55%; P = 0.133). MUCs associated with LN components appear to be a biologically characteristic subset that frequently shows decreased cell-cell adhesion, cell polarity molecules and lack of neuroendocrine differentiation.

To access the correlation of Chromogranin A (CgA) with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) activity and responsiveness to medical therapy. A prospective observational study was conducted in 56 patients with moderate ulcerative colitis (UC) or Crohn's disease (CD) (UC, n = 29, CD, n = 27), 17 patients with irritable bowel syndrome and predominant diarrhea (IBS-D) and 40 healthy volunteers. IBD patients were treated by biologics (infliximab or adalimumab) or conventional agents (aminosalicylates, thiopurines or methotrexate and steroids) and were classified according to their treatment in two groups. Serum CgA was measured at baseline and 4-week posttreatment period. Serum CgA was significantly higher in IBD patients than in those with IBS-D or healthy volunteers (p < 0.01). Furthermore, serum CgA was markedly increased in CD patients than in UC patients (p < 0.01). CgA value was significantly reduced in 'biologic' group (24 IBD patients, UC, n = 15, CD, n = 9) at 4-week posttreatment period (p < 0.01), while 18/24 (72%) patients were already in remission during that time. In contrast, CgA value was significantly increased in the 'conventional' treatment group (32 IBD patients, UC, n = 14, CD, n = 18) between the two visits (p < 0.01), although 22/32 (69%) patients were in remission during the 4-week posttreatment period. CgA appears to be a reliable marker of disease activity in IBD patients and especially in those who received biologic therapy. IBS-D patients presented normal CgA values.

Together with Chromogranin B and Secretogranins, Chromogranin A (CGA) is stored in secretory (chromaffin) granules of the diffuse neuroendocrine system and released with noradrenalin and adrenalin. Co-stored within the granule together with neuropeptideY, cardiac natriuretic peptide hormones, several prohormones and their proteolytic enzymes, CGA is a multifunctional protein and a major marker of the sympatho-adrenal neuroendocrine activity. Due to its partial processing to several biologically active peptides, CGA appears an important pro-hormone implicated in relevant modulatory actions on endocrine, cardiovascular, metabolic, and immune systems through both direct and indirect sympatho-adrenergic interactions. As a part of this scenario, we here illustrate the emerging role exerted by the full-length CGA and its three derived fragments, i.e., Vasostatin 1, catestatin and serpinin, in the control of circulatory homeostasis with particular emphasis on their cardio-vascular actions under both physiological and physio-pathological conditions. The Vasostatin 1- and catestatin-induced cardiodepressive influences are achieved through anti-beta-adrenergic-NO-cGMP signaling, while serpinin acts like beta1-adrenergic agonist through AD-cAMP-independent NO signaling. On the whole, these actions contribute to widen our knowledge regarding the sympatho-chromaffin control of the cardiovascular system and its highly integrated "whip-brake" networks.

Pancreatic neuroendocrine tumors (PNETs) are a group of rare tumors. Chromogranin A (CgA) was considered as the most practical and useful serum tumor marker in PNET patients. But peripheral blood levels of CgA are not routinely tested in Chinese patients with PNETs. This study was to assess the diagnostic value of CgA in Chinese patients with PNETs especially in patients with insulinomas. Eighty-nine patients with PNETs including 57 insulinomas and 32 non-insulinoma PNETs as well as 86 healthy participants were enrolled in this study between September 2003 and June 2013. Serum levels of CgA were measured by ELISA method. Expression of CgA protein was detected in 26 PNET tissues including 14 insulinomas by immunohistochemical staining. Serum levels of CgA in 89 PNET patients were significantly higher than that in healthy controls (P = 7.2 × 10-9). Serum levels of CgA in 57 patients with insulinomas (median 64.8 ng/ml, range 25-164) were slightly higher than the levels in healthy controls (median 53.4 ng/ml, range 39-94) but much lower than the levels in 32 patients with non-insulinoma PNETs (median 193 ng/ml, range 27-9021), P = 0.001. The serum CgA levels were reduced in 16 of 17 patients with insulinomas after tumor resection. ROC curve showed that CgA values at 60 ng/ml distinguished patients with insulinomas from healthy controls but its sensitivity and specificity were 66.7% and 73.3%, respectively. In contrast, CgA values at 74 ng/ml distinguished patients with non-insulinoma PNETs from healthy controls, and the sensitivity and specificity were 65.6% and 91.9%, respectively. Except for two insulinomas with negative staining of CgA, 12 insulinoma tissues showed positive staining of CgA. CgA is a reliable serum diagnostic biomarker for PNETs but not for insulinomas.

Although chromogranin A (CGA) is a useful marker for pancreatic neuroendocrine tumors (pNET) in the West, its usefulness in Japanese populations is unclear. To assess this, we evaluated the serum CGA levels in 189 patients with various pancreatic diseases, including proven pNET (n = 69), pancreatic cancer (PC) (n = 50), chronic pancreatitis (CP) (n = 50) and autoimmune pancreatitis (AIP) (n = 20), and 112 normal controls (controls) using an ELISA kit. The mean CGA level of patients with pNET was significantly higher than any of the other groups (407.8 ± 984.6 ng/mL [pNET] vs 91.8 ± 101.8 ng/mL [PC], 93.6 ± 57.5 ng/mL [CP], 69.9 ± 52.4 ng/mL [AIP] and 62.5 ± 48.3 ng/mL [controls]). Limiting the analysis to patients not using proton pump inhibitors (PPI), the CGA level of patients with PC or CP was not significantly different compared with the controls. Discriminant analysis revealed that the best cut-off value of CGA to distinguish patients with pNET from the controls was 78.7 ng/mL, with a sensitivity and specificity of 53.6% and 78.6%, respectively. In patients with pNET, significant factors associating with elevated CGA levels were tumor classification, tumor size, and the presence of liver metastases in univariate analysis as well as PPI use and the presence of liver metastases in multivariate analysis. We show that CGA is a useful marker for diagnosing pNET in Japanese populations and for distinguishing patients with pNET from patients with other pancreatic diseases. The increased use of CGA in Japan will likely be a helpful tool in managing these patients, as found in the West.

Chromogranin A (CgA) not only plays an important role in pathologic diagnosis, but is also used as a circulating biomarker in patients with gastroenteropancreatic neuroendocrine neoplasm (GEP-NEN). However, the relationship between immunohistochemistry (IHC) expression and serum levels of CgA has not been investigated. The value of CgA for evaluating treatment response and prognosis is still not well understood. We conducted this study to assess the significance of CgA in GEP-NEN in terms of diagnosis, curative effects evaluation and prognosis. One hundred forty-five patients comprising 88 patients with active disease and 57 disease-free patients were enrolled in this study from January 2011 to November 2013. The expression of CgA was assessed by IHC, and serial serum CgA levels were measured by enzyme linked immunosorbent assay. The overall expression rate of CgA was 69.0% (100/145). CgA expression was associated with tumor site and stage (P < 0.05), but not correlated with prognosis (P = 0.07). Serum CgA levels were significantly higher in GEP-NEN patients with active disease when compared with disease-free patients (P = 0.001) or healthy participants (P < 0.001). A CgA cutoff value of 95 ng/ml discriminated between healthy subjects or disease-free patients and patients with active disease (sensitivity 51.2% and specificity 87.5%, respectively). There was a correlation between the CgA IHC expression and high serum CgA levels (R = 0.320, P = 0.002). Serum CgA levels were much higher in patients who classified as neuroendocrine carcinoma, mixed adenoendocrine carcinoma (P = 0.035) and who were on stage IV (P = 0.041). Changes in CgA levels normalization or ≥ 30% decrease suggested that patients had tumor response. Furthermore, patients with serum CgA levels higher than 95 ng/ml had a significantly shorter survival compared with patients with levels lower than 95 ng/ml (P < 0.001). CgA is a reliable pathologic and circulating maker for diagnosis of GEP-NEN. We further confirmed that serial measurement of CgA may be useful for evaluating the efficacy of different kinds of therapies in patients during follow-up, and serum CgA level ≥ 95 ng/ml may serve as a predictor of overall survial.
