Where is the yeast transpozable element Ty3 preferentially inserted?

[PMID: 22544262]
Long terminal repeat (LTR) retrotransposons make up substantial parts of most higher plant genomes where they accumulate due to their replicative mode of transposition. Although the transposition is facilitated by proteins encoded within the gag-pol region which is common to all autonomous elements, some LTR retrotransposons were found to potentially carry an additional protein coding capacity represented by extra open reading frames located upstream or downstream of gag-pol. In this study, we performed a comprehensive in silico survey and comparative analysis of these extra open reading frames (ORFs) in the group of Ty3/gypsy LTR retrotransposons as the first step towards our understanding of their origin and function. We found that extra ORFs occur in all three major lineages of plant Ty3/gypsy elements, being the most frequent in the Tat lineage where most (77Â %) of identified elements contained extra ORFs. This lineage was also characterized by the highest diversity of extra ORF arrangement (position and orientation) within the elements. On the other hand, all of these ORFs could be classified into only two broad groups based on their mutual similarities or the presence of short conserved motifs in their inferred protein sequences. In the Athila lineage, the extra ORFs were confined to the element 3' regions but they displayed much higher sequence diversity compared to those found in Tat. In the lineage of Chromoviruses the extra ORFs were relatively rare, occurring only in 5' regions of a group of elements present in a single plant family (Poaceae). In all three lineages, most extra ORFs lacked sequence similarities to characterized gene sequences or functional protein domains, except for two Athila-like elements with similarities to LOGL4 gene and part of the Chromoviruses extra ORFs that displayed partial similarity to histone H3 gene. Thus, in these cases the extra ORFs most likely originated by transduction or recombination of cellular gene sequences. In addition, the protein domain which is otherwise associated with DNA transposons have been detected in part of the Tat-like extra ORFs, pointing to their origin from an insertion event of a mobile element.

Insertions of the yeast element Ty3 resulting from induced retrotransposition were characterized in order to identify the genomic targets of transposition. The DNA sequences of the junctions between Ty3 and flanking DNA were determined for two insertions of an unmarked element. Each insertion was at position -17 from the 5' end of a tRNA-coding sequence. Ninety-one independent insertions of a marked Ty3 element were studied by Southern blot analysis. Pairs of independent insertions into seven genomic loci accounted for 14 of these insertions. The DNA sequence flanking the insertion site was determined for at least one member of each pair of integrated elements. In each case, insertion was at position -16 or -17 relative to the 5' end of one of seven different tRNA genes. This proportion of genomic loci used twice for Ty3 integration is consistent with that predicted by a Poisson distribution for a number of genomic targets roughly equivalent to the estimated number of yeast tRNA genes. In addition, insertions upstream of the same tRNA gene in one case were at different positions, but in all cases were in the same orientation. Thus, genomic insertions of Ty3 in a particular orientation are apparently specified by the target, while the actual position of the insertion relative to the tRNA-coding sequence can vary slightly.

Over 190 independent insertions into target plasmids of the retrovirus-like element Ty3 were recovered and mapped. Ty3 was shown to insert upstream of tRNA, 5S, and U6 genes, all of which are transcribed by RNA polymerase III. Integration sites were within 1-4 nucleotides of the position of transcription initiation, even for one mutant gene where the polymerase III initiation site was shifted to a completely new context. Mutagenesis of a SUP2 tRNA gene target showed that integration required functional promoter elements but that it did not correlate in a simple way with target transcription. This is the first report directly linking a discrete genomic function with preferential insertion of a retrotransposon.

The retrovirus-like element Ty3 of Saccharomyces cerevisiae integrates at the transcription initiation region of RNA polymerase III. To identify host genes that affect transposition, a collection of insertion mutants was screened using a genetic assay in which insertion of Ty3 activates expression of a tRNA suppressor. Fifty-three loci were identified in this screen. Corresponding knockout mutants were tested for the ability to mobilize a galactose-inducible Ty3, marked with the HIS3 gene. Of 42 mutants tested, 22 had phenotypes similar to those displayed in the original assay. The proteins encoded by the defective genes are involved in chromatin dynamics, transcription, RNA processing, protein modification, cell cycle regulation, nuclear import, and unknown functions. These mutants were induced for Ty3 expression and assayed for Gag3p protein, integrase, cDNA, and Ty3 integration upstream of chromosomal tDNA(Val(AAC)) genes. Most mutants displayed differences from the wild type in one or more intermediates, although these were typically not as severe as the genetic defect. Because a relatively large number of genes affecting retrotransposition can be identified in yeast and because the majority of these genes have mammalian homologs, this approach provides an avenue for the identification of potential antiviral targets.

Retroviruses in nondividing cells and yeast retrotransposons must transit the nuclear membrane in order for integration to occur. Mutations in a bipartite basic motif in the carboxyl-terminal domain of the Ty3 integrase (IN) protein were previously shown to block transposition at a step subsequent to 3'-end processing of Ty3 extrachromosomal DNA. In this work, the Ty3 IN was shown to be sufficient to target green fluorescent protein to the nucleolus. Mutations in the bipartite basic motif abrogated this localization. The region containing the motif was shown to be sufficient for nuclear but not subnuclear localization of a heterologous protein. Viruslike particles (VLPs) from cells expressing a Ty3 element defective for nuclear localization were inactive in an in vitro integration assay, suggesting that nuclear entry is required to form active VLPs or that this motif is required for post-nuclear entry steps. Ty3 inserts at transcription initiation sites of genomic tRNA genes and plasmid-borne 5S and U6 RNA genes transcribed by RNA polymerase III. In situ hybridization with Ty3- and Ty3 long terminal repeat-specific probes showed that these elements which are associated with tRNA genes do not colocalize with the ribosomal DNA (rDNA). However, a PCR assay of cells undergoing transposition showed that Ty3 insertion does occur into the 5S genes, which, in yeast, are interspersed with the rDNA and therefore, like Ty3 IN, associated with the nucleolus.

The function of a TATA element in RNA polymerase (EC 2.7.7.6) III transcription of a naturally TATA-containing U6 snRNA gene and a naturally TATA-less tRNA gene was probed by transcription and Ty3 transposition analyses. Deletion of the TATA box from a U6 minigene did not abolish transcription and Ty3 integration but changed the positions of initiation and insertion. Insertion of the U6 TATA box at three positions upstream of the TATA-less SUP2 tRNA(Tyr) gene resulted in novel transcription initiation and Ty3 integration patterns that depended upon position of the insertion. Nevertheless, the predominant tRNA gene initiation sites were not affected by insertion of the TATA sequence and remained at a fixed distance from the internal box A promoter element. Insertions of the TATA box upstream of a SUP2 box A mutant affected the level of transcription and restricted the use of upstream start sites, but they neither enhanced the use of TATA-dependent initiation sites nor restored expression to the level of the wild-type gene. We conclude that (i) the U6 TATA box is essential in vivo for correct initiation but not for transcription, (ii) a TATA box does not compensate for a weak box A sequence and so cannot perform equivalently, and (iii) the TATA-binding protein, and probably components of transcription factor IIIB, are present on the target at the time of Ty3 integration.
