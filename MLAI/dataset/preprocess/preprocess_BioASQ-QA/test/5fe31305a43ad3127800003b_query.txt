What is the target of adalimumab?

[PMID: 16164218]
Biological agents targeting on pro-inflammatory cytokines are developed, and provide a great impact on the medical management of rheumatoid arthritis (RA). Particularly, biologics against tumor necrosis factor(TNF) can not only induce great clinical improvement, but also halt structural damage on the joints. Now chimeric anti-TNFalpha monoclonal antibody, infliximab, full human anti-TNFalpha monoclonal antibody, adalimumab, and TNF receptor II (p75) -IgGFc fusion protein, etanercept, are widely used in the inflammatory disorders including RA. This review article shows the characteristics of these anti-TNF biologics on RA, and summarizes the efficacy as well as the safety of the agents.

Adalimumab is a fully human monoclonal antibody targeted toward tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-alpha). TNF-alpha is proinflammatory cytokine involved in the pathogenesis of many inflammatory diseases, as the psoriasis. The production process of adalimumab is complex and it is based in the called phague display technology.

Adalimumab is a human monoclonal antibody which targets tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha. It is produced by recombinant DNA technology, using a mammalian cell expression system and is widely-known to treat a number of immune-mediated conditions, including psoriasis. There has been a growing concern regarding the possible association between TNF-alpha inhibitors and malignancy. In this case report, we describe the case of a 20-year-old woman, known to have been suffering from chronic plaque psoriasis for 12 years, and who developed Hodgkin's lymphoma within five weeks of beginning adalimumab treatment.

As our understanding of the pathogenesis of autoimmune diseases is growing, new therapies are being developed to target disease-specific pathways. Since the introduction of etanercept in 1998, several biotechnological agents have been developed, most of them indicated in the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis, but also psoriatic arthritis. Most currently available molecules target TNF-alfa with different strategies (i.e., etanercept, infliximab, adalimumab, golimumab, and certolizumab pegol), IL-6 (tocilizumab), CTLA-4 (abatacept), and B cells (rituximab, belimumab) as they are key mediators in the cascade of inflammation. Further, small molecules have been recently developed to target intracellular signaling, such as Janus Kinases for tofacitinib, the first FDA-approved small molecule for rheumatoid arthritis. Most novel treatments are being developed for arthritis with specific differences between rheumatoid and psoriatic arthritis, as well as for systemic lupus erythematosus, following the approval of belimumab. Finally, biologic therapies are effective also in gout, mainly targeting interleukin-1 to block the inflammasome. This review article describes the new and upcoming treatment options for rheumatoid arthritis, psoriatic arthritis, systemic lupus erythematosus, and gout to dissect what we should be aware of when discussing these new and promising molecules.

Psoriasis is a chronic inflammatory disease affecting 2% to 3% of the population in Western countries. Psoriasis is associated with limited quality of life, cardiovascular disease, and depression. The approval of injectable biological agents has revolutionized the management of moderate to severe psoriasis. Adalimumab is a human monoclonal antibody against tumor necrosis factor (TNF) alpha approved for moderate-to-severe plaque-type psoriasis and psoriatic arthritis (PsA). This systematic review summarizes the evidence concerning the efficacy, clinical effectiveness, safety, and cost-effectiveness of adalimumab in the treatment of psoriasis. Five randomized controlled trials demonstrated the efficacy of adalimumab in moderate-to-severe plaque-type psoriasis and PsA with PASI-75 response rates of 53% to 80% and ACR-20 response rates of 39% to 58% after 12 to 16 weeks of treatment. In clinical practice patients who have not responded to one TNF antagonist may respond to another TNF antagonist. Adalimumab has similar or better cost-effectiveness than other biologics, but is less efficient than methotrexate and cyclosporine. Adalimumab is generally well tolerated. Patients should be evaluated for active/latent tuberculosis, serious infections, and other contraindications prior to initiation of adalimumab therapy. Future studies should investigate the comparative efficacy of adalimumab and other biologic and prebiologic agents. Recently established registries will yield additional data on the effectiveness and long-term safety of adalimumab.

The anti-tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNFα) therapeutic monoclonal antibodies (mAbs), such as adalimumab, are widely used in the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis, inflammatory bowel diseases, and other auto-immune diseases. The administration of adalimumab can elicit the immune responses from some patients, resulting in the formation of anti-drug antibodies (ADAbs). The ADAbs can diminish the therapeutic effects of adalimumab by neutralizing the TNFα binding site or increasing its clearance from circulation. To effectively monitor the therapeutic concentrations of adalimumab, we developed and validated a targeted quantitative proteomic assay to determine the circulating concentrations of adalimumab. Since drug effects can be attenuated by ADAbs, the method adopted an affinity-enrichment step to selectively quantify the bioavailable forms of adalimumab in patient serum samples. The performance of the LC-MS/MS based assay provides the analytical measuring range and precisions applicable for the therapeutic monitoring of adalimumab. It also provides comparable results to a cell-based activity assay when evaluating patient samples with different concentrations of adalimumab. Our assay can quantify both sub-therapeutic and therapeutic concentrations of bioavailable adalimumab in patient serum samples. This assay design provides an alternative to isotope-labeled peptides approach currently adopted in targeted proteomics methods.

Psoriasis is a chronic, systemic T-cell mediated autoimmune skin disease, potentially associated with arthritis. The new understanding of immunopathogenesis and inflammatory cytokine pathways was actually the rationale for developing and introducing biological drugs in the treatment of moderate to severe psoriasis and psoriatic arthritis. Different from the traditional systemic drugs that impact the entire immune system, bio-logics target only specific points of the immune system. This review focuses on five biologics which target either T-cells (alefacept) or TNF-alpha (etanercept, adalimumab and infliximab) or interleukin IL-12/IL-23 (ustekinumab)--their efficacy, safety, patient monitoring and recommended dosage. The purpose of the treatment guidelines presented here is to provide a high standard of continuing care of psoriasis and psoriatic arthritis patients.

Tumour necrosis factor (TNF) plays an important role in the pathogenesis of immune-mediated inflammatory diseases (IMIDs). TNF inhibition results in down-regulation of abnormal and progressive inflammatory processes, resulting in rapid and sustained clinical remission, improved quality of life and prevention of target organ damage. Adalimumab is the first fully human monoclonal antibody directed against TNF. In this article, we review the role and cost effectiveness of adalimumab in the treatment of IMIDs in adults and children. The efficacy and tolerability of adalimumab has been demonstrated in patients with a wide range of inflammatory conditions, leading to regulatory approval in rheumatoid arthritis (RA), psoriatic arthritis (PsA), plaque psoriasis, inflammatory bowel diseases (Crohn's disease, ulcerative colitis, paediatric Crohn's disease, and intestinal Behçet's disease), ankylosing spondylitis (AS), axial spondyloarthritis (SpA) and juvenile idiopathic arthritis. The major tolerability issues with adalimumab are class effects, such as injection site reactions and increased risk of infection and lymphoma. As with all anti-TNF agents, adalimumab is immunogenic, although less than infliximab, and some patients receiving long-term adalimumab will develop anti-drug antibodies, causing a loss of response. Comparisons of its clinical utility and cost effectiveness have shown it to be a valid treatment choice in a wide range of patients. Recent data from Italian economic studies show the cost effectiveness of adalimumab to be below the threshold value for health care interventions for most indications. In addition, analysis of indirect costs shows that adalimumab significantly reduces social costs associated with RA, PsA, AS, Crohn's disease and psoriasis. The fact that adalimumab has the widest range of approved indications, many often presenting together in the same patient due to the common pathogenesis, may further improve the utility of adalimumab. Current clinical evidence shows adalimumab to be a valuable resource in the management of IMIDs. Further research, designed to identify patients who may benefit most from this drug, will better highlight the role and cost-effectiveness of this versatile TNF inhibitor.

In psoriasis, a specific cytokine network has been described to play a central role in the pathophysiology of the disease. Anti-cytokine therapeutic approaches have been largely developed and TNFα constitutes the main target. Adalimumab is a human anti-TNFα monoclonal antibody that has been reported to demonstrate clinical efficacy and safety, resulting in reversal of epidermal hyperplasia and cutaneous inflammation. We aimed to analyse changes in the skin inflammatory transcriptomic profile in psoriatic patients during adalimumab therapy. In addition, the circulating cytokine profile was analysed to define systemic inflammation. Eighteen patients with chronic plaque psoriasis were treated with adalimumab. After four and 16 weeks, clinical efficacy was assessed using PASI and DLQI, and skin mRNA profiles were determined and circulating cytokines quantified. We identified a rapid effect of adalimumab therapy on a large array of Th17 cytokines of the skin, which may account for the modification of keratinocyte expression profile and clinical response. In contrast, analysis of serum cytokine concentrations was uninformative, confirming the need for characterization of local cytokines in skin lesions. Finally, in non-responders, local cytokine expression was shown to be unchanged. We show that TNFα inhibition in psoriasis patients treated with adalimumab has a broad effect on the expression profile of cytokines and keratinocyte markers of skin inflammation, which may account for its clinical efficacy.

The monoclonal antibodies can selectively target specific molecules, proteins or receptors in the body responsible for pathogenesis of a particular disorder. Some cytokines play key role in the development of proliferative diabetic retinopathy, neovascular age related macular degeneration, glaucoma and many other inflammatory conditions of eye. Monoclonal antibodies against VEGF and TNF-alpha such as bevacizumab, ranibizumab, infliximab and adalimumab have been used to control neovascularization and inflammation in eye with significant positive results whereas others have been used to target CD20, CD52, CD11a, and IL-2. The growing interest in these drugs with current progress in biotechnology and genetic engineering has kindled active research and with more understanding of the molecular basis of many ocular disorders these antibodies are being explored in a variety of different pathological conditions of the eye. Various sight threatening serious eye disorders which are resistant to the conventional available therapy have responded favorably to these drugs. Despite the limitations of high cost and uncertainty around long term safety profile, rational use of the monoclonal antibodies holds immense promise in management of various ocular conditions.

Psoriasis is a chronic inflammatory disease of the skin. The causes of psoriasis are unknown, although family and twin studies have shown genetic factors to play a key role in its development. The many genes associated with psoriasis and the immune response include TNF α , IL23, and IL12. Advances in knowledge of the pathogenesis of psoriasis have enabled the development of new drugs that target cytokines (e.g., etanercept, adalimumab, and infliximab, which target TNF α , and ustekinumab, which targets the p40 subunit of IL23 and IL12). These drugs have improved the safety and efficacy of treatment in comparison with previous therapies. However, not all patients respond equally to treatment, possibly owing to interindividual genetic variability. In this review, we describe the genes associated with psoriasis and the immune response, the biological drugs used to treat chronic severe plaque psoriasis, new drugs in phase II and III trials, and current knowledge on the implications of pharmacogenomics in predicting response to these treatments.

The next generation of targeted biologic therapies for psoriasis will either be directed against new protein targets or improve on the efficacy, safety, or convenience of medications available for an already validated area in the immune response. Adalimumab is a fully human monoclonal antibody directed against tumor necrosis factor-alpha, a central cytokine in the immune response in psoriasis that has already been shown to be an effective target for therapy. This medication is approved by the US Food and Drug Administration (USFDA) for the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis. Early phrase II studies with adalimumab have shown excellent efficacy for psoriasis with either weekly or every other week subcutaneous injection. Moreover, the safety and tolerability of adalimumab in large clinical studies of rheumatoid arthritis have shown good results. Thus, adalimumab shows significant promise for the therapy of psoriasis in the future.

Tumour necrosis factor (TNF) has a central role in the pathogenesis of psoriatic arthritis (PsA). Adalimumab (Humira, Abbott Laboratories) is the first fully human, recombinant IgG1 monoclonal antibody that specifically targets human TNF. Adalimumab blocks the interaction of TNF with the p55 and p75 cell surface TNF receptors, thereby neutralising the activity of this cytokine. In clinical trials of patients with PsA, adalimumab significantly reduced both joint and skin symptoms. In addition, structural changes were inhibited, and statistically and clinically significant improvements in measures of disability and quality of life were observed. Adalimumab was generally safe and well tolerated.

The pharmacokinetic models that are applied to describe the disposition of therapeutic antibodies assume that the interaction between an antibody and its target takes place in the central compartment. However, an increasing number of therapeutic antibodies are directed towards soluble/mobile targets. A flawed conclusion can be reached if the pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic analysis assumes that the interaction between the therapeutic antibody and its target takes place in the central compartment. The objective of this study was to assess the relative importance of local versus systemic interactions between adalimumab and tumour necrosis factor (TNF)-α in rheumatoid arthritis (RA), identify localization of the site of adalimumab action and assess the efficacy of local (intra-articular) versus systemic adalimumab administration for treatment of RA. The clinical and preclinical data on adalimumab and TNFα disposition were analysed using a pharmacokinetic modelling and simulation approach. The disposition of adalimumab and TNFα and the interaction between them at the individual compartments (the synovial fluid of the affected joints, central and peripheral compartments) following different routes of adalimumab administration were studied. Outcomes of modelling and simulation using the pharmacokinetic model developed indicate that adalimumab can efficiently permeate from the diseased joints to the central circulation in RA patients. Permeability of TNFα, which is excessively secreted in the joints, is even higher than that of adalimumab. As a result, subcutaneous, intravenous and intra-articular administration of the clinically used dose of adalimumab (40 mg) exert similar effects on the time course of TNFα concentrations at different locations in the body and efficiently deplete the TNFα in all of the compartments for a prolonged period of time (8-10 weeks). At this dose, adalimumab exhibits predominantly systemic anti-TNFα effects at the central and peripheral compartments (∼93% of the overall effect) and the contribution of the local effects in the rheumatic joints is ∼7% for all of the studied routes, including the local intra-articular injections. The major pathway of TNFα elimination from the synovial fluid (∼77% for subcutaneous administration, and ∼72% for intravenous and intra-articular administration of adalimumab 40 mg) is interaction with adalimumab, which reaches the joints following local or systemic administration. The kinetics of adalimumab permeation to the synovial fluid (0.00422 L/h clearance of permeation) versus the rate of TNFα turnover in the affected joints (1.84 pmol/h synthesis rate and 0.877 h(-1) degradation rate constant) are apparently the major parameters that determine the time course of TNFα concentrations in the synovial fluid and the TNFα-neutralizing effects of adalimumab in RA patients. Outcomes of this study suggest that intra-articular administration of adalimumab is not preferable to subcutaneous or intravenous treatment. Local and systemic permeability, turnover and interactions between the drug and the target should be taken into account for optimization of the use of drugs acting on soluble targets (growth factors, interferons, interleukins, immunoglobulins, etc.).

There are currently two Food and Drug Administration-approved classes of biologic agents that target tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha): anti-TNF monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) (adalimumab and infliximab), and soluble TNF receptors (etanercept). This study examined the ability of the TNF antagonists to: (1) bind various polymorphic variants of cell surface-expressed Fc receptors (FcgammaRs) and the complement component C1q, and (2) mediate Ab-dependent cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC) and complement-mediated cytotoxicity (CDC) killing of cells expressing membrane-bound TNF (mTNF) in vitro. Both mAbs and the soluble TNF receptor demonstrated low-level binding to the activating receptors FcgammaRI, FcgammaRIIa, and FcgammaRIIIa, and the inhibitory receptor FcgammaRIIb, in the absence of exogenous TNF. However, upon addition of TNF, the mAbs, but not etanercept, showed significantly increased binding, in particular to the FcgammaRII and FcgammaRIII receptors. Infliximab and adalimumab induced ADCC much more potently than etanercept. In the presence of TNF, both mAbs bound C1q in in vitro assays, but etanercept did not bind C1q under any conditions. Infliximab and adalimumab also induced CDC in cells expressing mTNF more potently than etanercept. Differences in the ability to bind ligand and mediate cell death may account for the differences in efficacy and safety of TNF antagonists.

Targeted drugs against key pathogenetic molecules such as TNF-alpha have significantly improved outcomes in rheumatoid arthritis (RA). They are widely used in clinical practice and drug registries give us information to support their use. Adalimumab (ADA) is able to induce a comprehensive disease control in RA by achieving clinical, functional and radiographic control. By interrogating 2 Italian registries, LORHEN and GISEA, we analysed the efficacy of ADA in first- or second-line in a total of 2262 RA patients. Patients in 1st line were significantly older, with lower disease activity and HAQ scores compared to 2nd line. In 1st line, rates of DAS28-remission (DAS28rem) at 2 years were 34.4% while 26.5% in 2nd line (p=0.038). A normal HAQ score (HAQ≤0.5) was achieved in 53.5% after 2 years in 1st line versus 30.1% in 2nd (p<0.0001). DAS28rem+HAQ≤0.5, a combined parameter that we defined global clinical disease control, was reached in 20.7% in 1st line versus 13.3% in 2nd (p<0.01). Five-year-survival on therapy was higher for patients in 1st line (45.6% vs. 33.2%, p<0.0001). Discontinuation due to lack of efficacy was lower in 1st line (37.4 vs. 54.4%, p<0.0001). Rates of adverse events were similar. Responses in 1st line are generally significantly better than after a first anti-TNF-alpha failure but patients in 2nd line have a worse clinical and functional profile. A global disease control with clinical and functional remission is an achievable target in both lines.
