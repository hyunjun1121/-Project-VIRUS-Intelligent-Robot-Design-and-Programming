Protein-protein interactions play a pivotal role in coordinating many cellular processes. Determination of subcellular localization of interacting proteins and visualization of dynamic interactions in living cells are crucial to elucidate cellular functions of proteins. Using fluorescent proteins, we previously developed a bimolecular fluorescence complementation (BiFC) assay and a multicolor BiFC assay to visualize protein-protein interactions in living cells. However, the sensitivity of chromophore maturation of enhanced yellow fluorescent protein (YFP) to higher temperatures requires preincubation at lower temperatures prior to visualizing the BiFC signal. This could potentially limit their applications for the study of many signaling molecules. Here we report the identification of new fluorescent protein fragments derived from Venus and Cerulean for BiFC and multicolor BiFC assays under physiological culture conditions. More importantly, the newly identified combinations exhibit a 13-fold higher BiFC efficiency than originally identified fragments derived from YFP. Furthermore, the use of new combinations reduces the amount of plasmid required for transfection and shortens the incubation time, leading to a 2-fold increase in specific BiFC signals. These newly identified fluorescent protein fragments will facilitate the study of protein-protein interactions in living cells and whole animals under physiological conditions.

A variety of experimental methods have been developed for the analysis of protein interactions. The majority of these methods either require disruption of the cells to detect molecular interactions or rely on indirect detection of the protein interaction. The bimolecular fluorescence complementation (BiFC) assay provides a direct approach for the visualization of molecular interactions in living cells and organisms. The BiFC approach is based on the facilitated association between two fragments of a fluorescent protein when the fragments are brought together by an interaction between proteins fused to the fragments. The BiFC approach has been used for visualization of interactions among a variety of structurally diverse interaction partners in many different cell types. It enables detection of transient complexes as well as complexes formed by a subpopulation of the interaction partners. It is essential to include negative controls in each experiment in which the interface between the interaction partners has been mutated or deleted. The BiFC assay has been adapted for simultaneous visualization of multiple protein complexes in the same cell and the competition for shared interaction partners. A ubiquitin-mediated fluorescence complementation assay has also been developed for visualization of the covalent modification of proteins by ubiquitin family peptides. These fluorescence complementation assays have a great potential to illuminate a variety of biological interactions in the future.

Investigations of the molecular processes that sustain life must include studies of these processes in their normal cellular environment. The bimolecular fluorescence complementation (BiFC) assay provides an approach for the visualization of protein interactions and modifications in living cells. This assay is based on the facilitated association of complementary fragments of a fluorescent protein that are fused to interaction partners. Complex formation by the interaction partners tethers the fluorescent protein fragments in proximity to each other, which can facilitate their association. The BiFC assay enables sensitive visualization of protein complexes with high spatial resolution. The temporal resolution of BiFC analysis is limited by the time required for fluorophore formation, as well as the stabilization of complexes by association of the fluorescent protein fragments. Many modifications and enhancements to the BiFC assay have been developed. The multicolor BiFC assay enables simultaneous visualization of multiple protein complexes in the same cell, and can be used to investigate competition among mutually exclusive interaction partners for complex formation in cells. The ubiquitin-mediated fluorescence complementation (UbFC) assay enables visualization of covalent ubiquitin family peptide conjugation to substrate proteins in cells. The BiFC assay can also be used to visualize protein binding to specific chromatin domains, as well as other molecular scaffolds in cells. BiFC analysis therefore provides a powerful approach for the visualization of a variety of processes that affect molecular proximity in living cells. The visualization of macromolecular interactions and modifications is of great importance owing to the central roles of proteins, nucleic acids and other macromolecular complexes in the regulation of cellular functions. This tutorial review describes the BiFC assay, and discusses the advantages and disadvantages of this experimental approach. The review will be of interest to scientists interested in the investigation of macromolecular interactions or modifications who need exquisite sensitivity for the detection of their complexes or conjugates of interest.

Protein interactions are a fundamental mechanism for the generation of biological regulatory specificity. The study of protein interactions in living cells is of particular significance because the interactions that occur in a particular cell depend on the full complement of proteins present in the cell and the external stimuli that influence the cell. Bimolecular fluorescence complementation (BiFC) analysis enables direct visualization of protein interactions in living cells. The BiFC assay is based on the association between two nonfluorescent fragments of a fluorescent protein when they are brought in proximity to each other by an interaction between proteins fused to the fragments. Numerous protein interactions have been visualized using the BiFC assay in many different cell types and organisms. The BiFC assay is technically straightforward and can be performed using standard molecular biology and cell culture reagents and a regular fluorescence microscope or flow cytometer.

Bimolecular fluorescence complementation (BiFC) analysis enables direct visualization of protein interactions in living cells. The BiFC assay is based on the discoveries that two non-fluorescent fragments of a fluorescent protein can form a fluorescent complex and that the association of the fragments can be facilitated when they are fused to two proteins that interact with each other. BiFC must be confirmed by parallel analysis of proteins in which the interaction interface has been mutated. It is not necessary for the interaction partners to juxtapose the fragments within a specific distance of each other because they can associate when they are tethered to a complex with flexible linkers. It is also not necessary for the interaction partners to form a complex with a long half-life or a high occupancy since the fragments can associate in a transient complex and un-associated fusion proteins do not interfere with detection of the complex. Many interactions can be visualized when the fusion proteins are expressed at levels comparable to their endogenous counterparts. The BiFC assay has been used for the visualization of interactions between many types of proteins in different subcellular locations and in different cell types and organisms. It is technically straightforward and can be performed using a regular fluorescence microscope and standard molecular biology and cell culture reagents.

Bimolecular fluorescence complementation (BiFC) is a powerful method for studying protein-protein interactions in different cell types and organisms. This method was recently developed in the fruit fly Drosophila melanogaster, allowing analyzing protein interaction properties in a physiologically relevant developing context. Here we present a detailed protocol for performing BiFC with the Venus fluorescent protein in live Drosophila embryos, taking the Hox-PBC partnership as an illustrative test case. This protocol applies to any transcription factor and split fluorescent protein in general.

Bimolecular fluorescence complementation (BiFC) is a technique to visualize protein-protein interactions in living cells, and has been widely used in various model organisms. The principle of the BiFC assay is based on the reconstitution of an intact fluorescent protein. The two non-fluorescent fragments are fused to proteins of interest that may interact. If the two proteins interact, the two non-fluorescent fragments are brought together to reconstitute an intact fluorescent protein. The purpose of this protocol is to calculate signal-to-noise (S/N) ratio in the bimolecular fluorescence complementation (BiFC) assay and to provide a semi-quantitative analysis of protein-protein interaction (PPI) in living cells.

Protein-protein interactions (PPIs) play crucial roles in various biological processes. Among biochemical, genetic, and imaging approaches that have been used for the study of PPIs, visualization of PPIs in living cells is the key to understanding their cellular functions. The bimolecular fluorescence complementation (BiFC) assay represents one of these imaging tools for direct visualization of PPIs in living cells. The BiFC assay is based on the structural complementation of two nonfluorescent N- and C-terminal fragments of a fluorescent protein when they are fused to a pair of interacting proteins. Although over 10 different fluorescent proteins have been used for BiFC assays, the two nonfluorescent fragments from all of these fluorescent proteins can spontaneously self-assemble, which contributes to background fluorescence and decreases the signal-to-noise (S/N) ratio in the BiFC assay. Here we report the identification of a mutation, I152L, that can specifically reduce self-assembly and decrease background fluorescence in a Venus-based BiFC system. This mutation allows a 4-fold increase in the S/N ratio of the BiFC assay in living cells. This improved Venus-based BiFC system will facilitate PPI studies in various biological research fields.

Protein interactions control the regulatory networks underlying developmental processes. The understanding of developmental complexity will, therefore, require the characterization of protein interactions within their proper environment. The bimolecular fluorescence complementation (BiFC) technology offers this possibility as it enables the direct visualization of protein interactions in living cells. However, its potential has rarely been applied in embryos of animal model organisms and was only performed under transient protein expression levels. Using a Hox protein partnership as a test case, we investigated the suitability of BiFC for the study of protein interactions in the living Drosophila embryo. Importantly, all BiFC parameters were established with constructs that were stably expressed under the control of endogenous promoters. Under these physiological conditions, we showed that BiFC is specific and sensitive enough to analyse dynamic protein interactions. We next used BiFC in a candidate interaction screen, which led to the identification of several Hox protein partners. Our results establish the general suitability of BiFC for revealing and studying protein interactions in their physiological context during the rapid course of Drosophila embryonic development.

The bimolecular fluorescence complementation (BiFC) assay has been widely accepted for studying in vivo detection of protein-protein interactions in several organisms. To facilitate the application of the BiFC assay to yeast research, we have created a series of plasmids that allow single-step, PCR-based C- or N-terminal tagging of yeast proteins with yellow fluorescent protein fragments for BiFC assay. By examination of several interacting proteins (Sis1-Sis1, Net1-Sir2, Cet1-Cet1 and Pho2-Pho4), we demonstrate that the BiFC assay can be used to reliably analyse the occurrence and subcellular localization of protein-protein interactions in living yeast cells. The sequences for the described plasmids were submitted to the GenBank under Accession Nos: EF210802, pFA6a-VN-His3MX6; EF210803, pFA6a-VC-His3MX6; EF210804, pFA6a-VN-TRP1; EF210807, pFA6a-VC-TRP1; EF210808, pFA6a-VN-kanMX6; EF210809, pFA6a-VC-kanMX6; EF210810, pFA6a-His3MX6-P(GAL1)-VN; EF210805, pFA6a-His3MX6-P(GAL1)-VC; EF210806, pFA6a-TRP1-P(GAL1)-VN; EF210811, pFA6a-TRP1-P(GAL1)-VC; EF210812, pFA6a-kanMX6-P(GAL1)-VN; EF210813, pFA6a-kanMX6-P(GAL1)-VC; EF521883, pFA6a-His3MX6-P(CET1)-VN; EF521884, pFA6a-His3MX6-P(CET1)-VC; EF521885, pFA6a-TRP1-P(CET1)-VN; EF521886, pFA6a-TRP1-P(CET1)-VC; EF521887, pFA6a-kanMX6-P(CET1)-VN; EF521888, pFA6a-kanMX6-P(CET1)-VC.
