Precise expression patterns of genes in time and space are essential for proper development of multicellular organisms. Dynamic chromatin conformation and spatial organization of the genome constitute a major step in this regulation to modulate developmental outputs. Polycomb repressive complexes (PRCs) mediate stable or flexible gene repression in response to internal and environmental cues. In Arabidopsis thaliana, LHP1 co-localizes with H3K27me3 epigenetic marks throughout the genome and interacts with PRC1 and PRC2 members as well as with a long noncoding RNA. Here, we show that LHP1 is responsible for the spreading of H3K27me3 towards the 3' end of the gene body. We also identified a subset of LHP1-activated genes and demonstrated that LHP1 shapes local chromatin topology in order to control transcriptional co-regulation. Our work reveals a general role of LHP1 from local to higher conformation levels of chromatin configuration to determine its accessibility to define gene expression patterns.

Polycomb repressive complex 1 (PRC1) is required for ubiquitination of histone H2A lysine 119, an epigenetic mark associated with repression of genes important in developmental regulation. The E3 ligase activity of PRC1 resides in the RING1A/B subunit when paired with one of six PCGF partners. The best known of these is the oncogene BMI1/PCGF4. We find that canonical PRC1 E3 ligases such as PCGF4-RING1B have intrinsically very low enzymatic activity compared with non-canonical PRC1 RING dimers. The structure of a high-activity variant in complex with E2 (PCGF5-RING1B-UbcH5c) reveals only subtle differences from an earlier PCGF4 complex structure. However, two charged residues present in the modelled interface with E2-conjugated ubiquitin prove critical: in BMI1/PCGF4, these residues form a salt bridge that may limit efficient ubiquitin transfer. The intrinsically low activity of the PCGF4-RING1B heterodimer is offset by a relatively favourable interaction with nucleosome substrates, resulting in an efficient site-specific monoubiquitination.

We have recently reported that the protein ZRF1 specifically binds to monoubiquitinated histone H2A and derepresses Polycomb target genes at the onset of cellular differentiation. Our results suggest that ZRF1 exerts its function in a two-step mechanism, by initially displacing the Polycomb-repressive complex 1 (PRC1) from chromatin and subsequently acting together with histone H2A-specific deubiquitinases to facilitate transcriptional activation of its target genes. These findings demonstrate an ambiguity of the epigenetic monoubiquitin mark at histone H2A. Once considered to be a hallmark of gene silencing, it is now clear that this mark can also be utilized as a recruitment platform for proteins engaged in gene activation. Genome-wide analyses demonstrate that ZRF1 is recruited to typical Polycomb target genes, thereby putting it in a position to have an impact on differentiation and animal development. This molecular mechanism for ZRF1 may represent one of the first steps in switching silenced genes to a transcriptionally active state. We discuss here our recent findings in the light of progress made in understanding Polycomb-mediated silencing.

The correlation between DNA methylation and a subset of histone post-translational modifications (positive and negative) has hinted at an underlying regulatory crosstalk between histone marks and DNA methylation in patterning the human DNA methylome, an idea further supported by corresponding alterations to both histone marks and DNA methylation during malignant transformation. This study investigated the framework by which histone marks influence DNA methylation at a genome-wide level. Using RNAi in a pluripotent human embryonic carcinoma cell line we depleted essential components of the MLL/COMPASS, polycomb repressive complex 2 (PRC2), and PRC1 histone modifying complexes that establish, respectively, the post-translational modifications H3K4me3, H3K27me3, and H2AK119ub, and assayed the impact of the subsequent depletion of these marks on the DNA methylome. Absence of H2AK119ub resulted predominantly in hypomethylation across the genome. Depletion of H3K4me3 and, surprisingly, H3K27me3 caused CpG island hypermethylation at a subset of loci. Intriguingly, many promoters were co-regulated by all three histone marks, becoming hypermethylated with loss of H3K4me3 or H3K27me3 and hypomethylated with depletion of H2AK119ub, and many of these co-regulated loci were among those commonly targeted for aberrant hypermethylation in cancer. Taken together, our results elucidate novel roles for polycomb and MLL/COMPASS in regulating DNA methylation and define targets of this regulation.

The INK4/ARF locus encodes three tumor suppressor genes (p15(Ink4b), Arf and p16(Ink4a)) and is frequently inactivated in a large number of human cancers. Mechanisms regulating INK4/ARF expression are not fully characterized. Here we show that in young proliferating embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) the Polycomb Repressive Complex 2 (PRC2) member EZH2 together with PRC1 members BMI1 and M33 are strongly expressed and localized at the INK4/ARF regulatory domain (RD) identified as a DNA replication origin. When cells enter senescence the binding to RD of both PRC1 and PRC2 complexes is lost leading to a decreased level of histone H3K27 trimethylation (H3K27me3). This loss is accompanied with an increased expression of the histone demethylase Jmjd3 and with the recruitment of the MLL1 protein, and correlates with the expression of the Ink4a/Arf genes. Moreover, we show that the Polycomb protein BMI1 interacts with CDC6, an essential regulator of DNA replication in eukaryotic cells. Finally, we demonstrate that Polycomb proteins and associated epigenetic marks are crucial for the control of the replication timing of the INK4a/ARF locus during senescence. We identified the replication licencing factor CDC6 as a new partner of the Polycomb group member BMI1. Our results suggest that in young cells Polycomb proteins are recruited to the INK4/ARF locus through CDC6 and the resulting silent locus is replicated during late S-phase. Upon senescence, Jmjd3 is overexpressed and the MLL1 protein is recruited to the locus provoking the dissociation of Polycomb from the INK4/ARF locus, its transcriptional activation and its replication during early S-phase. Together, these results provide a unified model that integrates replication, transcription and epigenetics at the INK4/ARF locus.

Polycomb group (PcG) proteins constitute a major epigenetic mechanism for gene repression throughout the plant life. For a long time, the PcG mechanism has been proposed to follow a hierarchical recruitment of PcG repressive complexes (PRCs) to target genes in which the binding of PRC2 and the incorporation of H3 lysine 27 trimethyl marks led to recruitment of PRC1, which in turn mediated H2A monoubiquitination. However, recent studies have turned this model upside-down by showing that PRC1 activity can be required for PRC2 recruitment and H3K27me3 marking. Here, we review the current knowledge on plant PRC1 composition and mechanisms of repression, as well as its role during plant development.

Histone H2A monoubiquitination (H2Aub1), catalyzed by Polycomb-Repressive Complex1 (PRC1), is a key epigenetic mark in Polycomb silencing. However, little is known about how H2Aub1 is read to exert downstream physiological functions. The animal ZUOTIN-RELATED FACTOR1 (ZRF1) has been reported to bind H2Aub1 to promote or repress the expression of varied target genes. Here, we show that the Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana) ZRF1 homologs, AtZRF1a and AtZRF1b, are key regulators of multiple processes during plant growth and development. Loss of function of both AtZRF1a and AtZRF1b in atzrf1a atzrf1b mutants causes seed germination delay, small plant size, abnormal meristem activity, abnormal flower development, as well as gametophyte transmission and embryogenesis defects. Some of these defects overlap with those described previously in the PRC1-defective mutants atbmi1a atbmi1b and atring1a atring1b, but others are specific to atzrf1a atzrf1b In line with this, 4,519 genes (representing more than 14% of all genes) within the Arabidopsis genome are found differentially expressed in atzrf1a atzrf1b seedlings, and among them, 114 genes are commonly up-regulated in atring1a atring1b and atbmi1a atbmi1b Finally, we show that in both atzrf1a atzrf1b and atbmi1a atbmi1b seedlings, the seed developmental genes ABSCISIC ACID INSENSITIVE3, CRUCIFERIN3, and CHOTTO1 are derepressed, in association with the reduced levels of H2Aub1 and histone H3 lysine-27 trimethylation (H3K27me3). Collectively, our results indicate that AtZRF1a/b play both PRC1-related and PRC1-unrelated functions in regulating plant growth and development and that AtZRF1a/b promote H2Aub1 and H3K27me3 deposition in gene suppression. Our work provides novel insight into the mechanisms of function of this family of evolutionarily conserved chromatin regulators.

In embryonic stem (ES) cells, bivalent chromatin domains with overlapping repressive (H3 lysine 27 tri-methylation) and activating (H3 lysine 4 tri-methylation) histone modifications mark the promoters of more than 2,000 genes. To gain insight into the structure and function of bivalent domains, we mapped key histone modifications and subunits of Polycomb-repressive complexes 1 and 2 (PRC1 and PRC2) genomewide in human and mouse ES cells by chromatin immunoprecipitation, followed by ultra high-throughput sequencing. We find that bivalent domains can be segregated into two classes -- the first occupied by both PRC2 and PRC1 (PRC1-positive) and the second specifically bound by PRC2 (PRC2-only). PRC1-positive bivalent domains appear functionally distinct as they more efficiently retain lysine 27 tri-methylation upon differentiation, show stringent conservation of chromatin state, and associate with an overwhelming number of developmental regulator gene promoters. We also used computational genomics to search for sequence determinants of Polycomb binding. This analysis revealed that the genomewide locations of PRC2 and PRC1 can be largely predicted from the locations, sizes, and underlying motif contents of CpG islands. We propose that large CpG islands depleted of activating motifs confer epigenetic memory by recruiting the full repertoire of Polycomb complexes in pluripotent cells.

Centromeres are characterized by the centromere-specific H3 variant CENP-A, which is embedded in chromatin with a pattern characteristic of active transcription that is required for centromere identity. It is unclear how centromeres remain transcriptionally active despite being flanked by repressive pericentric heterochromatin. To further understand centrochromatin's response to repressive signals, we nucleated a Polycomb-like chromatin state within the centromere of a human artificial chromosome (HAC) by tethering the methyltransferase EZH2. This led to deposition of the H3K27me3 mark and PRC1 repressor binding. Surprisingly, this state did not abolish HAC centromere function or transcription, and this apparent resistance was not observed on a noncentromeric locus, where transcription was silenced. Directly tethering the reader/repressor PRC1 bypassed this resistance, inactivating the centromere. We observed analogous responses when tethering the heterochromatin Editor Suv39h1-methyltransferase domain (centromere resistance) or reader HP1α (centromere inactivation), respectively. Our results reveal that the HAC centromere can resist repressive pathways driven by H3K9me3/H3K27me3 and may help to explain how centromeres are able to resist inactivation by flanking heterochromatin.

Polycomb group (PcG) proteins are crucial epigenetic regulators conferring transcriptional memory to cell lineages. They assemble into multi-protein complexes, e.g., Polycomb Repressive Complex 1 and 2 (PRC1, PRC2), which are thought to act in a sequential manner to stably maintain gene repression. PRC2 induces histone H3 lysine 27 (H3K27) trimethylation (H3K27me3), which is subsequently read by PRC1 that further catalyzes H2A monoubiquitination (H2Aub1), creating a transcriptional silent chromatin conformation. PRC2 components are conserved in plants and have been extensively characterized in Arabidopsis. In contrast, PRC1 composition and function are more diverged between animals and plants. Only more recently, PRC1 existence in plants has been documented. Here we review the aspects of plant specific and conserved PRC1 and highlight critical roles of PRC1 components in seed embryonic trait determinacy, shoot stem cell fate determinacy, and flower development in Arabidopsis.
