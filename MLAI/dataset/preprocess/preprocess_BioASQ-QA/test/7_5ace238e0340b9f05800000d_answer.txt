IDEAL_ANSWER:
- The evolution of African great ape subtelomeric heterochromatin and the fusion of human chromosome 2. We propose a model where an ancestral human-chimpanzee pericentric inversion and the ancestral chromosome 2 fusion both predisposed and protected the chimpanzee and human genomes, respectively, to the formation of subtelomeric heterochromatin. 
- The evolution of African great ape subtelomeric heterochromatin and the fusion of human chromosome 2.
- Origin of human chromosome 2: an ancestral telomere-telomere fusion.
- Human chromosome 2 originated from the fusion of two ancestral primate chromosomes.
- Origin of human chromosome 2: an ancestral telomere-telomere fusion. It is known that human chromosome 2 originated from the fusion of two ancestral primate chromosomes. 
- The evolution of African great ape subtelomeric heterochromatin and the fusion of human chromosome 2.
