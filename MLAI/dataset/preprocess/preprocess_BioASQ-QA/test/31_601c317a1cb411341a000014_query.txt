[PMID: 31287230]
To evaluate the efficacy, including capacity for inhibition of radiographic progression, and safety of upadacitinib, a JAK1-selective inhibitor, as compared to placebo or adalimumab in patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA) who have experienced an inadequate response to methotrexate (MTX). In total, 1,629 RA patients with an inadequate response to MTX were randomized (2:2:1) to receive upadacitinib (15 mg once daily), placebo, or adalimumab (40 mg every other week) while continuing to take a stable background dose of MTX. The primary end points were achievement of an American College of Rheumatology 20% (ACR20) improvement response and a Disease Activity Score in 28 joints using C-reactive protein level (DAS28-CRP) of <2.6 in the upadacitinib group compared to the placebo group at week 12; inhibition of radiographic progression was evaluated at week 26. The study was also designed and powered to test for the noninferiority and superiority of upadacitinib compared to adalimumab, as measured both clinically and functionally. At week 12, both primary end points were met in patients receiving upadacitinib compared to those receiving placebo (P ≤ 0.001). An ACR20 improvement response was achieved by 71% of patients in the upadacitinib group compared to 36% in the placebo group, and a DAS28-CRP score of <2.6 was observed in 29% of patients receiving upadacitinib compared to 6% of patients receiving placebo. Upadacitinib was superior to adalimumab based on the ACR50 response rate, achievement of a DAS28-CRP score of ≤3.2, change in pain severity score, and change in the Health Assessment Questionnaire disability index. At week 26, more patients receiving upadacitinib than those receiving placebo or adalimumab achieved low disease activity or remission (P ≤ 0.001). Radiographic progression was significantly inhibited in patients receiving upadacitinib and was observed in fewer upadacitinib-treated patients than placebo-treated patients (P ≤ 0.001). Up to week 26, adverse events (AEs), including serious infections, were comparable between the upadacitinib and adalimumab groups. The proportions of patients with serious AEs and AEs leading to discontinuation were highest in the adalimumab group; the proportions of patients with herpes zoster and those with creatine phosphokinase (CPK) elevations were highest in the upadacitinib group. Three malignancies, 5 major adverse cardiovascular events, and 4 deaths were reported among the groups, but none occurred in patients receiving upadacitinib. Six venous thromboembolic events were reported (1 in the placebo group, 2 in the upadacitinib group, and 3 in the adalimumab group). Upadacitinib was superior to placebo and adalimumab for improving signs, symptoms, and physical function in RA patients who were receiving background MTX. In addition, radiographic progression was significantly inhibited by upadacitinib as compared to placebo. The overall safety profile of upadacitinib was generally similar to that of adalimumab, except for higher rates of herpes zoster and CPK elevations in patients receiving upadacitinib.

Inhibition of Janus kinases [JAKs] in Crohn's disease [CD] patients has shown conflicting results in clinical trials. Tofacitinib, a pan-JAK inhibitor, showed efficacy in ulcerative colitis [UC] and has been approved for the treatment of patients with moderate to severe UC. In contrast, studies in CD patients were disappointing and the primary end point of clinical remission could not be met in the respective phase II induction and maintenance trials. Subsequently, the clinical development of tofacitinib was discontinued in CD. In contrast, efficacy of filgotinib, a selective JAK1 inhibitor, in CD patients was demonstrated in the randomized, double-blinded, placebo-controlled phase II FITZROY study. Upadacitinib also showed promising results in a phase II trial in moderate to severe CD. Subsequently, phase III programmes in CD have been initiated for both substances, which are still ongoing. Several newer molecules of this class of orally administrated immunosuppressants are being tested in clinical programmes. The concern of side effects of systemic JAK inhibition is addressed by either exclusively intestinal action or higher selectivity [Tyk2 inhibitors]. In general, JAK inhibitors constitute a new promising class of drugs for the treatment of CD.

Upadacitinib is a Janus kinase 1 inhibitor developed for treatment of moderate to severe rheumatoid arthritis (RA) and was recently approved by the US Food and Drug Administration for this indication in adults who have had an inadequate response or intolerance to methotrexate. Upadacitinib is currently under regulatory review by other agencies around the world. Ongoing trials are investigating the use of upadacitinib in other inflammatory autoimmune diseases. In this article, we review the clinical pharmacokinetic data available to date for upadacitinib that supported the clinical development program in RA and ultimately regulatory applications for upadacitinib in treatment of patients with moderate to severe RA.

Upadacitinib is a Janus kinase 1 inhibitor under development for the treatment of several inflammatory disorders including rheumatoid arthritis (RA). Upadacitinib was administered in the phase 2 RA trials primarily as twice-daily regimens of an immediate-release (IR) formulation. The upadacitinib extended-release (ER) formulation was developed to enable once-daily dosing. In the present study, upadacitinib pharmacokinetics were characterized after the administration of single and multiple once-daily doses of the ER formulation in healthy subjects relative to single and multiple twice-daily doses of the IR formulation. Increase in upadacitinib exposure was dose-proportional over the evaluated 15- to 30-mg ER dose range. Single 15- and 30-mg ER doses provided equivalent AUC<sub>0-inf</sub> compared with single 12- and 24-mg IR doses, respectively. A high-fat breakfast increased upadacitinib ER C<sub>max</sub> and AUC<sub>0-inf</sub> by only 20% and 17%, respectively, relative to fasting conditions. The median time to peak plasma concentrations was 2 to 4 hours for the ER formulation, and steady state was achieved by day 4 of once-daily dosing. Doses of 15 and 30 mg once daily using the ER formulation provided equivalent AUC<sub>0-24</sub> , comparable C<sub>max</sub> and C<sub>min</sub> , and a fluctuation index over a 24-hour period at steady state similar to 6 and 12 mg twice daily, respectively, using the IR formulation. These results supported the use of upadacitinib 15- and 30-mg doses of the ER formulation in the phase 3 trials in RA.

Upadacitinib, an oral Janus kinase (JAK)1-selective inhibitor, showed efficacy in combination with stable background conventional synthetic disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs (csDMARDs) in patients with rheumatoid arthritis who had an inadequate response to DMARDs. We aimed to evaluate the safety and efficacy of upadacitinib monotherapy after switching from methotrexate versus continuing methotrexate in patients with inadequate response to methotrexate. SELECT-MONOTHERAPY was conducted at 138 sites in 24 countries. The study enrolled adults (≥18 years) who fulfilled the 2010 American College of Rheumatology (ACR)-European League Against Rheumatism (EULAR) classification criteria for rheumatoid arthritis. Patients with active rheumatoid arthritis despite stable methotrexate were randomly assigned 2:2:1:1 to switch to once-daily monotherapy of of upadacitinib or to continue methotrexate at their existing dose as blinded study drug; starting from week 14, patients assigned to continue methotrexate were switched to 15 mg or 30 mg once-daily upadacitinib per prespecified random assignment at baseline. The primary endpoints in this report are proportion of patients achieving 20% improvement in the ACR criteria (ACR20) at week 14, and proportion achieving low disease activity defined as 28-joint Disease Activity Score using C-reactive protein (DAS28[CRP]) of 3·2 or lower, both with non-responder imputation at week 14. Outcomes were assessed in patients who received at least one dose of study drug. This study is active but not recruiting and is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT02706951. Patients were screened between Feb 23, 2016, and May 19, 2017 and 648 were randomly assigned to treatment. 598 (92%) completed week 14. At week 14, an ACR20 response was achieved by 89 (41%) of 216 patients (95% CI 35-48) in the continued methotrexate group, 147 (68%) of 217 patients (62-74) receiving upadacitinib 15 mg, and 153 (71%) of 215 patients (65-77) receiving upadacitinib 30 mg (p<0·0001 for both doses vs continued methotrexate). DAS28(CRP) 3·2 or lower was met by 42 (19%) of 216 (95% CI 14-25) in the continued methotrexate group, 97 (45%) of 217 (38-51) receiving upadacitinib 15 mg, and 114 (53%) of 215 (46-60) receiving upadacitinib 30 mg (p<0·0001 for both doses vs continued methotrexate). Adverse events were reported in 102 patients (47%) on continued methotrexate, 103 (47%) on upadacitinib 15 mg, and 105 (49%) on upadacitinib 30 mg. Herpes zoster was reported by one (<1%) patient on continued methotrexate, three (1%) on upadacitinib 15 mg, and six (3%) on upadacitinib 30 mg. Three malignancies (one [<1%] on continued methotrexate, two [1%] on upadacitinib 15 mg), three adjudicated major adverse cardiovascular events (one [<1%] on upadacitinib 15 mg, two [<1%] on upadacitinib 30 mg), one adjudicated pulmonary embolism (<1%; upadacitinib 15 mg), and one death (<1%; upadacitinib 15 mg, haemorrhagic stroke [ruptured aneurysm]) were reported in the study. Upadacitinib monotherapy showed statistically significant improvements in clinical and functional outcomes versus continuing methotrexate in this methotrexate inadequate-responder population. Safety observations were similar to those in previous upadacitinib rheumatoid arthritis studies. AbbVie Inc, USA.

Upadacitinib is a selective Janus kinase 1 inhibitor being developed for the treatment of several inflammatory autoimmune diseases, including rheumatoid arthritis. Upadacitinib is a nonsensitive substrate for metabolism by cytochrome P450 3A enzymes. This open-label, single-dose, multicenter study assessed the pharmacokinetics of upadacitinib following oral administration of a single 15-mg dose of the upadacitinib extended-release formulation in subjects with mild (n = 6) and moderate (n = 6) hepatic impairment relative to demographically matched healthy subjects (n = 6). Subjects were assigned to 1 of the 3 groups according to the Child-Pugh classification. Relative to subjects with normal hepatic function, the ratios (90% confidence intervals) of upadacitinib area under the plasma concentration-versus-time profile from time 0 to infinity (AUC<sub>inf</sub> ) for subjects with mild and moderate hepatic impairment were 1.28 (0.91-1.79) and 1.24 (0.87-1.76), respectively. The central ratios of upadacitinib maximum observed concentration (C<sub>max</sub> ) were 1.04 (0.77-1.39) and 1.43 (1.05-1.95) in subjects with mild and moderate hepatic impairment, respectively, compared with subjects with normal hepatic function. No clinically significant changes in vital signs or hematology measurements were observed, and no new safety events were identified in this study. These results indicate that mild and moderate hepatic impairment has no clinically relevant effect on upadacitinib pharmacokinetics.

Upadacitinib is a selective Janus Kinase 1 inhibitor which is being developed for the treatment of several inflammatory diseases including rheumatoid arthritis. Upadacitinib was evaluated in Phase 3 studies as an oral extended-release (ER) formulation administered once daily. The purpose of this study was to develop a level A in vitro-in vivo correlation (IVIVC) for upadacitinib ER formulation. The pharmacokinetics of four upadacitinib extended-release formulations with different in vitro release characteristics and an immediate-release capsule formulation of upadacitinib were evaluated in 20 healthy subjects in a single-dose, randomized, crossover study. In vivo pharmacokinetic data and in vitro dissolution data (USP Dissolution Apparatus 1; pH 6.8; 100 rpm) were used to establish a level A IVIVC. Three formulations were used to establish the IVIVC, and the fourth formulation was used for external validation. A non-linear IVIVC best described the relationship between upadacitinib in vitro dissolution and in vivo absorption profiles. The absolute percent prediction errors (%PE) for upadacitinib C<sub>max</sub> and AUC were less than 10% for all three formulations used to establish the IVIVC, as well as for the %PE for the external validation formulation and the overall mean internal validation. Model was cross-validated using the leave-one-out approach; all evaluated cross-validation runs met the regulatory acceptance criteria. A level A IVIVC was successfully developed and validated for upadacitinib ER formulation, which meets the FDA and EMA regulatory validation criteria and can be used as surrogate for in vivo bioequivalence.

Upadacitinib is a selective Janus kinase (JAK) 1 inhibitor being developed for treatment of rheumatoid arthritis. This study characterizes the relationships between upadacitinib exposure and interleukin (IL)-6-induced signal transducer and activator of transcription proteins 3 (STAT3) phosphorylation (pSTAT3) and IL-7-induced STAT5 phosphorylation (pSTAT5) in the ex vivo setting as measures for JAK1 and JAK1/JAK3 inhibition, respectively, with comparison to tofacitinib. Drug plasma concentrations and ex vivo IL-6-induced pSTAT3 and IL-7-induced pSTAT5 in blood from subjects evaluated in 2 phase 1 studies who received immediate-release 1 mg to 48 mg upadacitinib, 5 mg twice daily (BID) tofacitinib, or placebo were determined. Exposure-response models were developed, and the effects of different upadacitinib doses on ex vivo biomarker responses were simulated and compared to tofacitinib. Upadacitinib (and tofacitinib) reversibly inhibited IL-6-induced pSTAT3 and IL-7-induced pSTAT5 in a concentration-dependent manner. Model-estimated values of 50% of the maximum effect were 60.7 nM for upadacitinib and 119 nM for tofacitinib for IL-6-induced pSTAT3 inhibition, and 125 nM for upadacitinib and 79.1 nM for tofacitinib for IL-7-induced pSTAT5 inhibition. Tofacitinib 5 mg BID is estimated to have a similar magnitude of effect on IL-6-induced pSTAT3 to ∼3 mg BID of upadacitinib (immediate-release formulation), whereas a 4-fold higher dose of upadacitinib (∼12 mg BID), is estimated to show a similar magnitude of inhibition on IL-7-induced pSTAT5 as tofacitinb 5 mg BID. This study confirms that in humans, upadacitinib has greater selectivity for JAK1 vs JAK3 relative to the rheumatoid arthritis approved dose of tofacitinib, and results from these analyses informed the selection of upadacitinib IR doses evaluated in phase 2.

Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is a chronic autoimmune inflammatory disease characterized by joint involvement, extra-articular manifestations, comorbidities, and increased mortality. In the last few decades, the management of RA has been dramatically improved by the introduction of a treat-to-target approach aiming to prevent joint damage progression. Moreover, the increasing knowledge about disease pathogenesis allowed the development of a new drug class of biologic agents targeted on immune cells and proinflammatory cytokines involved in RA network. Despite the introduction of several targeted drugs, a significant proportion of RA patients still fail to achieve the clinical target; so, more recently the focus of research has been shifted toward the inhibition of kinases involved in the transduction of the inflammatory signal into immune cells. In particular, two Janus kinase (JAK) inhibitors, baricitinib and tofacitinib, have been licensed for the treatment of RA as a consequence of a very favorable profile observed in randomized controlled trials (RCTs) conducted across different RA subpopulations. Both these new compounds are active on the majority of four JAK family members (JAK1, JAK2, JAK3, and TYK2), whereas the most recent emerging approach is directed toward the development of JAK1 selective inhibitors (upadacitinib and filgotinib) with the aim to improve the safety profile by minimizing the effects on JAK3 and, especially, JAK2. In this narrative review, we discuss the rationale for JAK inhibition in RA, with a special focus on the role of JAK1 selective blockade and a detailed description of available data from the results of clinical trials on upadacitinib and filgotinib.

Prior to the biologic era, the medical management of patients with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) was dominated by the use of aminosalicylates, corticosteroids, and immunosuppressants. In the past two decades, the advent of biologic agents that target specific components of the immune response has greatly improved the care of patients with Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis (UC). However, not all patients respond or maintain response to biologic therapy and some patients develop adverse events that necessitate treatment discontinuation. Furthermore, sensitization with formation of anti-drug antibodies is an inherent limitation to administration of monoclonal antibodies. This circumstance has generated renewed interest in the development of novel oral small-molecule drugs (SMDs) that are effective and well tolerated. Several classes of SMDs are currently progressing through the pipeline and offer the promise of oral delivery and high potency. In this review, we summarize different mechanisms of oral drug delivery to the gastrointestinal tract, highlight key findings from phase II and III randomized trials of novel oral SMDs, and discuss how oral SMDs are likely to be integrated into future IBD treatment paradigms. The most advanced development programs currently involve evaluation of compounds blocking Janus kinase (JAK) receptors or modulating sphingosine-1-phosphate (S1P) receptors. Tofacitinib, an oral JAK inhibitor, was recently approved for the treatment of moderate-to-severe UC. Several more selective JAK-1 inhibitors, including filgotinib and upadacitinib, have also shown positive results in phase II studies and are currently enrolling in phase III development programs. Similarly, ozanimod, an S1P1 and S1P5 receptor agonist, has shown early favorable results and is enrolling in phase III trials. As these and other novel oral SMDs come to market, several questions will need to be answered. The cost effectiveness, comparative treatment efficacy, predictors of response, and relative safety of oral SMDs compared to existing therapies will need to be evaluated. Given the modest efficacy rates observed with both biologic therapies and novel SMDs to date, the potential for combination therapy based on a non-sensitizing oral option is promising and may be facilitated by development of organ-specific therapies with pharmacodynamic activity restricted to the gut to minimize systemic toxicity.

The aim of this study was to characterize the effects of upadacitinib, a Janus kinase 1 inhibitor, on in vivo activity of different cytochrome P450 (CYP) enzymes using a cocktail approach. Healthy subjects (n = 20) received single oral doses of the modified Cooperstown 5+1 cocktail drugs (midazolam [CYP3A], caffeine [CYP1A2], warfarin + vitamin K [CYP2C9], omeprazole [CYP2C19], and dextromethorphan [CYP2D6]) without upadacitinib and on day 11 (midazolam) or 12 (all other probes) of a 15-day regimen of upadacitinib 30 mg once daily (extended-release formulation). Serial blood samples and 12-hour urine samples were collected for assays of the probe substrates and select metabolites. The ratio (90%CI) of area under the plasma concentration-time curve from time 0 to infinity (AUC<sub>inf</sub> ) central values when the cocktail drugs were administered with upadacitinib relative to when administered alone were 0.74 (0.68-0.80) for midazolam, 1.22 (1.15-1.29) for caffeine, 1.11 (1.07-1.15) for S-warfarin, 1.07 (0.95-1.22) for dextromethorphan, and 0.82 (0.72-0.94) for omeprazole. The ratio (90%CI) was 1.09 (1.00-1.19) for 5-hydroxy-omeprazole to omeprazole AUC<sub>inf</sub> ratio and 1.17 (0.97-1.41) for dextromethorphan to dextrorphan 12-hour molar urinary ratio. Upadacitinib 30 mg once daily (a dose that is twice the optimal dose in rheumatoid arthritis based on phase 3 results) has a limited effect on CYP3A activity (26% decrease in exposure of midazolam, a sensitive CYP3A substrate) and no relevant effects on CYP1A2, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, or CYP2D6 activity in vivo. No clinically relevant changes in plasma exposures are expected for drugs that are substrates for the evaluated CYP enzymes when coadministered with upadacitinib.

This phase 1 study characterized the effect of multiple doses of upadacitinib, an oral Janus kinase 1 selective inhibitor, on the pharmacokinetics of the cytochrome P450 (CYP) 2B6 substrate bupropion. Healthy subjects (n = 22) received a single oral dose of bupropion 150 mg alone (study period 1) and on day 12 of a 16-day regimen of upadacitinib 30 mg once daily (study period 2). Serial blood samples for measurement of bupropion and hydroxybupropion plasma concentrations were collected in each study period. The central values (90% confidence intervals) for the ratios of change were 0.87 (0.79-0.96) for bupropion maximum plasma concentration (C<sub>max</sub> ), 0.92 (0.87-0.98) for bupropion area under the plasma-concentration time curve from time 0 to infinity (AUC<sub>inf</sub> ), 0.78 (0.72-0.85) for hydroxybupropion C<sub>max</sub> , and 0.72 (0.67-0.78) for hydroxybupropion AUC<sub>inf</sub> when administered with, relative to when administered without, upadacitinib. After multiple-dose administration of upadacitinib 30 mg once daily, upadacitinib mean ± SD AUC<sub>0-24</sub> was 641 ± 177 ng·h/mL, and C<sub>max</sub> was 83.3 ± 30.7 ng/mL. These results confirm that upadacitinib has no relevant effect on pharmacokinetics of substrates metabolized by CYP2B6.

Atopic dermatitis is a common, chronic, immune-mediated disease associated with several comorbidities. Elevated levels of T helper (Th)2, Th22, and also some Th1 and Th17 cytokines are found in atopic dermatitis skin lesions. Similar to psoriasis, there is a tendency towards increased use of more targeted therapies. However, there are still several unmet needs in the treatment of atopic dermatitis concerning long-term efficacy, tolerability, safety, route of administration, and cost. The increased knowledge of atopic dermatitis pathogenesis and the role of Janus kinase/signal transducer and activator of transcription (JAK/STAT) pathways has allowed the development of new compounds to inhibit this intracellular signaling pathway implicated in atopic dermatitis-related immune responses. Currently, JAK inhibitors are an important focus of therapeutic research for atopic dermatitis. Upadacitinib and abrocitinib are oral small molecules that inhibit the JAK/STAT pathway by selectively blocking JAK1. Data from phase II and III trials are encouraging, revealing that JAK1 inhibitors are effective and well-tolerated agents for moderate-to-severe atopic dermatitis. Selective JAK1 inhibitors may represent an important therapeutic option to be included in the treatment algorithm of atopic dermatitis, owing to oral administration and a favorable safety and tolerability profile. In this article, we review the current evidence on the efficacy and safety of oral selective JAK1 inhibitors for the treatment of atopic dermatitis.

We evaluated the efficacy and safety of upadacitinib, an oral selective Janus kinase 1 inhibitor, in a randomized trial of patients with Crohn's disease (CD). We performed a double-blind, phase 2 trial in adults with moderate to severe CD and inadequate response or intolerance to immunosuppressants or tumor necrosis factor antagonists. Patients were randomly assigned (1:1:1:1:1:1) to groups given placebo; or 3 mg, 6 mg, 12 mg, or 24 mg upadacitinib twice daily; or 24 mg upadacitinib once daily and were evaluated by ileocolonoscopy at weeks 12 or 16 of the induction period. Patients who completed week 16 were re-randomized to a 36-week period of maintenance therapy with upadacitinib. The primary endpoints were clinical remission at week 16 and endoscopic remission at week 12 or 16 using the multiple comparison procedure and modeling and the Cochran-Mantel-Haenszel test, with a 2-sided level of 10%. Among the 220 patients in the study, clinical remission was achieved by 13% of patients receiving 3 mg upadacitinib, 27% of patients receiving 6 mg upadacitinib (P < .1 vs placebo), 11% of patients receiving 12 mg upadacitinib, and 22% of patients receiving 24 mg upadacitinib twice daily, and by 14% of patients receiving 24 mg upadacitinib once daily, vs 11% of patients receiving placebo. Endoscopic remission was achieved by 10% (P < .1 vs placebo), 8%, 8% (P < .1 vs placebo), 22% (P < .01 vs placebo), and 14% (P < .05 vs placebo) of patients receiving upadacitinib, respectively, vs none of the patients receiving placebo. Endoscopic but not clinical remission increased with dose during the induction period. Efficacy was maintained for most endpoints through week 52. During the induction period, patients in the upadacitinib groups had higher incidences of infections and serious infections vs placebo. Patients in the twice-daily 12 mg and 24 mg upadacitinib groups had significant increases in total, high-density lipoprotein, and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels compared with patients in the placebo group. In a phase 2 trial of patients with CD, upadacitinib induced endoscopic remission in a significant proportion of patients compared with placebo. Upadacitinib's benefit/risk profile supports further development for treatment of CD. (Clinicaltrials.gov, Number: NCT02365649).

Atopic dermatitis is a chronic inflammatory skin disease characterized by pruritic skin lesions. We sought to evaluate the safety and efficacy of multiple doses of the selective Janus kinase 1 inhibitor upadacitinib in patients with moderate to severe atopic dermatitis. In the 16-week, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel-group, dose-ranging portion of this 88-week trial in 8 countries (ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT02925117; ongoing, not recruiting), adults with moderate to severe disease and inadequate control by topical treatment were randomized 1:1:1:1, using an interactive response system and stratified geographically, to once-daily upadacitinib oral monotherapy 7.5, 15, or 30 mg or placebo. The primary end point was percentage improvement in Eczema Area and Severity Index from baseline at week 16. Efficacy was analyzed by intention-to-treat in all randomized patients. Safety was analyzed in all randomized patients who received study medication, based on actual treatment. Patients (N = 167) enrolled from November 21, 2016, to April 20, 2017. All were randomized and analyzed for efficacy (each upadacitinib group, n = 42; placebo, n = 41); 166 were analyzed for safety (each upadacitinib group, n = 42; placebo, n = 40). The mean (SE) primary efficacy end point was 39% (6.2%), 62% (6.1%), and 74% (6.1%) for the upadacitinib 7.5-, 15-, and 30-mg groups, respectively, versus 23% (6.4%) for placebo (P = .03, <.001, and <.001). Serious adverse events occurred in 4.8% (2 of 42), 2.4% (1 of 42), and 0% (0 of 42) of upadacitinib groups (vs 2.5% [1 of 40] for placebo). A dose-response relationship was observed for upadacitinib efficacy; the 30-mg once-daily dose showed the greatest clinical benefit. Dose-limiting toxicity was not observed.

Exposure-response analyses of QT data from early-stage clinical studies represent a valuable tool to assess the QT prolongation potential for drugs in development in lieu of standalone thorough QT (TQT) studies. However, demonstrating adequate electrocardiogram assay sensitivity can be challenging in the absence of a positive pharmacological control. Upadacitinib is a Janus kinase 1 inhibitor currently being evaluated in phase III rheumatoid arthritis trials. Exposure-response analyses to evaluate the QT prolongation potential for upadacitinib from phase I trials and the utility of the effect of food on QTcF to demonstrate ECG assay sensitivity are presented. The analyses demonstrated no effect of upadacitinib on QT interval and confirmed the sensitivity of the ECG assay to detect the small QT shortening effect caused by food. Lack of bias from manual ECG adjudication was also demonstrated. These analyses supported requesting a waiver for the regulatory requirement for a dedicated thorough QT study for upadacitinib.

Upadacitinib is a novel selective Janus kinase 1 inhibitor developed for treatment of rheumatoid arthritis and other autoimmune diseases. The objective of this study was to assess the pharmacokinetics and safety of a single upadacitinib dose in subjects with normal renal function and in subjects with renal impairment. A total of 24 subjects between the ages of 18 and 75 years were assigned to 1 of 4 renal function groups based on estimated glomerular filtration rate (normal, mild, moderate, severe; N = 6/group). A single 15-mg dose of upadacitinib extended-release formulation was administered under fasting conditions. Serial plasma and urine samples were assayed to evaluate the effect of renal impairment on upadacitinib exposure through regression analysis and analysis of covariance. The primary analysis was the regression analysis of upadacitinib exposures versus estimated glomerular filtration rate. The point estimates for upadacitinib plasma exposure ratios (90% confidence interval [CI]) in subjects with mild, moderate, and severe renal impairment were 1.18 (90%CI, 1.06-1.32), 1.33 (90%CI, 1.11-1.59), and 1.44 (90%CI, 1.14-1.82) for area under the plasma concentration-time curve and 1.06 (90%CI, 0.92-1.23), 1.11 (90%CI, 0.88-1.40), and 1.14 (90%CI, 0.84-1.56) for maximum observed plasma concentration, respectively, relative to subjects with normal renal function based on the regression analysis. The analysis of covariance categorical analysis provided consistent results. Upadacitinib was well tolerated by all subjects, and no safety issues were identified in subjects with renal impairment. Renal impairment has a limited effect on upadacitinib pharmacokinetics. This is in agreement with the known limited role of urinary excretion in upadacitinib elimination. Based on the limited impact on exposure, no dose adjustment is necessary for upadacitinib in subjects with impaired renal function.

Phase 2 studies with upadacitinib, a selective Janus kinase 1 (JAK1) inhibitor, have shown safety and efficacy in the treatment of patients with active rheumatoid arthritis. We did this study to further assess the safety and efficacy of upadacitinib in patients with an inadequate response to biologic disease-modifying anti-rheumatic drugs (bDMARDs). We did this double-blind, randomised controlled phase 3 trial at 153 sites in 26 countries. Patients were aged 18 years or older, had active rheumatoid arthritis and previous inadequate response or intolerance to bDMARDs, and were receiving concomitant background conventional synthetic DMARDS (csDMARDs). We randomly assigned patients (2:2:1:1) by interactive response technology to receive once-daily oral extended-release upadacitinib 15 mg or 30 mg or placebo for 12 weeks, followed by upadacitinib 15 mg or 30 mg from week 12 onwards. The two separate primary endpoints were the proportions of patients achieving a 20% improvement in American College of Rheumatology criteria (ACR20) at week 12 and the proportion of patients achieving a 28-joint disease activity score using C-reactive protein (DAS28[CRP]) of 3·2 or less at week 12. Efficacy and safety analyses were done in the modified intention-to-treat population of all patients who received at least one dose of study drug. Data are presented up to week 24 of this ongoing study. The trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov (NCT02706847). Between March 15, 2016, and Jan 10, 2017, 499 patients were randomly assigned (n=165 upadacitinib 15 mg; n=165 upadacitinib 30 mg; n=85 placebo then upadacitinib 15 mg; and n=84 placebo then upadacitinib 30 mg) and one patient was withdrawn from the 15 mg upadacitinib group before the start of study treatment. Mean disease duration was 13·2 years (SD 9·5); 235 (47%) of 498 patients had received one previous bDMARD, 137 (28%) had received two, and 125 (25%) had received at least three; 451 (91%) patients completed treatment up to week 12 and 419 (84%) patients completed treatment up to week 24. At week 12, ACR20 was achieved by 106 (65%; 95% CI 57-72) of 164 patients receiving upadacitinib 15 mg and 93 (56%; 49-64) of 165 patients receiving upadacitinib 30 mg compared with 48 (28%; 22-35) of 169 patients receiving placebo (p<0·0001 for each dose vs placebo). DAS28(CRP) of 3·2 or less was achieved by 71 (43%; 95% CI 36-51) of 164 patients receiving upadacitinib 15 mg and 70 (42%; 35-50) of 165 patients receiving upadacitinib 30 mg versus 24 (14%; 9-20) of 169 patients receiving placebo (p<0·0001 for each dose vs placebo). Up to week 12, overall numbers of patients with adverse events were similar for the placebo group (95 [56%] of 169) and the upadacitinib 15 mg group (91 [55%] of 164), but higher in the upadacitinib 30 mg group (111 [67%] of 165). At week 12, the most common adverse events occurring in at least 5% of patients in any treatment group were upper respiratory tract infection (13 [8%] of 169 in the placebo group; 13 [8%] of 164 in the upadacitinib 15 mg group; ten [6%] of 165 in the upadacitinib 30 mg group), nasopharyngitis (11 [7%]; seven [4%]; nine [5%]), urinary tract infection (ten [6%]; 15 [9%]; nine [5%]), and worsening of rheumatoid arthritis (ten [6%]; four [2%]; six [4%]). The number of patients with serious adverse events was higher in the upadacitinib 30 mg group (12 [7%]) than in the upadacitinib 15 mg group (eight [5%]); no serious adverse events were reported in patients receiving placebo. More patients in the upadacitinib 30 mg group had serious infections, herpes zoster, and adverse events leading to discontinuation than in the upadacitinib 15 mg and placebo groups. During the placebo-controlled phase of the study, one case of pulmonary embolism, three malignancies, one major adverse cardiovascular event, and one death were reported in patients receiving upadacitinib; none were reported in patients receiving placebo. Both doses of upadacitinib led to rapid and significant improvements compared with placebo over 12 weeks in patients with refractory rheumatoid arthritis. AbbVie Inc.

Upadacitinib (ABT-494) is a selective Janus kinase 1 inhibitor being developed for treatment of auto-immune inflammatory disorders. This work evaluated effects of high-fat meal, cytochrome P450 (CYP) 3A inhibition, CYP induction, and organic anion transporting polypeptide (OATP) 1B inhibition on upadacitinib pharmacokinetics. Two Phase 1 evaluations were conducted, each in 12 healthy subjects. In Study 1, using a randomized, two-sequence crossover design, a 3 mg dose of upadacitinib (immediate-release capsules) was administered alone under fasting conditions, after high-fat meal, or on Day 4 of a 6-day regimen of 400 mg once-daily ketoconazole. In Study 2, a 12 mg upadacitinib dose was administered alone, with the first, and with the eighth dose of a 9-day regimen of rifampin 600 mg once daily. Upadacitinib plasma concentrations were characterized. Administration of upadacitinib immediate-release capsules after a high-fat meal decreased upadacitinib C<sub>max</sub> by 23% and had no impact on upadacitinib AUC relative to the fasting conditions. Ketoconazole (strong CYP3A inhibitor) increased upadacitinib C<sub>max</sub> and AUC by 70% and 75%, respectively. Multiple doses of rifampin (broad CYP inducer) decreased upadacitinib C<sub>max</sub> and AUC by approximately 50% and 60%, respectively. A single dose of rifampin (also an OATP1B inhibitor) had no effect on upadacitinib AUC. Upadacitinib was well tolerated when co-administered with ketoconazole, rifampin, or after a high-fat meal. Strong CYP3A inhibition and broad CYP induction result in a weak and moderate effect, respectively, on upadacitinib exposures. OATP1B inhibition and administration of upadacitinib immediate-release formulation with food does not impact upadacitinib exposure.

The past decade has witnessed an explosion in trial data on JAK inhibitors (JAKi). These small molecules target the Janus kinase - signal transducer and activator of transcription (JAK-STAT) pathway, blocking crucial cytokines across a septum of rheumatic diseases. As a class, JAKi are beginning to demonstrate efficacy on par, if not superior to biologics. Two first generation JAKi are licensed for use in inflammatory arthritis; tofacitinib and baricitinib. Next-generation JAKi have been designed with selective affinity for one JAK enzymes, the aim to reduce unwanted adverse effects without declining clinical efficacy. Emerging data with selective JAK1 inhibitors upadacitinib and filgotinib looks very promising. Despite differences in selectivity between JAKi, an overlap exists in their safety profiles. Across the class, a characteristic safety signal is emerging with viral opportunistic infections, particularly herpes zoster. Post marketing drug surveillance will be essential in evaluating the long-term risk with these agents.

Adult T-cell leukemia (ATL) is an aggressive T-cell lymphoproliferative malignancy of regulatory T lymphocytes (Tregs), caused by human T-cell lymphotropic virus 1 (HTLV-1). Interleukin 2 receptor alpha (IL-2Rα) is expressed in the leukemic cells of smoldering/chronic ATL patients, leading to constitutive activation of the JAK/STAT pathway and spontaneous proliferation. The PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathway also plays a critical role in ATL cell survival and proliferation. We previously performed a high-throughput screen that demonstrated additive/synergistic activity of Ruxolitinib, a JAK1/2 inhibitor, with AZD8055, an mTORC1/C2 inhibitor. However, effects of unintended JAK2 inhibition with Ruxolitinib limits it therapeutic potential for ATL patients, which lead us to evaluate a JAK1-specific inhibitor. Here, we demonstrated that Upadacitinib, a JAK-1 inhibitor, inhibited the proliferation of cytokine-dependent ATL cell lines and the expression of p-STAT5. Combinations of Upadacitinib with either AZD8055 or Sapanisertib, mTORC1/C2 inhibitors, showed anti-proliferative effects against cytokine-dependent ATL cell lines and synergistic effect with reducing tumor growth in NSG mice bearing IL-2 transgenic tumors. Importantly, the combination of these two agents inhibited ex vivo spontaneous proliferation of ATL cells from patients with smoldering/chronic ATL. Combined targeting of JAK/STAT and PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathways represents a promising therapeutic intervention for patients with smoldering/chronic ATL.

We assessed the relative efficacy and safety of once-daily administration of 15 and 30 mg upadacitinib (a JAK1-selective inhibitor) in patients with active rheumatoid arthritis (RA). We conducted a Bayesian network meta-analysis to combine the direct and indirect evidence from randomized controlled trials (RCTs) that examined the efficacy and safety of upadacitinib in patients with active RA. Five RCTs involving 4381 patients met the inclusion criteria. There were 15 pairwise comparisons, including eight direct comparisons and six interventions. The ACR20 response rate was significantly higher in the upadacitinib 15 and 30 mg + MTX (methotrexate) groups than in the MTX group (OR: 4.98, 95% CrI: 2.66-10.10; OR: 4.73, 95% CrI: 2.25-10.98). Adalimumab 40 mg + MTX, upadacitinib 30 mg, and upadacitinib 15 mg groups showed a significantly higher ACR20 response rate than did the MTX group. Ranking probability based on the surface under the cumulative ranking curve (SUCRA) indicated that upadacitinib 15 mg + MTX was likely to achieve the best ACR20 response rate (SUCRA = 0.838), followed by upadacitinib 30 mg + MTX, adalimumab 40 mg + MTX, upadacitinib 30 mg, upadacitinib 15 mg, and MTX (SUCRA = 0.784, 0.495, 0.471, 0.404, and 0.008, respectively). The safety based on the number of serious adverse events (SAEs) did not differ significantly among the six interventions. Upadacitinib 15 and 30 mg administration once daily in combination with MTX was the most efficacious intervention for active RA, with no significant risk for SAEs.

Orally bioavailable inhibitors of the tyrosine kinases (TYKs), also referred to as Janus kinases (JAKs), are being evaluated for the treatment of patients with Crohn's disease (CD), ulcerative colitis (UC), and other chronic inflammatory disorders. To date, three JAK inhibitors have been tested in patients with moderate-to-severe CD: tofacitinib (pan-JAK inhibitor), filgotinib (JAK1 inhibitor) and upadacitinib (JAK1 inhibitor). Clinical development of tofacitinib was discontinued in CD because the primary endpoint of clinical remission in the phase II induction and maintenance trials was not met, although outcomes may have been influenced by trial design flaws and a high placebo rate was noted. In contrast, filgotinib did meet its primary endpoint of clinical remission at week 10 in the phase II FITZROY trial, in addition to several other clinically important secondary outcomes, spurring a subsequent larger phase III trial. Following promising results for upadacitinib in its phase II trial, larger phase III trials were also initiated to corroborate the efficacy results. Although JAK inhibitors appear to have an acceptable safety profile, higher rates of infections compared to placebo were noted. Overall, JAK inhibitors constitute a new promising class of drugs, given the efficacy signals observed in pivotal clinical trials in several chronic inflammatory diseases. Here we review the existing evidence on the pharmacology, safety and efficacy of JAK-STAT inhibitors that are currently under investigation for the treatment of patients with CD.

<b>Introduction</b>: Tofacitinib and baricitinib have recently been approved as second-line treatments for Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) though their maximum expected efficacy may be limited by dose-related toxicities. Upadacitinib selectively inhibits Janus Kinase 1 (JAK1) which could potentially reduce JAK2 and JAK3-related side effects. <b>Areas covered</b>: In this paper, we review a newly developed oral selective JAK inhibitor, upadacitinib for the treatment of RA. The doses of upadacitinib extended-release 15 and 30 mg daily selected in phase III RA studies have shown a near-maximum efficacy in phase II studies. Upadacitinib inhibited radiographic progression and displayed rapid and sustained clinical and functional efficacy in RA when in combination with methotrexate (MTX), upadacitinib was superior to placebo in MTX-Inadequate Responders (IRs) and biologic disease modifying antirheumatic drugs-IRs while as monotherapy, it was superior to MTX in MTX-IRs and MTX-naïve patients. Upadacitinib was superior to adalimumab using ACR70, reduction of pain-VAS and improvement of HAQ-DI. The comparison with abatacept is still ongoing. <b>Expert commentary</b>: Upadacitinib has displayed a rapid and favorable efficacy profile in RA but despite being a selective JAK1 inhibitor appears to have a similar safety profile to less-selective Jakinibs. Longer term safety data are awaited.

There is a great unmet clinical need for efficacious, tolerable, economical and orally administrated drugs for the treatment of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). New therapeutic avenues have become possible including the development of medications that target specific genetic pathways found to be relevant in other immune mediated diseases. To provide an overview of recent clinical trials for new generation oral targeted medications that may have a future role in IBD management. Pubmed and Medline searches were performed up to 1 March 2018 using keywords: "IBD", "UC", "CD", "inflammatory bowel disease" "ulcerative colitis", "Crohn's disease" in combination with "phase", "study", "trial" and "oral". A manual search of the clinical trial register, article reference lists, abstracts from meetings of Digestive Disease Week, United European Gastroenterology Week and ECCO congress were also conducted. In randomised controlled trials primary efficacy endpoints were met for tofacitinib (JAK 1/3 inhibitor-phase III), upadacitinib (JAK 1 inhibitor-phase II) and AJM300 (α4-integrin antagonist-phase II) in ulcerative colitis. Ozanimod (S1P receptor agonist-phase II) also demonstrated clinical remission. For Crohn's disease, filgotinib (JAK1 inhibitor-phase II) met primary endpoints and laquinimod (quinolone-3-carboxide small molecule-phase II) was also efficacious. Trials using mongersen (SMAD7 inhibitor) and vidofludimus (dihydroorotate dehydrogenase inhibitor) have been halted. This is potentially the start of an exciting new era in which multiple therapeutic options are at the disposal of physicians to treat IBD on an individualised basis. Head-to-head studies with existing treatments and longer term safety data are needed for this to be possible.

Upadacitinib is a selective inhibitor of Janus kinase 1 and was efficacious in phase 2 studies in patients with moderate-to-severe rheumatoid arthritis. We aimed to assess the efficacy of upadacitinib in patients with inadequate response to conventional synthetic disease-modifying anti-rheumatic drugs (csDMARDs). This study is a double-blind, placebo-controlled trial at 150 sites in 35 countries. We enrolled patients aged 18 years or older with active rheumatoid arthritis for 3 months or longer, who had received csDMARDs for at least 3 months with a stable dose for at least 4 weeks before study entry, and had an inadequate response to at least one of the following csDMARDs: methotrexate, sulfasalazine, or leflunomide. Using interactive response technology, we randomly assigned patients receiving stable background csDMARDs (2:2:1:1) to receive a once-daily extended-release formulation of upadacitinib 15 mg or 30 mg, or placebo, for 12 weeks. Patients, investigators, and the funder were masked to allocation. After 12 weeks, patients taking placebo received 15 mg or 30 mg of upadacitinib once daily, according to the prespecified randomisation assignment. The primary endpoints were the proportion of patients at week 12 who achieved 20% improvement in American College of Rheumatology criteria (ACR20), and a 28-joint disease activity score using C-reactive protein (DAS28[CRP]) of 3·2 or less. We did efficacy analyses in the full analysis set of all randomly assigned patients who received at least one dose of study drug, and used non-responder imputation for assessment of the primary outcomes. This study is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT02675426. Between Dec 17, 2015, and Dec 22, 2016, 1083 patients were assessed for eligibility, of whom 661 were recruited and randomly assigned to receive upadacitinib 15 mg (n=221), upadacitinib 30 mg (n=219), or placebo (n=221). All patients received at least one dose of study drug, and 618 (93%) completed 12 weeks of treatment. At week 12, ACR20 was achieved by 141 (64%; 95% CI 58-70) of 221 patients receiving upadacitinib 15 mg and 145 (66%; 60-73) of 219 patients receiving upadacitinib 30 mg, compared with 79 (36%; 29-42) of 221 patients receiving placebo (p<0·0001 for each dose vs placebo). DAS28(CRP) of 3·2 or less was met by 107 (48%; 95% CI 42-55) patients receiving upadacitinib 15 mg and 105 (48%; 41-55) patients receiving upadacitinib 30 mg, compared with 38 (17%; 12-22) patients receiving placebo (p<0·0001 for each dose vs placebo). Adverse events were reported in 125 (57%) of 221 patients receiving upadacitinib 15 mg, 118 (54%) of 219 patients receiving upadacitinib 30 mg, and 108 (49%) of 221 patients receiving placebo. The most frequently reported adverse events (≥5% of patients in any group) were nausea (16 [7%] of 221 in the upadacitinib 15 mg group; three [1%] of 219 in the upadacitinib 30 mg group; and seven [3%] of 221 in the placebo group), nasopharyngitis (12 [5%]; 13 [6%]; and nine [4%]), upper respiratory tract infection (12 [5%]; 12 [5%]; and nine [4%]), and headache (nine [4%]; seven [3%]; and 12 [5%]). More infections were reported for upadacitinib (64 [29%] of 221 patients receiving 15 mg and 69 [32%] of 219 patients receiving 30 mg) versus placebo (47 [21%] of 221 patients). There were three herpes zoster infections (one [<1%] in the placebo group, one [<1%] in the upadacitinib 15 mg group, and one [<1%] in the upadacitinib 30 mg group) and one primary varicella zoster virus infection (one [<1%] in the upadacitinib 30 mg group), two malignancies (both in the upadacitinib 30 mg group), one adjudicated major adverse cardiovascular event (in the upadacitinib 30 mg group), and five serious infections (one [<1%] in the placebo group, one [<1%] in the upadacitinib 15 mg group, three [1%] in the upadacitinib 30 mg group). No deaths were reported during the trial. Patients with moderately to severely active rheumatoid arthritis who received upadacitinib (15 mg or 30 mg) in combination with csDMARDs showed significant improvements in clinical signs and symptoms.

Upadacitinib is a janus kinase (JAK) 1 inhibitor being developed for the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis (RA) and other inflammatory diseases. This work characterized upadacitinib population pharmacokinetics in healthy subjects and RA patients and the effects of covariates on upadacitinib exposure. Upadacitinib plasma concentrations (n = 6399) from 107 healthy subjects and 466 RA patients from three phase I and two 12-week RA phase IIb trials (1-48 mg immediate-release doses across studies) were analyzed using non-linear mixed-effects modeling. The models were qualified using bootstrap and stochastic simulations. A two-compartment model with first-order absorption and elimination described upadacitinib pharmacokinetics. Estimates (95% bootstrap confidence interval) for upadacitinib oral clearance, steady-state volume of distribution, absorption lag time, and mean absorption time were 39.7 (37.8-41.5) L/h, 210 (196-231) L, 0.48 (0.47-0.49) h, and 0.08 (0.04-0.12) h, respectively, for a typical healthy male. Matching on other covariates, a 16 and 32% higher upadacitinib area under the concentration-time curve (AUC) was estimated for females relative to males, and for subjects with RA relative to healthy volunteers, respectively. Subjects with RA with mild or moderate renal impairment were estimated to have 16 and 32% higher upadacitinib AUC, respectively, compared with subjects with RA with normal renal function. Upadacitinib clearance was not correlated with body weight. Upadacitinib pharmacokinetics follow dose-proportional, bi-exponential disposition. A slightly lower upadacitinib clearance is estimated in subjects with RA than in healthy volunteers, consistent with observations for other JAK inhibitors. Other covariates (weight, sex, mild or moderate renal impairment) are not associated with clinically relevant effects on upadacitinib exposure.

Anti-cytokine therapies such as adalimumab, tocilizumab, and the small molecule JAK inhibitor tofacitinib have proven that cytokines and their subsequent downstream signaling processes are important in the pathogenesis of rheumatoid arthritis. Tofacitinib, a pan-JAK inhibitor, is the first approved JAK inhibitor for the treatment of RA and has been shown to be effective in managing disease. However, in phase 2 dose-ranging studies tofacitinib was associated with dose-limiting tolerability and safety issues such as anemia. Upadacitinib (ABT-494) is a selective JAK1 inhibitor that was engineered to address the hypothesis that greater JAK1 selectivity over other JAK family members will translate into a more favorable benefit:risk profile. Upadacitinib selectively targets JAK1 dependent disease drivers such as IL-6 and IFNγ, while reducing effects on reticulocytes and natural killer (NK) cells, which potentially contributed to the tolerability issues of tofacitinib. Structure-based hypotheses were used to design the JAK1 selective inhibitor upadacitinib. JAK family selectivity was defined with in vitro assays including biochemical assessments, engineered cell lines, and cytokine stimulation. In vivo selectivity was defined by the efficacy of upadacitinib and tofacitinib in a rat adjuvant induced arthritis model, activity on reticulocyte deployment, and effect on circulating NK cells. The translation of the preclinical JAK1 selectivity was assessed in healthy volunteers using ex vivo stimulation with JAK-dependent cytokines. Here, we show the structural basis for the JAK1 selectivity of upadacitinib, along with the in vitro JAK family selectivity profile and subsequent in vivo physiological consequences. Upadacitinib is ~ 60 fold selective for JAK1 over JAK2, and > 100 fold selective over JAK3 in cellular assays. While both upadacitinib and tofacitinib demonstrated efficacy in a rat model of arthritis, the increased selectivity of upadacitinib for JAK1 resulted in a reduced effect on reticulocyte deployment and NK cell depletion relative to efficacy. Ex vivo pharmacodynamic data obtained from Phase I healthy volunteers confirmed the JAK1 selectivity of upadactinib in a clinical setting. The data presented here highlight the JAK1 selectivity of upadacinitinib and supports its use as an effective therapy for the treatment of RA with the potential for an improved benefit:risk profile.

The past three decades have witnessed remarkable advances in our ability to target specific elements of the immune and inflammatory response, fuelled by advances in both biotechnology and disease knowledge. As well as providing superior treatments for immune-mediated inflammatory diseases (IMIDs), such therapies also offer unrivalled opportunities to study the underlying immunopathological basis of these conditions.In this review, we explore recent approaches to the treatment of IMIDs and the insights to pathobiology that they provide. We review novel biologic agents targeting the T-helper 17 axis, including therapies directed towards interleukin (IL)-17 (secukinumab, ixekizumab, bimekizumab), IL-17R (brodalumab), IL-12/23p40 (ustekinumab, briakinumab) and IL-23p19 (guselkumab, tildrakizumab, brazikumab, risankizumab, mirikizumab). We also present an overview of biologics active against type I and II interferons, including sifalumumab, rontalizumab, anifrolumab and fontolizumab. Emerging strategies to interfere with cellular adhesion processes involved in lymphocyte recruitment are discussed, including both integrin blockade (natalizumab, vedolizumab, etrolizumab) and sphingosine-1-phosphate receptor inhibition (fingolimod, ozanimod). We summarise the development and recent application of Janus kinase (JAK) inhibitors in the treatment of IMIDs, including first-generation pan-JAK inhibitors (tofacitinib, baricitinib, ruxolitinib, peficitinib) and second-generation selective JAK inhibitors (decernotinib, filgotinib, upadacitinib). New biologics targeting B-cells (including ocrelizumab, veltuzumab, tabalumab and atacicept) and the development of novel strategies for regulatory T-cell modulation (including low-dose IL-2 therapy and Tregitopes) are also discussed. Finally, we explore recent biotechnological advances such as the development of bispecific antibodies (ABT-122, COVA322), and their application to the treatment of IMIDs.

Upadacitinib is a novel selective oral Janus kinase 1 (JAK) inhibitor being developed for treatment of several inflammatory diseases. Oral contraceptives are anticipated to be a common concomitant medication in the target patient populations. This study was designed to evaluate the effect of multiple doses of upadacitinib on the pharmacokinetics of ethinylestradiol and levonorgestrel in healthy female subjects. This phase I, single-center, open-label, 2-period crossover study evaluated the effect of multiple doses of 30 mg once daily extended-release upadacitinib on the pharmacokinetics of a single oral dose of ethinylestradiol/levonorgestrel (0.03/0.15 mg; administered alone in period 1 and on day 12 of a 14-day regimen of upadacitinib in period 2) in 22 healthy female subjects. The ratios (90% confidence intervals) for maximum plasma concentration and area under the plasma drug concentration-time curve from time zero to infinity following administration of ethinylestradiol/levonorgestrel with upadacitinib compared with administration of ethinylestradiol/ levonorgestrel alone were 0.96 (0.89-1.02) and 1.1 (1.04-1.19), respectively, for ethinylestradiol, and 0.96 (0.87-1.06) and 0.96 (0.85-1.07), respectively, for levonorgestrel. The harmonic mean terminal half-life for ethinylestradiol (7.7 vs 7.0 hours) and levonorgestrel (37.1 vs 33.1 hours) was similar in the presence and absence of upadacitinib. Ethinylestradiol and levonorgestrel were bioequivalent in the presence and absence of upadacitinib. Therefore, upadacitinib can be administered concomitantly with oral contraceptives containing ethinylestradiol or levonorgestrel.

Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is a chronic inflammatory disease primarily affecting the joints and is associated with significant levels of disability and reduced quality of life. Janus kinase (JAK) inhibitors are a relatively new class of small molecule oral treatments and offer an alternative for patients with RA who do not respond to conventional or biologic therapy. Upadacitinib is a JAK inhibitor engineered to be selective for JAK1, and has recently been approved for use in patients with moderate-to-severe RA. The purpose of this article is to provide a comprehensive review of upadacitinib, including preclinical development and characterization, phase I and II studies, and the phase III SELECT program. Ongoing trials of upadacitinib in additional indications, including spondyloarthritis, inflammatory bowel disease, and atopic dermatitis, are also discussed.
