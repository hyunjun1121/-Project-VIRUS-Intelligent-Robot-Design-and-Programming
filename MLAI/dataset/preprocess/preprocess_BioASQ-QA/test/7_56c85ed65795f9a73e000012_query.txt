Does dasatinib promote or inhibit T-cell proliferation?

[PMID: 19066329]
Dasatinib, a dual tyrosine kinase inhibitor, is known to modulate or suppress T-cell activation and proliferation. We report a series of 8 patients who developed chronic peripheral lymphocytosis, identified as natural killer cells or natural killer/T-cells based on their large granular lymphocyte morphologies and CD16(+), CD56(+), CD3(-) or CD3(+) immunophenotypic profiles, out of 18 patients receiving dasatinib therapy. All cases that developed large granular lymphocyte lymphocytosis achieved optimal molecular response (8/8 in large granular lymphocyte(+) patients vs. 3/10 in large granular lymphocyte(-) patients, p=0.002). A (51)Cr release assay demonstrated that natural killer cell cytotoxicity has been enhanced in a case of large granular lymphocyte lymphocytosis compared to normal healthy donors, and that natural killer cell cytotoxicity in dasatinib-responders was superior to that in non-responders. In summary, the present study suggests that natural killer or natural killer/T cell lineage large granular lymphocyte lymphocytosis develops in association with dasatinib therapy and that large granular lymphocyte might have a therapeutic effect on Ph(+) leukemic cells.

Dasatinib (BMS-354825) is a Src/ABL tyrosine kinase inhibitor currently approved for the treatment of chronic myeloid leukemia. Dasatinib has increased potency against ABL compared to the current therapy imatinib, and is effective in many cases where disease is resistant to imatinib. Dasatinib also inhibits many Src-family tyrosine kinases. We have demonstrated in this study that dasatinib is able to block the function of normal human T-lymphocytes in vitro at clinically relevant concentrations. T-cell functions including proliferation, activation and cytokine production were all uniformly inhibited in the presence of dasatinib. We also demonstrated inhibition of TCR signalling through Src-family kinase LCK, and predicted that inhibition of LCK and other kinases involved in T-cell signalling by dasatinib is responsible for the suppression of T-cell function. These findings raise the concern about potential T-cell inhibition in patients taking dasatinib, and suggest a possible application for the treatment of T-cell mediated immune disorders.

Dasatinib is an oral small molecule inhibitor of Abl and Src family tyrosine kinases (SFK), including p56(Lck) (Lck). Given the central importance of Lck in transmitting signals from the T-cell receptor (TCR) signaling complex and the potent ability of dasatinib to inhibit Lck activity, we hypothesized this agent could provide a novel route of immunomodulation via targeted inhibition of antigen-induced signaling. Herein, we show that dasatinib inhibits TCR-mediated signal transduction, cellular proliferation, cytokine production, and in vivo T-cell responses. However, dasatinib-mediated inhibition does not induce apoptosis because the effect is reversible or may be overcome by signals bypassing the TCR, such as phorbol ester. Signal transduction and proliferative responses via IL-2 remain essentially unperturbed, suggesting that dasatinib displays specificity for TCR signaling. In addition, dasatinib combined with cyclosporine A or rapamycin led to a much more potent inhibition of T-cell activation, suggesting that targeted inhibition of Lck could be a useful adjunct for enhanced immunomodulation. In combination with currently available immunomodulatory agents, SFK inhibition could potentially increase immunomodulatory efficacy while minimizing toxicity of individual agents.

Dasatinib (BMS-354825) is a small molecule Src/Abl tyrosine kinase inhibitor approved for the treatment of chronic myeloid leukemia and Philadelphia chromosome-positive acute lymphoblastic leukemia. Members of the Src family of kinases are involved in the induction of innate and adaptive immunity. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the inhibitory action of dasatinib on antigen-specific CD8(+) and CD4(+) T-cell function, as well as natural killer (NK) cell cytotoxicity. To assess dasatinib-mediated inhibition of antigen-specific T-cell proliferation, transgenic CD4(+) and CD8(+) T cells specific for ovalbumin were utilized. Endogenous CD4(+) and CD8(+) T-cell responses were determined following immunization of dasatinib-treated or control mice with a nonreplicating recombinant virus. Clearance of the RMA-S cells, a major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class I-deficient thymoma sensitive to NK-cell lysis, was analyzed in mice undergoing dasatinib treatment. Dasatinib inhibited antigen-specific proliferation of murine CD4(+) and CD8(+) transgenic T cells in vitro and in vivo. Endogenous antigen-specific helper T-cell recall responses and induction of T-cell-mediated cytotoxicity following immunization with a nonreplicating recombinant virus were also inhibited. So to was the ability of NK cells to eliminate MHC class I-deficient cells in vivo. These findings suggest that dasatinib has the potential to modulate the host immune response at clinical doses and highlights scope for off target applications, e.g., therapeutic immunosuppression in the context of autoimmune pathogenesis and allogeneic tissue transplantation.

To investigate the inhibitory effects of dasatinib on proliferation, function, and signaling events on CD8+T cells. Carboxyfluorescein diacetate succinimidyl ester and 5-bromo-2-deoxyuridine were used to detect proliferation and cell cycle of CD8+T cells treated with dasatinib, respectively. Frequency and function of viral and leukemia-antigen-specific CD8+T cells from healthy donors were measured by tetramer staining and ELISPOT assay. Western blotting analysis was performed to detect T-cell receptor (TCR), nuclear factor kappa B (NF-kappaB) and Src signaling events in T cells treated with dasatinib or imatinib. Dasatinib inhibited proliferation of CD8+T cells in a dose-dependent manner, which was associated with lower secretion of interferon-gamma and granzyme B, as well as with arrest of CD8+T cells in the G0/G1 phase of cell cycle. Inhibition of CD8+T cells was proven for blood samples from a patient under dasatinib medication when compared with their T-cell status without dasatinib. Western blotting confirmed that these effects were mediated through downregulation of the phosphorylation level of molecules from the TCR and the NF-kappaB signaling transduction cascade. Dasatinib proved to be more potent than imatinib on Src and TCR signaling events in Jurkat T cells. Our study demonstrated that dasatinib impaired proliferation and function of CD8+T cells via TCR and NF-kappaB signaling events without inducing apoptosis. Therefore, dasatinib might alter the graft-vs-leukemia effect and the graft-vs-host disease after allogeneic stem cell transplantation sustained by CD8+T cells. Dasatinib might also be used as a novel immunosuppressant agent.

CD4+CD25+ regulatory T cells (Tregs) can influence various immune responses. Little is known about the effects of the Abl/Src kinase inhibitor dasatinib on Tregs which regulate anti-tumor/leukaemia immune responses. The present study demonstrated that dasatinib inhibited proliferation of Tregs and CD4+CD25- T cells in a dose-dependent manner, which was associated with the decreased production of corresponding cytokines. Treatment of Tregs with dasatinib inhibited the suppressive capacity of Tregs. The mechanisms of this inhibition included arrest of cells in the G0/G1 phase of cell cycle, down-regulation of the transcription factor forkhead box P3, glucocorticoid-induced tumour necrosis factor receptor and the cytotoxic T lymphocyte associated protein 4 as well as inhibition of signaling events through Src and nuclear factor kappaB. Dasatinib showed an inhibitory effect on the proliferation and function of both Tregs and CD4+CD25- T cells at therapeutically relevant concentrations of the drug. Clinical administration of dasatinib might influence not only the graft-versus-leukaemia effect but also the graft-versus-host-disease in patients receiving dasatinib after allogeneic stem cell transplantation and/or donor lymphocytes infusion as the function of both Tregs and effector T cells are hampered in a similar way by dasatinib.

The dual BCR-ABL/SRC kinase inhibitor dasatinib entered the clinic for the treatment of chronic myeloid leukemia and Ph+ acute lymphoblastic leukemia. Because SRC kinases are known to play an important role in physiologic T-cell activation, we analyzed the immunobiological effects of dasatinib on T-cell function. The effect of dasatinib on multiple T-cell effector functions was examined at clinically relevant doses (1-100 nmol/L); the promiscuous tyrosine kinase inhibitor staurosporine was used as a comparator. Purified human CD3+ cells and virus-specific CD8+ T cells from healthy blood donors were studied directly ex vivo; antigen-specific effects were confirmed in defined T-cell clones. Functional outcomes included cytokine production (interleukin-2, IFN gamma, and tumor necrosis factor alpha), degranulation (CD107a/b mobilization), activation (CD69 up-regulation), proliferation (carboxyfluorescein diacetate succinimidyl ester dilution), apoptosis/necrosis induction, and signal transduction. Both dasatinib and staurosporine inhibited T-cell activation, proliferation, cytokine production, and degranulation in a dose-dependent manner. Mechanistically, this was mediated by the blockade of early signal transduction events and was not due to loss of T-cell viability. Overall, CD4+ T cells seemed to be more sensitive to these effects than CD8+ T cells, and na√Øve T cells more sensitive than memory T-cell subsets. The inhibitory effects of dasatinib were so profound that all T-cell effector functions were shut down at therapeutically relevant concentrations. These findings indicate that caution is warranted with use of this drug in the clinical setting and provide a rationale to explore the potential of dasatinib as an immunosuppressant in the fields of transplantation and T-cell-driven autoimmune diseases.
