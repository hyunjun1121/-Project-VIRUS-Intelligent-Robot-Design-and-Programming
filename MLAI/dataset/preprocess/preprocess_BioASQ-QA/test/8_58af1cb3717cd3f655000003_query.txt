Which is the main abnormality that arises with Sox9 locus duplication?

[PMID: 10588843]
SOX9 is one of the genes that play critical roles in male sexual differentiation. Mutations of SOX9 leading to haploinsufficiency can cause campomelic dysplasia and XY sex reversal. We report here evidence supporting that SOX9 duplication can cause XX sex reversal. A newborn infant was referred for genetic evaluation because of abnormal male external genitalia. The infant had severe penile/scrotal hypospadias. Gonads were palpable. Cytogenetic analysis demonstrated a de novo mosaic 46,XX,dup(17)(q23.1q24.3)/46, XX karyotype. Fluorescent in situ hybridization (FISH) with a BAC clone containing the SOX9 gene demonstrated that the SOX9 gene is duplicated on the rearranged chromosome 17. The presence of SRY was ruled out by FISH with a probe containing the SRY gene and polymerase chain reaction with SRY-specific primers. Microsatellite analysis with 13 markers on 17q23-24 determined that the duplication is maternal in origin and defined the boundary of the duplication to be approximately 12 centimorgans (cM) proximal and 4 cM distal to the SOX9 gene. Thus, SOX9 duplication is the most likely cause for the sex reversal in this case because it plays an important role in male sex determination and differentiation. This study suggests that extra dose of SOX9 is sufficient to initiate testis differentiation in the absence of SRY. Other SRY-negative XX sex-reversed individuals deserve thorough investigation of SOX9 gene.

It is well established that testicular differentiation of the human embryonic gonad depends on the action of the Y-chromosomal gene SRY. However, exceptional cases such as SRY-negative cases of 46,XX testicular disorder of sexual development (DSD), and of 46,XX ovotesticular DSD document that testicular tissue can develop in the absence of the SRY gene. These SRY-negative XX sex reversal cases are very rare and usually sporadic, but a few familial cases have been reported. We present a large, consanguineous family with nine affected individuals with phenotypes ranging from 46,XX testicular DSD to 46,XX ovotesticular DSD, with predominance of male characteristics. Absence of SRY in peripheral blood was documented by fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) and PCR analysis in all nine affected individuals, and by FISH analysis on gonadal sections with testicular tissue in four affected individuals. By quantitative PCR, a duplication of the SOX9 gene was excluded. In addition, as linkage analysis showed that the nine affected members of the family do not share a common SOX9 haplotype, any mutation at the SOX9 locus could be ruled out. Together, these findings implicate a mutation at a sex-determining locus other than SRY and SOX9 as the cause for the XX sex reversal trait in this family.

Differentiation of the bipotential gonad into testis is initiated by the Y chromosome-linked gene SRY (Sex-determining Region Y) through upregulation of its autosomal direct target gene SOX9 (Sry-related HMG box-containing gene 9). Sequence and chromosome homology studies have shown that SRY most probably evolved from SOX3, which in humans is located at Xq27.1. Mutations causing SOX3 loss-of-function do not affect the sex determination in mice or humans. However, transgenic mouse studies have shown that ectopic expression of Sox3 in the bipotential gonad results in upregulation of Sox9, resulting in testicular induction and XX male sex reversal. However, the mechanism by which these rearrangements cause sex reversal and the frequency with which they are associated with disorders of sex development remains unclear. Rearrangements of the SOX3 locus were identified recently in three cases of human XX male sex reversal. We report on a case of XX male sex reversal associated with a novel de novo duplication of the SOX3 gene. These data provide additional evidence that SOX3 gain-of-function in the XX bipotential gonad causes XX male sex reversal and further support the hypothesis that SOX3 is the evolutionary antecedent of SRY.

Sexual development in mammals is based on a complicated and delicate network of genes and hormones that have to collaborate in a precise manner. The dark side of this pathway is represented by pathological conditions, wherein sexual development does not occur properly either in the XX and the XY background. Among them a conundrum is represented by the XX individuals with at least a partial testis differentiation even in absence of SRY. This particular condition is present in various mammals including the dog. Seven dogs characterized by XX karyotype, absence of SRY gene, and testicular tissue development were analysed by Array-CGH. In two cases the array-CGH analysis detected an interstitial heterozygous duplication of chromosome 9. The duplication contained the SOX9 coding region. In this work we provide for the first time a causative mutation for the XXSR condition in the dog. Moreover this report supports the idea that the dog represents a good animal model for the study of XXSR condition caused by abnormalities in the SOX9 locus.

A complex network of genes determines sex in mammals. Here, we studied a European roe deer with an intersex phenotype that was consistent with a XY genotype with incomplete male-determination. Whole genome sequencing and quantitative real-time PCR analyses revealed a triple dose of the SOX9 gene, allowing insights into a new genetic defect in a wild animal.

The 46,XX testicular disorder of sex development (DSD), also known as 46,XX male syndrome, is a rare form of DSD and clinical phenotype shows complete sex reversal from female to male. The sex-determining region Y (SRY) gene can be identified in most 46,XX testicular DSD patients; however, approximately 20% of patients with 46,XX testicular DSD are SRY-negative. The SRY-box 9 (SOX9) gene has several important functions during testis development and differentiation in males, and overexpression of SOX9 leads to the male development of 46,XX gonads in the absence of SRY. In addition, SOX9 duplication has been found to be a rare cause of 46,XX testicular DSD in humans. Here, we report a 4.2-year-old SRY-negative 46,XX boy with complete sex reversal caused by SOX9 duplication for the first time in Korea. He showed normal external and internal male genitalia except for small testes. Fluorescence in situ hybridization and polymerase chain reaction (PCR) analyses failed to detect the presence of SRY, and SOX9 intragenic mutation was not identified by direct sequencing analysis. Therefore, we performed real-time PCR analyses with specific primer pairs, and duplication of the SOX9 gene was revealed. Although SRY-negative 46,XX testicular DSD is a rare condition, an effort to make an accurate diagnosis is important for the provision of proper genetic counseling and for guiding patients in their long-term management.

In humans, testis development depends on a regulated genetic hierarchy initiated by the Y-linked SRY gene. Failure of testicular determination results in the condition termed 46,XY gonadal dysgenesis (GD). Several components of the testis determining pathway have recently been identified though it has been difficult to articulate a cascade with the known elements of the system. It seems, however, that early gonadal development is the result of a network of interactions instead of the outcome of a linear cascade. Accumulating evidence shows that testis formation in man is sensitive to gene dosage. Haploinsufficiency of SF1, WT1 and SOX9 is responsible for 46,XY gonadal dysgenesis. Besides, data on SRY is consistent with possible dosage anomalies in certain cases of male to female sex reversal. 46,XY GD due to monosomy of distal 9p and 10q might also be associated with an insufficient gene dosage effect. Duplications of the locus DSS can lead to a failure of testicular development and a duplication of the region containing SOX9 has been implicated in XX sex reversal. Transgenic studies in mouse have shown, however, that this mammal is less sensitive to gene dosage than man. Here, we will try to put in place the known pieces of the jigsaw puzzle that is sex determination in mammals, as far as current knowledge obtained from man and animal models allows. We are certain that from this attempt more questions than answers will arise.

Differentiation of testicular tissue in 46,XX individuals is seen either in XX males, the majority of them with SRY gene, or in individuals, usually SRY(-), with ovotesticular disorder of sex development (OT-DSD). Although they are sporadic cases, there are some reports on familial recurrence, including coexistence of XX maleness and OT-DSD in the same family. We report on a case of SRY(-) 46,XX monozygotic twins with genital ambiguity. Hormonal evaluation included testosterone, FSH, and LH measurements. SRY gene was investigated by PCR and two-step PCR in peripheral leukocytes and gonadal tissues, respectively. Direct DNA sequencing of the DAX-1 coding sequence was performed. Real-time PCR for SOX9 region on chromosome 17 was obtained. Both twins had a 46,XX karyotype. Twin A had a 1-cm phallus with chordee, penoscrotal hypospadias, and palpable gonads. Serum levels of FSH (2.34 mIU/ml), LH (8.8 mIU/ml), and testosterone (1.6 ng/ml) were normal, and biopsies revealed bilateral testes. Twin B had a 0.5-cm phallus, perineal hypospadias, no palpable gonad on the right, and a left inguinal hernia. Hormonal evaluation revealed high FSH (8.2 mIU/ml) and LH (15 mIU/ml) and low testosterone (0.12 ng/ml). Upon herniotomy, a right testis (crossed ectopia) and a small left ovotestis were found. SRY gene was absent in both peripheral leukocytes and gonadal tissue samples. Neither DAX-1 mutations nor SOX9 duplication was identified. This case provides evidence that both XX maleness and XX OT-DSD are different manifestations of the same disorder of gonadal development.
