Which is the gene most commonly mutated in Tay-Sachs disease?

[PMID: 2967444]
Tay-Sachs disease displays a variety of forms on the clinical and biochemical level. On the molecular level it has been shown, that poly (A)+ RNA preparations from fibroblasts of patients with classical Tay-Sachs disease lack detectable alpha-chain message when analyzed by Northern blotting with complementary DNA encoding the alpha-chain of human beta-hexosaminidase A. In this report the p beta H alpha-5 clone was used to investigate whether patients with two different variants of Tay-Sachs disease also lack the alpha-chain message. On the basis of RNA hybridization analyses, we could show that our patients which synthesize an altered alpha-chain, as judged by testing enzyme activity and substrate specificity, have the 2.1 kb mRNA which is also seen in healthy control patients.

The incidence of Tay-Sachs disease (TSD) carriers, as defined by enzyme assay, is 1:29 among Ashkenazi Jews and 1:110 among Moroccan Jews. An elevated carrier frequency of 1:140 was also observed in the Iraqi Jews (IJ), while in other Israeli populations the world's pan-ethnic frequency of approximately 1:280 has been found. Recently a novel mutation, G749T, has been reported in 38.7% of the IJ carriers (24/62). Here we report a second novel HEXA mutation specific to the IJ TDS carriers: a substitution of cytosine 1351 by guanosine (C1351G), resulting in the change of leucine to valine in position 451. This mutation was found in 33.9% (21/62) of the carriers and in none of 100 non-carrier IJ. In addition to the two specific mutations, 14.5% (9/62) of the IJ carriers bear a known "Jewish" mutation (Ashkenazi or Moroccan) and 11.3% (7/62) carry a known "non-Jewish" mutation. In 1 DNA sample no mutation has yet been detected. To investigate the genetic history of the IJ-specific mutations (C1351G and G749T), the allelic distribution of four polymorphic markers (D15S131, D15S1025, D15S981, D15S1050) was analyzed in IJ heterozygotes and ethnically matched controls. Based on linkage disequilibrium, recombination factor (theta) between the markers and mutated loci, and the population growth correction, we deduced that G749T occurred in a founder ancestor 44.8 +/- 14.2 generations (g) ago [95% confidence interval (CI) 17.0-72.6 g] and C1351G arose 80.4 +/- 35.9 g ago (95% CI 44.5-116.3 g). Thus, the estimated dates for introduction of mutations are: 626 +/- 426 A.D. (200-1052 A.D.) for G749T and 442 +/- 1077 B.C. (1519 B.C. to 635 A.D.) for C1351G.

GM2-gangliosidosis is a group of neurological disorders resulting from genetically defective catabolism, and consequent abnormal accumulation, of GM2-ganglioside. Three major types are distinguished: the B variant (Tay-Sachs disease), the O variant (Sandhoff disease), and the AB variant, caused by genetic abnormalities in the genes coding for the beta-hexosaminidase alpha- or beta-subunit, or the GM2-activator protein, respectively. A number of gene abnormalities responsible for Tay-Sachs disease have already been identified and the correlation between the beta-hexosaminidase alpha gene abnormality and the clinical phenotype has been explained in many cases. In the severest phenotype of Tay-Sachs disease (infantile form), mRNA of beta-hexosaminidase alpha subunit is not produced or is unstable such as in French Canadian patients or in Jewish patients with infantile Tay-Sachs disease, or the polypeptide does not have any catalytic activities because of the alteration of glycosylation such as the mutation of Glu482-to-Lys found in a Italian patient or the altered structure of polypeptide. The mutation identified in a large majority of the Japanese infantile Tay-Sachs disease patients, which is a G-to-T substitution at 3'-end of intron 5, generates a short mRNA with complete skipping of exon 6 and a polypeptide lacking 34 amino acids is generated but catalytically inactive. On the other hand, some active alpha beta dimers must be generated in patients with milder phenotypes of Tay-Sachs disease such as Gly269-to-Ser mutation in an adult form. Some of the mutations appear in high frequency among certain ethnic groups such as Ashkenazi Jewish patients and French Canadians.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)

Tay-Sachs disease is an autosomal recessive genetic disorder resulting from mutation of the HEXA gene encoding the alpha-subunit of the lysosomal enzyme, beta-N-acetylhexosaminidase A (ref. 1). A relatively high frequency of carriers (1/27) of a lethal, infantile form of the disease is found in the Ashkenazi Jewish population, but it is not yet evident whether this has resulted from a founder effect and random genetic drift or from a selective advantage of heterozygotes. We have identified a single-base mutation in a cloned fragment of the HEXA gene from an Ashkenazi Jewish patient. This change, the substitution of a C for G in the first nucleotide of intron 12 is expected to result in defective splicing of the messenger RNA. A test for the mutant allele based on amplification of DNA by the 'polymerase chain rection and cleavage of a DdeI restriction site generated by the mutation revealed that this case and two other cases of the Ashkenazi, infantile form of Tay-Sachs disease are heterozygous for two different mutations. The occurrence of multiple mutant alleles warrants further examination of the selective advantage hypothesis.

Tay-Sachs disease (TSD) is a recessively inherited disorder caused by the deficient activity of hexosaminidase A due to mutations in the HEXA gene. Up to date there is no information regarding the molecular genetics of TSD in Argentinean patients. In the present study we have studied 17 Argentinean families affected by TSD, including 20 patients with the acute infantile form and 3 with the sub-acute form. Overall, we identified 14 different mutations accounting for 100% of the studied alleles. Eight mutations were novel: 5 were single base changes leading to drastic residue changes or truncated proteins, 2 were small deletions and one was an intronic mutation that may cause a splicing defect. Although the spectrum of mutations was highly heterogeneous, a high frequency of the c.459+5G>A mutation, previously described in different populations was found among the studied cohort. Haplotype analysis suggested that in these families the c.459+5G>A mutation might have arisen by a single mutational event.

We have identified three mutations in the beta-hexoseaminidase A (HEXA) gene in a juvenile Tay-Sachs disease (TSD) patient, which exhibited a reduced level of HEXA mRNA. Two mutations are novel, c.814G>A (p.Gly272Arg) and c.1305C>T (p.=), located in exon 8 and in exon 11, respectively. The third mutation, c.1195A>G (p.Asn399Asp) in exon 11, has been previously characterized as a common polymorphism in African-Americans. Hex A activity measured in TSD Glial cells, transfected with HEXA cDNA constructs bearing these mutations, was unaltered from the activity level measured in normal HEXA cDNA. Analysis of RT-PCR products revealed three aberrant transcripts in the patient, one where exon 8 was absent, one where exon 11 was absent and a third lacking both exons 10 and 11. All three novel transcripts contain frameshifts resulting in premature termination codons (PTCs). Transfection of mini-gene constructs carrying the c.814G>A and c.1305C>T mutations proved that the two mutations result in exon skipping. mRNAs that harbor a PTC are detected and degraded by the nonsense-mediated mRNA decay (NMD) pathway to prevent synthesis of abnormal proteins. However, although NMD is functional in the patient's fibroblasts, aberrant transcripts are still present. We suggest that the level of correctly spliced transcripts as well as the efficiency in which NMD degrade the PTC-containing transcripts, apparently plays an important role in the phenotype severity of the unique patient and thus should be considered as a potential target for drug therapy.

The abnormalities in the gene coding for the beta-hexosaminidase alpha subunit were analysed from fibroblast's RNAs of 42 Tay-Sachs patients (seven with adult or late onset of Tay-Sachs disease and 35 with infantile Tay-Sachs disease). After first strand synthesis by random priming, PCR was used to amplify in two overlapping fragments (868 and 949 bp) the entire coding region. These amplified products were first studied for changes in size by agarose gel electrophoresis to screen for splicing mutations leading to exon skipping or cryptic splice site activation. For each patient, the two overlapping cDNA fragments were subjected to chemical mismatch cleavage analysis using hydroxylamine to modify C-containing mismatches and osmium tetroxide to modify T-containing mismatches. DGGE was used to screen for mutations in the coding region spanning exon 2 to exon 6, a region putatively encompassing the active site and therefore a potential hot spot of mutations associated with Tay-Sachs disease. To increase the sensitivity of the technique, a 30 bp GC-clamp has been added at the 5' end of the sense oligonucleotide to amplify a fragment of 629 bp. The computerized analysis found that single base changes in domain spanning from nt 313 to nt 693 can be distinguished. Fragments displaying an altered melting behavior or a cleaved product were further analysed by direct sequencing of the amplified material. These methods as a whole allowed us to identify 30/38 alleles studied (79%) with 15 point mutations and one 4 bp insertion detected.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)

The heterogeneity of mutations causing Tay-Sachs disease in non-Jewish populations requires efficient techniques allowing the simultaneous screening for both known and novel mutations. beta-hexosaminidase mRNA isolated from cultured fibroblasts of 19 Tay-Sachs patients (7 with adult or late onset form of the disease and 12 with infantile Tay-Sachs disease) was amplified by cDNA-PCR in two overlapping segments spanning the entire coding sequence. We used chemical mismatch cleavage (CMC), denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (DGGE) and direct sequencing of amplified fragments displaying a cleaved product or an altered melting behavior to screen the HEX A gene for mutations and to determine their distribution and frequency in the non-Jewish Tay-Sachs patients. These methods allowed us to identify 31 out of 38 alleles studied (82%). In addition to 9 previously described mutations (the 4 bp insertion in exon 11, G to A transitions at codons 170, 269, 482, 499 and 504, C to T transition at codon 499 and 504 and a GT to AT transition at the donor site of intron 9), we have identified 10 novel mutations. These include 1 donor splice site defect in intron 6, 8 missense mutations at non-randomly distributed conserved residues and a 2 bp deletion in exon 4. These results confirm the extreme molecular heterogeneity of mutations causing Tay-Sachs disease in non-Jewish population. The strategy used should be profitable for identifying mutations in large genes and for diagnostic purposes.

Tay-Sachs disease is an inherited disorder in which the alpha chain of the lysosomal enzyme beta-N-acetylhexosaminidase A bears the mutation. Ashkenazi Jews are found to be carriers for a severe type of Tay-Sachs disease, the classic form, 10 times more frequently than the general population. Ashkenazi Jewish patients with classic Tay-Sachs disease have appeared to be clinically and biochemically identical, and the usual assumption has been that they harbor the same alpha-chain mutation. In this study I have isolated the alpha-chain gene from an Ashkenazi Jewish patient, GM2968, with classic Tay-Sachs disease and compared its nucleotide sequences with that of the normal alpha-chain gene in the promoter region, exon and splice junction regions, and polyadenylylation signal area. Only one difference was observed between these sequences: at the 5' boundary of intron 12, a guanosine in the conserved splice junction dinucleotide sequence G-T had been altered to a cytidine. The alteration is presumed to be functionally significant and to result in aberrant mRNA splicing. Utilizing the polymerase chain reaction to amplify the region encompassing the mutation, I developed an assay to screen patients and heterozygote carriers for this mutation. Surprisingly, in each of two Ashkenazi patients, only one alpha-chain allele harbored the splice junction mutation. Only one parent of each of these patients was positive for the defect. Another Ashkenazi patient did not bear this mutation at all nor did either of the subject's parents. In addition, 30% of obligate heterozygotes tested carried the splice junction mutation, whereas 20 Ashkenazi Jews designated noncarriers by enzymatic assay were negative for this alteration. The data are consistent with the presence of more than one mutation underlying the classic form of Tay-Sachs disease in the Ashkenazi Jewish population.

Two affected HEXA alleles were found in an Israeli Druze Tay-Sachs child born to first-cousin parents. His paternal allele contained two adjacent changes in exon 5: delta496C, which resulted in a frameshift and premature termination codon 96 nucleotides downstream, and 498C-->G, a silent mutation. The maternal allele had a 835T-->C transition in exon 8 (S279P). Phosphoimaging quantitation of the parents' RNAs showed that the steady-state levels of mRNAs of the mutant exons 5 and 8 were 5% and 50%, respectively, of normal levels. The exon 5 mutated allele with the premature translation termination resulted in severe deficiency of Hex A. Transient expression of the exon 8 mutated alpha-chain cDNA in COS-1 cells resulted in deficiency of enzymatic activity. The child exhibited a late-infantile-type disease.

Tay Sachs disease (TSD) is a neurodegenerative disorder due to β-hexosaminidase A deficiency caused by mutations in the HEXA gene. The mutations leading to Tay Sachs disease in India are yet unknown. We aimed to determine mutations leading to TSD in India by complete sequencing of the HEXA gene. The clinical inclusion criteria included neuroregression, seizures, exaggerated startle reflex, macrocephaly, cherry red spot on fundus examination and spasticity. Neuroimaging criteria included thalamic hyperdensities on CT scan/T1W images of MRI of the brain. Biochemical criteria included deficiency of hexosaminidase A (less than 2% of total hexosaminidase activity for infantile patients). Total leukocyte hexosaminidase activity was assayed by 4-methylumbelliferyl-N-acetyl-β-D-glucosamine lysis and hexosaminidase A activity was assayed by heat inactivation method and 4-methylumbelliferyl-N-acetyl-β-D-glucosamine-6-sulphate lysis method. The exons and exon-intron boundaries of the HEXA gene were bidirectionally sequenced using an automated sequencer. Mutations were confirmed in parents and looked up in public databases. In silico analysis for mutations was carried out using SIFT, Polyphen2, MutationT@ster and Accelrys Discovery Studio softwares. Fifteen families were included in the study. We identified six novel missense mutations, c.340 G>A (p.E114K), c.964 G>A (p.D322N), c.964 G>T (p.D322Y), c.1178C>G (p.R393P) and c.1385A>T (p.E462V), c.1432 G>A (p.G478R) and two previously reported mutations. c.1277_1278insTATC and c.508C>T (p.R170W). The mutation p.E462V was found in six unrelated families from Gujarat indicating a founder effect. A previously known splice site mutation c.805+1 G>C and another intronic mutation c.672+30 T>G of unknown significance were also identified. Mutations could not be identified in one family. We conclude that TSD patients from Gujarat should be screened for the common mutation p.E462V.
