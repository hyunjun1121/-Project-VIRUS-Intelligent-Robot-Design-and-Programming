Which gene is mutated in a subtype of arrhythmogenic right ventricular cardiomyopathy known as Naxos disease?

[PMID: 18937352]
Mutations in genes encoding desmosomal proteins have been implicated in the pathogenesis of heart and skin diseases. This has led to the hypothesis that defective cell-cell adhesion is the underlying cause of injury in tissues that repeatedly bear high mechanical loads. In this study, we examined the effects of two different mutations in plakoglobin on cell migration, stiffness, and adhesion. One is a C-terminal mutation causing Naxos disease, a recessive syndrome of arrhythmogenic right ventricular cardiomyopathy (ARVC) and abnormal skin and hair. The other is an N-terminal mutation causing dominant inheritance of ARVC without cutaneous abnormalities. To assess the effects of plakoglobin mutations on a broad range of cell mechanical behavior, we characterized a model system consisting of stably transfected HEK cells which are particularly well suited for analyses of cell migration and adhesion. Both mutations increased the speed of wound healing which appeared to be related to increased cell motility rather than increased cell proliferation. However, the C-terminal mutation led to dramatically decreased cell-cell adhesion, whereas the N-terminal mutation caused a decrease in cell stiffness. These results indicate that different mutations in plakoglobin have markedly disparate effects on cell mechanical behavior, suggesting complex biomechanical roles for this protein.

Arrhythmogenic right ventricular cardiomyopathy (ARVC) is an inheritable myocardial disorder associated with fibrofatty replacement of myocardium and ventricular arrhythmia. A subset of ARVC is categorized as Naxos disease, which is characterized by ARVC and a cutaneous disorder. A homozygous loss-of-function mutation of the Plakoglobin (Jup) gene, which encodes a major component of the desmosome and the adherens junction, had been identified in Naxos patients, although the underlying mechanism remained elusive. We generated Jup mutant mice by ablating Jup in cardiomyocytes. Jup mutant mice largely recapitulated the clinical manifestation of human ARVC: ventricular dilation and aneurysm, cardiac fibrosis, cardiac dysfunction and spontaneous ventricular arrhythmias. Ultra-structural analyses revealed that desmosomes were absent in Jup mutant myocardia, whereas adherens junctions and gap junctions were preserved. We found that ventricular arrhythmias were associated with progressive cardiomyopathy and fibrosis in Jup mutant hearts. Massive cell death contributed to the cardiomyocyte dropout in Jup mutant hearts. Despite the increase of β-catenin at adherens junctions in Jup mutant cardiomyoicytes, the Wnt/β-catenin-mediated signaling was not altered. Transforming growth factor-beta-mediated signaling was found significantly elevated in Jup mutant cardiomyocytes at the early stage of cardiomyopathy, suggesting an important pathogenic pathway for Jup-related ARVC. These findings have provided further insights for the pathogenesis of ARVC and potential therapeutic interventions.

Arrhythmogenic right ventricular cardiomyopathy (ARVC) is characterised by progressive fibro-fatty replacement of right ventricular myocardium. Earlier studies described ARVC as non-inflammatory, non-coronary disorder associated with arrhythmias, heart failure and sudden death due to functional exclusion of the right ventricle. Molecular genetic studies have identified nine different loci associated with ARVC; accordingly each locus is implicated for each type of ARVC (ARVC1-ARVC9). So far five genes have been identified as containing pathogenic mutations for ARVC. Though mutations in each of the gene/s indicate disruption of different pathways leading to the condition, the exact pathogenesis of the condition is still obscure. This review tries to understand the pathogenesis of the condition by examining the individual proteins implicated and relate them to the pathways that could play a role in the aetiology of the condition. Cardiac ryanodine receptor (RYR-2), which regulates intra-cellular Ca(2+) concentration by releasing Ca(2+) reserves from the sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR), was the first gene for ARVC. The mutation in this gene is believed to disrupt coupled gating of RYR-2, causing after-depolarisation, leading to arrhythmias followed by structural changes due to altered intra-cellular Ca(2+) levels. Three other genes implicated for ARVC, plakoglobin (Naxos disease), desmoplakin (ARVC8) and plakophilin (ARVC9) have prompted the speculation that ARVC is primarily a disease of desmosomes. But identification of TGFbeta-3 for ARVC1 and the role of all these three genes (plakoglobin, desmoplakin and plakophilin) in cardiac morphogenesis indicate some kind of signal-transducing pathway disruption in the condition. The finding that ARVC as a milder form of Uhl's anomaly indicates similar ontogeny for the condition. Further, discovery of apoptotic cells in the autopsy of the right ventricular myocardium of ARVC patients does indicate a common pathway for different types of ARVCs, which is more specific for the right ventricular myocardium involving desmosomal plaque proteins, growth factors and Ca(2+) receptors.

Two sons of a consanguineous marriage developed biventricular cardiomyopathy. One boy died of severe heart failure at the age of 6 years, the other was transplanted because of severe heart failure at the age of 10 years. In addition, focal palmoplantar keratoderma and woolly hair were apparent in both boys. As similar phenotypes have been described in Naxos disease and Carvajal syndrome, respectively, the genes for plakoglobin (JUP) and desmoplakin (DSP) were screened for mutations using direct genomic sequencing. A novel homozygous 2 bp deletion was identified in an alternatively spliced region of DSP. The deletion 5208_5209delAG led to a frameshift downstream of amino acid 1,736 with a premature truncation of the predominant cardiac isoform DSP-1. This novel homozygous truncating mutation in the isoform-1 specific region of the DSP C-terminus caused Carvajal syndrome comprising severe early-onset heart failure with features of non-compaction cardiomyopathy, woolly hair and an acantholytic form of palmoplantar keratoderma in our patient. Congenital hair abnormality and manifestation of the cutaneous phenotype in toddler age can help to identify children at risk for cardiac death.

Inherited ventricular arrhythmias such as the long QT syndrome (LQTS), Brugada syndrome, catecholaminergic polymorphic ventricular tachycardia (CPVT), idiopathic ventricular fibrillation (VF), and arrhythmogenic right ventricular cardiomyopathy (ARVC) account for a relevant proportion of sudden cardiac death cases in young patients cohorts. The detailed pathogenetic mechanisms of inherited ventricular arrhythmias are still poorly understood because systematic investigations are difficult to perform due to low patient numbers and the lack of appropriate experimental models. However, recent advances in research and science have identified a genetic background for many of these diseases. In LQTS, various mutations in different genes encoding for cardiac potassium and sodium channel proteins have been identified ("channelopathy"), and initial progress in genotype-phenotype correlation is made. Mutations in the cardiac sodium channel gene have also been identified in a subset of patients with Brugada syndrome, whereas a genetic background has not yet been demonstrated in idiopathic VF and right ventricular outflow-tract tachycardia (RVO-VT). Very recently, mutations in the cardiac ryanodine receptor gene have been identified in CPVT and in a subgroup of patients with ARVC. Although several chromosomal loci were suggested, no other responsible genes or mutations have been found in autosomal dominant forms of ARVC. However, in Naxos disease, a recessive form of ARVC with coexpression of palmoplantar keratoderma and woolly hair, a mutation in the plakoglobin gene has recently been discovered, thus underscoring the potential role of genetic alterations in cytoskeletal proteins in ARVC. In the next years, significant progress in the genetic diagnosis pathophysiologic understanding of disease mechanisms, genotype-phenotype correlation, and the development of gene- or target-directed treatment strategies can be expected in the field of inherited ventricular arrhythmias. This review summarizes the current knowledge of the molecular mechanisms, including aspects of pathoanatomy, autonomic innervation, genetics, and genotype-phenotype correlations with their potential implications for diagnosis and treatment of inherited ventricular arrhythmias.

The purpose of this study was to examine the genotype-phenotype relation with respect to penetrance, age and severity of expression, disease progression and prognosis in a recessively inherited arrhythmogenic right ventricular cardiomyopathy (ARVC). Naxos disease is a recessively inherited ARVC caused by a mutation in the gene encoding plakoglobin (cell adhesion protein) in which the cardiac phenotype is associated with palmoplantar keratoderma and woolly hair. Twelve families with Naxos disease underwent cardiac and molecular genetic investigation. Serial cardiac assessment with annual resting 12-lead and 24-h ambulatory electrocardiogram (ECG) and two-dimensional echocardiography was performed during 1 to 16 years, median 7 +/- 6 years in all 78 surviving members. Twenty-eight surviving members were homozygous and 40 were heterozygous for the mutation. All adults who were homozygous (n = 26) fulfilled the diagnostic criteria for ARVC, the youngest by the age of 13 years. In eight who were heterozygous, minor ECG or echocardiographic abnormalities were observed. Of the 26 subjects who were affected homozygotes, 92% showed ECG abnormalities, 92% ventricular arrhythmias, 100% right ventricular structural alterations and 27% left ventricular involvement. During follow-up (10 +/- 6 years), 16 (62%) developed structural progression, 12 (46%) arrhythmic events and 7 (27%) heart failure. The annual disease-related and sudden death mortality was 3% and 2.3%, respectively. Autosomal recessive ARVC caused by a mutation in plakoglobin was 100% penetrant by adolescence. Affected subjects who were homozygous experienced progressive disease with adverse prognosis. A minority of subjects who were heterozygous showed minor ECG/echocardiographic changes, but clinically significant disease did not develop.

We tested the hypothesis that defective interactions between adhesion junctions and the cytoskeleton caused by the plakoglobin mutation in Naxos disease lead to remodeling of gap junctions and altered expression of the major gap junction protein, connexin43. Naxos disease, a recessive form of arrhythmogenic right ventricular cardiomyopathy, is associated with a high incidence of arrhythmias and sudden cardiac death. Naxos disease is caused by a mutation in plakoglobin, a protein that links cell-cell adhesion molecules to the cytoskeleton. Myocardial expression of connexin43 and other intercellular junction proteins was characterized in 4 patients with Naxos disease. Immunohistochemistry was performed in all 4 patients, and immunoblotting and electron microscopy were performed in 1 patient who died in childhood before overt arrhythmogenic right ventricular cardiomyopathy had developed. Connexin43 expression at intercellular junctions was reduced significantly in both right and left ventricles in all patients with Naxos disease. Electron microscopy revealed smaller and fewer gap junctions interconnecting ventricular myocytes. Mutant plakoglobin was expressed but failed to localize normally at intercellular junctions. Localization of N-cadherin, alpha- and beta-catenins, plakophilin-2, desmoplakin-1, and desmocollin-2 at intercalated disks appeared normal. Remodeling of gap junctions occurs early in Naxos disease, presumably because of abnormal linkage between mechanical junctions and the cytoskeleton. Gap junction remodeling may produce a coupling defect which, combined with the subsequent development of pathologic changes in myocardium, could contribute to a highly arrhythmogenic substrate and enhance the risk of sudden death in Naxos disease.

Arrhythmogenic right ventricular cardiomyopathy (ARVC) is an autosomal dominant heart muscle disorder that causes arrhythmia, heart failure, and sudden death. Previously we mapped the genetic locus for the triad of autosomal recessive ARVC, palmoplantar keratoderma, and woolly hair (Naxos disease) to chromosome 17q21, in which the gene for plakoglobin is encoded. This protein is a key component of desmosomes and adherens junctions, and is important for the tight adhesion of many cell types, including those in the heart and skin. We studied 19 individuals with Naxos disease, as well as unaffected family members and unrelated individuals from the neighbouring Greek islands of Naxos and Milos. Gene sequence was determined by reverse transcriptase PCR from RNA isolated from the skin of an affected individual and mutations in other cases were confirmed by restriction-enzyme analysis. A homozygous 2 base pair deletion in the plakoglobin gene was identified only in the 19 affected individuals. This deletion caused a frameshift and premature termination of the protein, which was shown by western blot analysis. 29 clinically unaffected family members were heterozygous for the mutation; 20 unrelated individuals from Naxos and 43 autosomal dominant ARVC probands were homozygous for the normal allele. The finding of a deletion in plakoglobin in ARVC suggests that the proteins involved in cell-cell adhesion play an important part in maintaining myocyte integrity, and when junctions are disrupted, cell death, and fibrofatty replacement occur. Therefore, the discovery of a mutation in a protein with functions in maintaining cell junction integrity has important implications for other dominant forms of ARVC, related cardiomyopathies, and other cutaneous diseases.

Arrhythmogenic right ventricular cardiomyopathy (ARVC) is an inherited disorder associated with arrhythmias and sudden death. A recessive mutation in the gene encoding plakoglobin has been shown to cause Naxos disease, a cardiocutaneous syndrome characterized by ARVC and abnormalities of hair and skin. Here, we report, for the first time, a dominant mutation in the gene encoding plakoglobin in a German family with ARVC but no cutaneous abnormalities. The mutation (S39_K40insS) is predicted to insert an extra serine residue at position 39 in the N-terminus of plakoglobin. Analysis of a biopsy sample of the right ventricle from the proband showed markedly decreased localization of plakoglobin, desmoplakin, and connexin43 at intercalated discs in cardiac myocytes. A yeast-two-hybrid screen revealed that the mutant protein established novel interactions with histidine-rich calcium-binding protein and TGF beta induced apoptosis protein 2. Immunoblotting and confocal microscopy in human embryonic kidney 293 (HEK293) cell lines transfected to stably express either wild-type or mutant plakoglobin protein showed that the mutant protein was apparently ubiquitylated and was preferentially located in the cytoplasm, suggesting that the S39_K40insS mutation may increase plakoglobin turnover via proteasomal degradation. HEK293 cells expressing mutant plakoglobin also showed higher rates of proliferation and lower rates of apoptosis than did cells expressing the wild-type protein. Electron microscopy showed smaller and fewer desmosomes in cells expressing mutant plakoglobin. Taken together, these observations suggest that the S39_K40insS mutation affects the structure and distribution of mechanical and electrical cell junctions and could interfere with regulatory mechanisms mediated by Wnt-signaling pathways. These results implicate novel molecular mechanisms in the pathogenesis of ARVC.

Loss-of-function mutation of Jup has been associated with Naxos disease, which is characterized by arrhythmogenic cardiomyopathy and the cutaneous disorder palmoplantar keratoderma. Previously, we have shown that genetic ablation of Jup in cardiomyocytes in mice leads to arrhythmogenic cardiomyopathy similar to Naxos disease in humans. Currently, to determine the pathogenesis of Naxos disease-associated keratoderma, we generated Jup mutant mice by inactivating Jup restrictively in keratinocytes. Jup mutant mice largely recapitulated the clinical features of human palmoplantar keratoderma: overcornification and thickening of the epidermis. Jup mutant mice also suffered skin ulceration and inflammation. Cell apoptosis and proliferation were significantly elevated in Jup mutant epidermis. Ultrastructural analyses revealed the disruption of the assembly of desmosomes and adherens junctions in Jup mutant epidermis. We also demonstrated the compensational increase in β-catenin at Jup mutant cell-cell junctions without altering its signaling activities. Our findings provide important insights for understanding the pathogenesis of human palmoplantar keratoderma.
