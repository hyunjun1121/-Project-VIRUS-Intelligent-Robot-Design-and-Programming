What is the SPRTN protein function?

[PMID: 33348378]
Repair of covalent DNA-protein crosslinks (DPCs) by the metalloprotease SPRTN prevents genome instability, premature aging and carcinogenesis. SPRTN is specifically activated by DNA structures containing single- and double-stranded features, but degrades the protein components of DPCs promiscuously and independent of amino acid sequence. This lack of specificity is useful to target diverse protein adducts, however, it requires tight control in return, in order to prohibit uncontrolled proteolysis of chromatin proteins. Here, we discover the components and principles of a ubiquitin switch, which negatively regulates SPRTN. We demonstrate that monoubiquitylation is induced in an E3 ligase-independent manner and, in contrast to previous assumptions, does not control chromatin access of the enzyme. Data obtained in cells and in vitro reveal that monoubiquitylation induces inactivation of the enzyme by triggering autocatalytic cleavage in trans while also priming SPRTN for proteasomal degradation in cis. Finally, we show that the deubiquitylating enzyme USP7 antagonizes this negative control of SPRTN in the presence of DPCs.

The protease SPRTN emerged as the essential enzyme for DNA-protein crosslink proteolysis repair. Biochemical and cell biological work indicated that SPRTN is a nonspecific protease. Recent and independent studies from Lou, Stingele, and Ramadan reveal that SPRTN activity is modulated via three layers of regulation that make it selective for DNA-protein crosslinks.

The antitumor activity of poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase inhibitors (PARPis) has been ascribed to PARP trapping, which consists in tight DNA-protein complexes. Here we demonstrate that the cytotoxicity of talazoparib and olaparib results from DNA replication. To elucidate the repair of PARP1-DNA complexes associated with replication in human TK6 and chicken DT40 lymphoblastoid cells, we explored the role of Spartan (SPRTN), a metalloprotease associated with DNA replication, which removes proteins forming DPCs. We find that SPRTN-deficient cells are hypersensitive to talazoparib and olaparib, but not to veliparib, a weak PARP trapper. SPRTN-deficient cells exhibit delayed clearance of trapped PARP1 and increased replication fork stalling upon talazoparib and olaparib treatment. We also show that SPRTN interacts with PARP1 and forms nuclear foci that colocalize with the replicative cell division cycle 45 protein (CDC45) in response to talazoparib. Additionally, SPRTN is deubiquitinated and epistatic with translesion synthesis (TLS) in response to talazoparib. Our results demonstrate that SPRTN is recruited to trapped PARP1 in S-phase to assist in the excision and replication bypass of PARP1-DNA complexes.

Covalent DNA-protein crosslinks (DPCs) have emerged as pervasive sources of genome instability. DPCs are targeted for repair by DNA-dependent proteases of the Wss1/SPRTN family. However, understanding how these enzymes achieve specificity has been hampered by the lack of suitable <i>in vitro</i> model substrates. Here, we describe the generation of defined protein-oligonucleotide conjugates as DPC model substrates, which enable the analysis of DPC proteases in activity and binding assays.
