For how long do Drosophila embryos use maternal genome mRNA?

Drosophila Pumilio (Pum) is a founding member of the conserved Puf domain class of RNA-binding translational regulators. Pum binds with high specificity, contacting eight nucleotides, one with each of the repeats in its RNA-binding domain. In general, Pum is thought to block translation in collaboration with Nanos (Nos), which exhibits no binding specificity in isolation but is recruited jointly to regulatory sequences containing a Pum binding site in the 3'-UTRs of target mRNAs. Unlike Pum, which is ubiquitous in the early embryo, Nos is tightly restricted to the posterior, ensuring that repression of its best-characterized target, maternal hunchback (hb) mRNA, takes place exclusively in the posterior. An exceptional case of Nos-independent regulation by Pum has been described-repression of maternal bicoid (bcd) mRNA at the anterior pole of the early embryo, dependent on both Pum and conserved Pum binding sites in the 3'-UTR of the mRNA. We have re-investigated regulation of bcd in the early embryo; our experiments reveal no evidence of a role for Pum or its conserved binding sites in regulation of the perdurance of bcd mRNA or protein. Instead, we find that Pum and Nos control the accumulation of bcd mRNA in testes.

In many animals, the first few hours of life proceed with little or no transcription, and developmental regulation at these early stages is dependent on maternal cytoplasm rather than the zygotic nucleus. Translational control is critical for early Drosophila embryogenesis and is exerted mainly at the gene level. To understand post-transcriptional regulation during Drosophila early embryonic development, we used sucrose polysomal gradient analyses and GeneChip analysis to illustrate the translation profile of individual mRNAs. We determined ribosomal density and ribosomal occupancy of over 10,000 transcripts during the first ten hours after egg laying. We report the extent and general nature of gene regulation at the translational level during early Drosophila embryogenesis on a genome-wide basis. The diversity of the translation profiles indicates multiple mechanisms modulating transcript-specific translation. Cluster analyses suggest that the genes involved in some biological processes are co-regulated at the translational level at certain developmental stages.

In Drosophila embryogenesis, mitotic control undergoes a significant transition during the 14th interphase. Mitoses before interphase 14 run on maternal products, and occur in metasynchronous waves. Mitoses after interphase 14 require zygotic transcription, and occur asyncronously in an intricate, highly ordered spatio-temporal pattern. Mutations at the string (stg) locus cause cell-cycle arrest during this transition, in G2 of interphase 14, yet do not arrest other aspects of development. This phenotype suggests that stg is required specifically for initiating mitosis. We describe the cloning of stg, and show that its predicted amino acid sequence is homologous to that of cdc25, a regular of mitotic initiation in the yeast S. pombe. In addition, we show that zygotic expression of stg mRNA occurs in a dynamic series of spatial patterns which anticipate the patterns of the zygotically driven cell divisions. Therefore we suggest that regulated expression of stg mRNA controls the timing and location of these embryonic cell divisions.
