In which phase of cell cycle does  stress-induced transcription-associated mutagenesis (TAM) occur?

Previously, using a chromosomal reversion assay system, we established that an adaptive mutagenic process occurs in nongrowing Bacillus subtilis cells under stress, and we demonstrated that multiple mechanisms are involved in generating these mutations (41, 43). In an attempt to delineate how these mutations are generated, we began an investigation into whether or not transcription and transcription-associated proteins influence adaptive mutagenesis. In B. subtilis, the Mfd protein (transcription repair coupling factor) facilitates removal of RNA polymerase stalled at transcriptional blockages and recruitment of repair proteins to DNA lesions on the transcribed strand. Here we demonstrate that the loss of Mfd has a depressive effect on stationary-phase mutagenesis. An association between Mfd mutagenesis and aspects of transcription is discussed.

Scientists have been aware for many years of genetic programs that get activated under stress and produce genetic variants in cells that escape non-proliferating conditions. These programs are well conserved in all organisms and expand our view of evolution. They mediate genome instability, create diversity in antibody formation, expand metabolism and increase fitness of pathogens within host environments. Error-prone DNA replication and repair are genetic variability-causing agents that get stimulated by the onset of cellular stresses. Embedded in these programs is the ability to limit mutagenesis to defined genomic regions and times, ensuring integrity of most of the genome. Recent evidence suggests that factors involved in RNA polymerase (RNAP) processivity or transcriptional derepression contribute to the generation of stress-induced mutations. In Bacillus subtilis, transcription-associated mutagenesis has been shown to be independent of recombination-dependent repair and, in some cases, of the Y DNA polymerases. Central to stationary-phase mutagenesis in B. subtilis is the requirement for Mfd, transcription coupling repair factor, which suggests a novel mechanism from those described in other model systems.

Adaptive (stationary phase) mutagenesis is a phenomenon by which nondividing cells acquire beneficial mutations as a response to stress. Although the generation of adaptive mutations is essentially stochastic, genetic factors are involved in this phenomenon. We examined how defects in a transcriptional factor, previously reported to alter the acquisition of adaptive mutations, affected mutation levels in a gene under selection. The acquisition of mutations was directly correlated to the level of transcription of a defective leuC allele placed under selection. To further examine the correlation between transcription and adaptive mutation, we placed a point-mutated allele, leuC427, under the control of an inducible promoter and assayed the level of reversion to leucine prototrophy under conditions of leucine starvation. Our results demonstrate that the level of Leu(+) reversions increased significantly in parallel with the induced increase in transcription levels. This mutagenic response was not observed under conditions of exponential growth. Since transcription is a ubiquitous biological process, transcription-associated mutagenesis may influence evolutionary processes in all organisms.

During transcription, the nontranscribed DNA strand becomes single-stranded DNA (ssDNA), which can form secondary structures. Unpaired bases in the ssDNA are less protected from mutagens and hence experience more mutations than do paired bases. These mutations are called transcription-associated mutations. Transcription-associated mutagenesis is increased under stress and depends on the DNA sequence. Therefore, selection might significantly influence protein-coding sequences in terms of the transcription-associated mutability per transcription event under stress to improve the survival of Escherichia coli. The mutability index (MI) was developed by Wright et al. to estimate the relative transcription-associated mutability of bases per transcription event. Using the most stable fold of each ssDNA that have an average length n, MI was defined as (the number of folds in which the base is unpaired)/nx(highest -DeltaG of all n folds in which the base is unpaired), where DeltaG is the free energy. The MI values show a significant correlation with mutation data under stress but not with spontaneous mutations in E. coli. Protein sequence diversity is preferred under stress but not under favorable conditions. Therefore, we evaluated the selection pressure on MI in terms of the protein sequence diversity for all the protein-coding sequences in E. coli. The distributions of the MI values were lower at bases that could be substituted with each of the other three bases without affecting the amino acid sequence than at bases that could not be so substituted. Start codons had lower distributions of MI values than did nonstart codons. Our results suggest that the majority of protein-coding sequences have evolved to promote protein sequence diversity and to reduce gene knockout under stress. Consequently, transcription-associated mutagenesis increases protein sequence diversity more effectively than does random mutagenesis under stress. Nonrandom transcription-associated mutagenesis under stress should improve the survival of E. coli.

Stress-induced mutagenesis describes the accumulation of mutations that occur in nongrowing cells, in contrast to mutagenesis that occurs in actively dividing populations, and has been referred to as stationary-phase or adaptive mutagenesis. The most widely studied system for stress-induced mutagenesis involves monitoring the appearance of Lac(+) revertants of the strain FC40 under starvation conditions in Escherichia coli. The SOS-inducible translesion DNA polymerase DinB plays an important role in this phenomenon. Loss of DinB (DNA pol IV) function results in a severe reduction of Lac(+) revertants. We previously reported that NusA, an essential component of elongating RNA polymerases, interacts with DinB. Here we report our unexpected observation that wild-type NusA function is required for stress-induced mutagenesis. We present evidence that this effect is unlikely to be due to defects in transcription of lac genes but rather is due to an inability to adapt and mutate in response to environmental stress. Furthermore, we extended our analysis to the formation of stress-induced mutants in response to antibiotic treatment, observing the same striking abolition of mutagenesis under entirely different conditions. Our results are the first to implicate NusA as a crucial participant in the phenomenon of stress-induced mutagenesis.
