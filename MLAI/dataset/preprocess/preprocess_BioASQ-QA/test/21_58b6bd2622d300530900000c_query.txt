Which ApoE isoform is associated with hyperlipoproteinemia?

[PMID: 18823563]
Apolipoprotein E (ApoE) is a molecular scavenger in the blood and brain. Aberrant function of the molecule causes formation of protein and lipid deposits or "plaques" that characterize Alzheimer's disease (AD) and atherosclerosis. There are three human isoforms of ApoE designated epsilon2, epsilon3, and epsilon4. Each isoform differentially affects the structure and function of the protein and thus the development of disease. Homozygosity for ApoE epsilon4 is associated with atherosclerosis and Alzheimer's disease whereas ApoE epsilon2 and epsilon3 tend to be protective. Furthermore, the epsilon2 form may cause forms of hyperlipoproteinemia. Therefore, introduction of ApoE epsilon3 may be beneficial to patients that are susceptible to or suffering from these diseases. Mesenchymal stem cells or multipotent mesenchymal stromal cells (MSCs) are adult progenitor cells found in numerous tissues. They are easily expanded in culture and engraft into host tissues when administered appropriately. Furthermore, MSCs are immunosuppressive and have been reported to engraft as allogeneic transplants. In our previous study, mouse MSCs (mMSCs) were implanted into the brains of ApoE null mice, resulting in production of small amounts of ApoE in the brain and attenuation of cognitive deficits. Therefore human MSCs (hMSCs) are a promising vector for the administration of ApoE epsilon3 in humans. Unlike mMSCs, hMSCs were found not to express ApoE in culture; therefore a molecular screen was performed for compounds that induce expression. PPARgamma agonists, neural stem cell conditioned medium, osteo-inductive media, dexamethasone, and adipo-inductive media (AIM) were tested. Of the conditions tested, only AIM or dexamethasone induced sustained secretion of ApoE in MSCs and the duration of secretion was only limited by the length of time MSCs could be sustained in culture. Upon withdrawal of the inductive stimuli, the ApoE secretion persisted for a further 14 days. The data demonstrated that pre-treatment and perhaps co-administration of MSCs homozygous for ApoE epsilon3 and dexamethasone may represent a novel therapy for severe instances of AD, atherosclerosis and other ApoE-related diseases.

The initial step in the clearance of apolipoprotein (apo) E-enriched remnant lipoproteins from the plasma appears to be sequestration within the liver mediated by their binding to heparan sulfate proteoglycans (HSPG). The surface-bound remnants are believed to be internalized by their interaction with the low density lipoprotein (LDL) receptor-related protein or by the LDL receptor. Cholesterol-induced rabbit beta-very low density lipoproteins (beta-VLDL) enriched in human apoE3 display 4-5-fold enhanced binding to cultured cells. The present study attempts to determine whether recessive versus dominant type III hyperlipoproteinemia might be explained, at least in part, by a variable interaction of the mutant forms of apoE with the HSPG and impaired uptake. The beta-VLDL+apoE2(Arg158-->Cys), which is associated with recessive type III hyperlipoproteinemia, bound more poorly than beta-VLDL+apoE3 but still possessed significant enhanced binding (approximately 2-2.5-fold compared with beta-VLDL without added apoE) to HepG2 and McA-RH7777 cells. In comparison, beta-VLDL+apoE(Arg142-->Cys), beta-VLDL+apoE(Arg145-->Cys), and beta-VLDL+apoE-Leiden, which are associated with dominant type III hyperlipoproteinemia, bound more poorly. This same hierarchy of binding and uptake was determined by [14C]oleate incorporation into cholesteryl esters in LDL receptor-negative cells and by secretion of apoE3 and the variant apoE forms from McA-RH7777 cells. Furthermore, the enhanced binding of the apoE-enriched beta-VLDL was almost totally inhibited by heparinase treatment of the cells, and the basal binding activity was inhibited by 80-90% following addition of an LDL receptor antibody capable of blocking receptor-ligand interaction. The beta-VLDL enriched in apoE or apoE-dimyristoylphosphatidylcholine complexes bound to isolated HSPG from McA-RH7777 cells or the rat liver to a very similar degree. Likewise, the binding of beta-VLDL plus the various forms of apoE to the LDL receptor-related protein on ligand blots paralleled the results of other studies. In conclusion, all of the type III hyperlipoproteinemic apoE variants are defective in displaying enhanced binding to HSPG and in the cellular uptake initiated by HSPG. However, apoE2(Arg158-->Cys) displayed more activity than the variants associated with the dominant forms of type III hyperlipoproteinemia. The hierarchy of binding and uptake was as follows: apoE3 > apoE2(Arg158-->Cys) > apoE(Arg145-->Cys) > apoE(Arg142-->Cys) approximately apoE-Leiden (the latter two usually displaying very little, if any, enhanced binding and uptake). Thus, a correlation exists between the mode of expression of type III hyperlipoproteinemia and the binding and uptake of the specific apoE mutation.

Apolipoprotein (apo) E mediates the removal of chylomicron and very low density lipoprotein remnants from plasma. It is polymorphic in sequence and the products of the three common alleles (epsilon 2, epsilon 3, epsilon 4) differ from one another in their binding to lipoprotein receptors. ApoE2 is defective in binding and homozygosity for apoE2 is associated with type III hyperlipoproteinemia (HLP). Other rare isoforms of apoE have been found to be associated either with dominant type III HLP or with the development of hypertriglyceridemia. We identified a 42 year-old hypertriglyceridemic woman with an apoE phenotype 3/1. Restriction isotyping using AflIII/HaeII resulted in an apparent apoE genotype 3/2, suggesting that the mutation occurred in an epsilon 2 allele. DNA sequence analysis revealed a C-->T point mutation at the first position of the codon for amino acid residue 180 of the mature apoE. This predicted a change Arg(180)-->Cys. The mutation altered a recognition site for the endonuclease HaeII, which allowed us rapidly to screen for this mutation. In relatives of the proband, apoE1 Baden was consistently associated with hypertriglyceridemia. Similar to other apoE variants linked to hypertriglyceridemia, the Arg(180)-->Cys mutation is located within the lipid binding domain of apoE. We therefore suggest that apoE1 Baden may cause hypertrigylceridemia, possibly by inhibiting the hydrolysis of triglycerides associated with very low density lipoproteins.

The diagnosis of type III hyperlipoproteinemia, or remnant disease, is greatly facilitated by the determination of the apoprotein E (apo E) phenotype. The disease is associated, in over 90% of the documented cases, with homozygosity for the E2 isoform of apo E. Phenotyping apo E directly from plasma offers certain advantages as compared to phenotyping from very low density lipoprotein samples. Elaboration of such a procedure in our laboratory allowed us to detect a rare isoform of apo E, apo E1, which was associated with remnant disease in 3 patients.

Type III hyperlipoproteinemia typically is associated with homozygosity for apolipoprotein (apo) E2(Arg158----Cys). Dominant expression of type III hyperlipoproteinemia associated with apoE phenotype E3/3 is caused by heterozygosity for a human apoE variant, apoE3(Cys112----Arg, Arg142----Cys). However, this apoE3 variant was not separable from the normal apoE3 in these patients' plasma because the two proteins have identical amino acid composition, charge, and molecular weight. Therefore, to determine the functional characteristics of this protein, we used recombinant DNA techniques to produce this apoE variant in bacteria. We also produced a non-naturally occurring variant, apoE(Arg142----Cys), that had only the cysteine substituted at residue 142. These two apoE variants were purified from cell lysates of the transfected Escherichia coli by ultracentrifugal flotation in the presence of phospholipid, by gel filtration chromatography, and by heparin-Sepharose chromatography. Both Cys142 apoE variants bound to lipoprotein receptors on human fibroblasts with only about 20% of normal binding activity. Therefore, cysteine at residue 142, not arginine at residue 112, is responsible for the decreased receptor binding activity of the variants. Cysteamine treatment and removal of the carboxyl-terminal domain had little effect on the binding activity, whereas both modulate the receptor binding activity of apoE2(Arg158----Cys). The mutation at residue 142 decreased the binding activity of apoE to both heparin and the monoclonal antibody 1D7 (this antibody inhibits receptor binding of apoE), whereas apoE2(Arg158----Cys), which is associated with recessive expression of type III hyperlipoproteinemia, binds normally to both. The Arg112, Cys142 variant predominantes 3:1 over normal apoE3 in the very low density lipoproteins of plasma from an affected subject, as assessed by differential reactivity with the antibody 1D7. The unique combination of functional properties of the Arg112, Cys142 variant provides a possible explanation for its association with dominant expression of type III hyperlipoproteinemia.

Apolipoprotein E (apoE) is a major constituent of lipoproteins in the plasma and in the brain. There are three common apoE isoforms, termed E2, E3, and E4. By virtue of its ability to bind to lipoprotein receptors, apoE plays a key role in the metabolism of triglyceride-rich lipoproteins in the plasma. Homozygous carriers of apoE2 have an increased risk to develop type III hyperlipoproteinemia, whereas apoE4 is associated with elevated levels of low-density lipoprotein cholesterol. In the brain, apoE is associated with cholesterol-rich lipoproteins and is involved in the transport of cholesterol to neurons. The genetic polymorphism of apoE is among the strongest determinants of the risk and mean age of onset of Alzheimer's disease. The mechanism by which apoE isoforms differentially contribute to disease expression is not known.

Homozygosity for the apolipoprotein (apo) E variant apoE2(158 Arg----Cys) invariably gives rise to dysbetalipoproteinemia, and when associated with obesity or a gene for hyperlipidemia, results in type III hyperlipoproteinemia. The association of the E2/2 phenotype with type IV/V hyperlipoproteinemia rather than type III hyperlipoproteinemia in identical twin brothers led us to investigate the primary structure of their apoE. Lipoprotein electrophoresis on agarose gels confirmed the presence of increased very low density lipoproteins (VLDL) and chylomicrons but little, if any, beta-VLDL, indicating that these subjects did not have dysbetalipoproteinemia. When the apoE from these twins was subjected to sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis on a system that can distinguish apoE2(158 Arg----Cys) from all other known apoE variants, it gave rise to two components. One had the unique mobility of apoE2(158 Arg----Cys), and one migrated in the position of the other variants of apoE (and normal apoE3), indicating that the brothers were heterozygous for apoE2(158 Arg----Cys) and a second apoE2 isoform. Cysteamine modification and isoelectric focusing showed that, like apoE2(158 Arg----Cys), the second apoE2 isoform also contained two cysteine residues. The structural mutation in the second apoE2 isoform was determined by peptide sequencing. Like normal apoE3, this variant had arginine at position 158, but differed from apoE3 by the substitution of cysteine for arginine at position 228. Total apoE isolated from the brothers had the same receptor-binding activity in a competitive binding assay as a 1:1 mixture of normal apoE3 and apoE2(158 Arg----Cys).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)

Apolipoprotein E (apoE) is associated with plasma lipoproteins and is important in modulating the catabolism of remnants of triglyceride-rich lipoproteins. ApoE is a polymorphic protein, and homozygosity for the E2 allele is associated with type III hyperlipoproteinemia. A variant of apoE, apoEBethesda, was found that migrates in the E1 position on isoelectric focusing. Evaluation of the proband and her family showed that both individuals with apoEBethesda had type III hyperlipoproteinemia, and the analysis was consistent with the concept that apoEBethesda was coded by a new E allele and that this allele was expressed in a codominant fashion. The discovery of apoEBethesda and its association with type III hyperlipoproteinemia provides additional evidence for the genetic heterogeneity of the E allele and suggests that a number of different structural mutations of the E apolipoprotein may be associated with the type III phenotype.

To study isoform-specific effects of apolipoprotein E (apoE) in vivo, we generated mice with a human APOE*2 allele in place of the mouse Apoe gene via targeted gene replacement in embryonic stem cells. Mice expressing human apoE2 (2/2) have virtually all the characteristics of type III hyperlipoproteinemia. Their plasma cholesterol and triglyceride levels are both twice to three times those in (normolipidemic) mice that are expressing human apoE3 (3/3) made in an identical manner. The 2/2 mice are markedly defective in clearing beta-migrating VLDL particles, and spontaneously develop atherosclerotic plaques, even on a regular diet. An atherogenic diet, high in fat and cholesterol, exacerbates development of atherosclerosis and xanthomas in the 2/2 mice. Thus, comparisons between the 2/2 and 3/3 mice unequivocally demonstrate that a single amino acid difference (Arg158 Cys) in the apoE protein is sufficient to cause type III HLP and spontaneous atherosclerosis in mice.

Apolipoprotein (apo) E is a 299-residue protein which functions as a key regulator of plasma lipid levels. Human apoE exists as three common isoforms and the parent form, apoE3, operates optimally in promoting clearance of triglyceride (TG)-rich lipoproteins and is associated with normal plasma lipid levels. This result occurs because apoE3 possesses both the requisite lipid-binding ability and affinity for the low density lipoprotein receptor (LDLR) to mediate appropriate lipolytic processing and endocytosis of TG-rich lipoprotein remnant particles. ApoE2 which differs from apoE3 by the single amino acid substitution Arg158Cys located near the LDLR recognition site exhibits impaired binding to the receptor and an inability to promote clearance of TG-rich lipoprotein remnant particles; this isoform is associated with Type-III hyperlipoproteinemia. ApoE4 which differs from apoE3 by the single amino acid substitution Cys112Arg is also associated with dyslipidemia although binding of this isoform to the LDLR is unaffected. The amino acid substitution affects the organization and stability of both the N-terminal helix bundle domain and separately folded C-terminal domain so that apoE4 has enhanced lipid binding ability. As a consequence, apoE4 binds better than apoE3 to the surface of very low density lipoprotein (VLDL) particles and impairs their lipolytic processing in the circulation so that apoE4 is associated with a more pro-atherogenic lipoprotein-cholesterol distribution (higher VLDL-cholesterol/high density lipoprotein-cholesterol ratio). This review summarizes current understanding of the structural differences between apoE2, apoE3, and apoE4, and the molecular mechanisms responsible for the alterations in lipoprotein metabolism resulting from this polymorphism of apoE. Detailed knowledge of how expression of structurally distinct apoE variants modifies lipoprotein metabolism provides a basis for developing ways to manipulate the functionality of apoE in vivo.

Minigel methodology has been utilized for apolipoprotein (apo) E isoform phenotyping and criteria for distinguishing the apoE4/4 phenotype (mean apoE4/apoE3 ratio: 5.81) from the apoE4/3 phenotype (mean ratio: 1.01) and the apoE3/3 phenotype (mean apoE3/apoE2 ratio: 2.67) from the apoE3/2 phenotype (mean ratio: 0.76) based on gel scanning were developed. ApoE allele frequencies in 1209 subjects were: apoE3, 0.786; apoE4, 0.135; apoE2, 0.075; apoE5, 0.002; and apoE1, 0.002. Subjects with the apoE2 allele tended to have higher plasma very low density lipoprotein (VLDL) cholesterol and lower low density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol concentrations than subjects with the apoE3 allele, while the converse was true for subjects with the apoE4 allele. Subjects with the rare apoE1 allele had values similar to those with the apoE2 allele, while subjects with the rare apoE5 allele had values similar to those with the apoE4 allele.

First recognized as a major determinant in lipoprotein metabolism and cardiovascular disease, apolipoprotein (apo) E has emerged as an important molecule in several biological processes not directly related to its lipid transport function, including Alzheimer's disease and cognitive function, immunoregulation, and possibly even infectious diseases. ApoE is a polymorphic protein arising from three alleles at a single gene locus. The three major isoforms, apoE4, apoE3, and apoE2, differ from one another only by single amino acid substitutions, yet these changes have profound functional consequences at both the cellular and molecular levels. ApoE3 seems to be the normal isoform in all known functions, while apoE4 and apoE2 can each be dysfunctional. Isoform (allele)-specific effects include the association of apoE2 with the genetic disorder type III hyperlipoproteinemia and with both increased and decreased risk for atherosclerosis and the association of apoE4 with increased risk for both atherosclerosis and Alzheimer's disease, impaired cognitive function, and reduced neurite outgrowth; isoform-specific differences in cellular signaling events may also exist. Functional differences in the apoE isoforms that affect (or did affect) survival before the reproductive years probably account, at least in part, for the allele frequencies of the present day.

Apolipoprotein E (ApoE) plays a role in the regulation of lipid metabolism in humans. ApoE, a 229-amino-acid polypeptide, is classified into three major isoforms (E2, E3, and E4) according to the differences in amino acids at positions 112 and 158. In the normal population, ApoE3 isoform is the most prevalent, and ApoE2 or E4 is frequently associated with hyperlipoproteinemia. The objective of this work was to investigate the relationship between ApoE gene polymorphism and coronary heart disease (CHD) in Gaza Strip and investigate the association between serum lipid levels and CHD. The study population consisted of 137 subjects including 69 CHD cases (45 male, 24 female) and 68 healthy subjects (33 male and 35 female). The ApoE3/E3 genotype was the most common in the control and the CHD groups. ApoE2/E3 and ApoE3/E4 were the next most common genotypes. The frequencies of ApoE alleles in the CHD subjects were 0.826 for E3, 0.137 for E4, and 0.0362 for E2. These frequencies are comparable to those found in the control group which were 0.875 for the E3, 0.073 for E4, and 0.0515 for E2. No statistically significant differences in ApoE genotypes were found between the patients and the control groups. Moreover, there was no significant difference between the mean of triglyceride (TG) and HDL levels among different ApoE genotypes. However, there was a significant difference in the mean of LDL and ApoE genotypes where the mean of LDL was 218.17 mg/dl in ApoE4, 149.67 mg/dl in ApoE2, and 184.52 mg/dl in ApoE3. A significant difference was also evident between the mean of LDL levels in the CHD and the control group where the mean of LDL was 126 mg/dl in CHD and 111.47 mg/dl in the control group. Our study indicated that there was no significant difference between the mean of cholesterol and TG levels of the CHD and the control groups. To our knowledge, this is the first study in Gaza Strip investigating the relation between ApoE genotypes and CHD. Further investigations are needed to link other genetic factors to CHD.

Lipoprotein glomerulopathy (LPG) is a rare glomerulopathy caused by lipoprotein thrombi. In almost all cases of LPG, several apolipoprotein (apo) E mutations were reported. Here, we present a case of LPG caused by a novel mutation that we named ApoE2 Kurashiki, which substitutes arginine with proline at apoE codon 158. ApoE2 polymorphism is well known for its relationship to type III hyperlipoproteinemia, and the common apoE2 isoform is encoded by the R158C allele. ApoE2 Kurashiki substitutes at the same codon and cannot be distinguished from common apoE2 by stan-dard apoE genotyping or phenotyping.

Type III hyperlipoproteinemia (HLP), a disorder associated with a high incidence of premature cardiovascular diseases, is characterized by the accumulation of remnant lipoproteins in the plasma. The primary genetic defect in patients with type III HLP is the presence of apolipoprotein E2 (apoE2), an isoform of apoE, and accumulation of remnant lipoproteins in the plasma has been thought to be attributable to the presence of apoE2, which bind poorly to low density lipoprotein receptors, resulting in defective remnant lipoprotein clearance. On the other hand, the activity of hepatic lipase (HL), the enzyme that plays a pivotal role in the removal of remnant lipoproteins, in type III HLP has not been investigated. We examined post-heparin plasma lipoprotein lipase (LPL) and HL activities in 7 patients with type III HLP. The activities of HL and LPL in post-heparin plasma were measured separately by an immunochemical method using antiserum specifically directed against HL. The post-heparin plasma HL activity was significantly reduced, while the LPL activity was normal. Reduced HL activity may account, at least in part, for the accumulation of remnant lipoproteins in the plasma, a characteristic feature of type III HLP.

Apolipoprotein E (apo E) plays a role in the regulation of the lipid metabolism of humans. Apo E, 229 amino acid polypeptide, is classified into three major isoform (E2, E3, E4) according to the differences of amino acid in position 112 and 158. In the normal population apo E3 isoform is most prevalent and apo E2 or E4 is frequently associated with hyperlipoproteinemia. To find out the frequency of apo E isoform distribution in the Korean population, apo E genotyping was performed. After amplification of apoE gene by polymerase chain reaction (PCR), restriction isotyping was done by cleavage with restriction enzyme Hha I and polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. The apo E allele frequency in 73 normal subjects was 4.8% for E2, 84.9% for E3 and 10.3% for E4. In diabetic patient with hyperlipoproteinemia, the frequency of apo E allele was 6.3% for E2, 81.0% for E3 and 12.7% for E4. There was no significant difference in apo E isoform distribution between diabetics and normal populations. But in patients with cardiovascular disease with hyperlipidemia, the apo E4 allele frequency was significantly higher than normal (20.0% vs 10.3%, p < 0.005). Apo E3 was the most common isoform in normal and diabetic subjects and apo E2 isoform was rather low frequency compared to Caucasians. This pattern is similar to the Japanese population but somewhat different from other populations. From the data of a high association of apo E4 allele and cardiovascular disease with hypercholesterolemia, apo E isoform may be one of the determinants of hyperlipoproteinemia. The PCR method may be useful in apo E genotyping.

Type III hyperlipoproteinemia is characterized by delayed chylomicron and VLDL remnant catabolism and is associated with homozygosity for the apoE-2 allele. We have identified a kindred in which heterozygosity for an apoE mutant, apoE-1 (Lys146-->Glu), is dominantly associated with the expression of type III hyperlipoproteinemia. DNA sequence analysis of the mutant apoE gene revealed a single-point mutation that resulted in the substitution of glutamic acid (GAG) for lysine (AAG) at residue 146 in the proposed receptor-binding domain of apoE. The pathophysiological effect of this mutation was investigated in vivo by kinetic studies in the patient and six normal subjects, and in vitro by binding studies of apoE-1 (Lys146-->Glu) to LDL receptors on human fibroblasts and to heparin. The kinetic studies revealed that apoE-1 (Lys146-->Glu) was catabolized significantly slower than apoE-3 in normals (P < 0.005). In the proband, the plasma residence times of both apoEs were substantially longer and the production rate of total apoE was about two times higher than in the control subjects. ApoE-1 (Lys146-->Glu) was defective in interacting with LDL receptors, and its ability to displace LDL in an in vitro assay was reduced to 7.7% compared with apoE-3. The affinity of apoE-1 (Lys146-->Glu) to heparin was also markedly reduced compared with both apoE-2 (Arg158-->Cys) and apoE-3. These abnormal in vitro binding characteristics and the altered in vivo metabolism of apoE-1 (Lys146-->Glu) are proposed to result in the functional dominance of this mutation in the affected kindred.

There is agreement about the influence of the genetic apolipoprotein (apo E) polymorphism on plasma lipid and apoprotein levels in man. Whereas the association of the apo E2 isoform with primary dysbetalipoproteinemia and hyperlipoproteinemia type III is well established, the plasma- and LDL-cholesterol lowering effects of apo E2 and the phenomenon of apo E4 raising these parameters on the development of coronary heart disease is still a matter of controversial discussion. Despite these uncertainties the knowledge of an individual's apo E phenotype may provide additional information in future to judge its risk to develop atherosclerosis. From a variety of methods meanwhile described to analyze the polymorphism and evaluate the apo E phenotype the author has modified three procedures to apply to different questions concerning apo E isoform analysis. They concern the visualization of the apo E pattern in diluted solutions and those containing high salt concentrations, the apo E phenotyping on a large scale basis from whole plasma avoiding a possible misinterpretation by a thrombin fragment of apo E and finally the search for new apo E variants with a high resolution system on immobilized pH gradient gels.

Apolipoprotein (apo) E plays an important role in lipid metabolism, and the major isoforms of apoE (apoE2, apoE3, and apoE4) have significantly different metabolic effects. Apolipoprotein E4 is associated with a higher risk of both heart disease and Alzheimer's disease (AD). Patients homozygous for apolipoprotein E2 are predisposed to type III hyperlipoproteinemia, and apoE2 may be protective against AD. Structure/function studies have proved to be a useful tool in understanding how the different apoE isoforms result in different pathological consequences. As these studies continue, it is essential to have a reliable method to produce large quantities of apoE and mutants of apoE. We describe here a method of apoE production in Escherichia coli strain BL21(DE3). The cDNA from apoE isoforms was inserted into a pET32a vector with a T7 promoter and a fusion partner (thioredoxin). The T7 promoter results in high expression of an easily purified His-tagged fusion protein. A thrombin recognition site was positioned in the expression vector so that only two novel amino acids (Gly-Ser) are added to the amino terminus of apoE following the removal of thioredoxin. Approximately 20 mg of apoE is obtained from a 1-liter culture. The major isoforms of apoE produced with this system were extensively characterized for their ability to bind the low-density lipoprotein (LDL) receptor, for their characteristic lipid association preferences, and for their stability as measured by guanidine denaturation. The recombinant proteins behaved identically to plasma-derived apoE isoforms.

The primary receptor mediating clearance of apolipoprotein (apo)E- and apoB100-containing lipoproteins from the circulation is the low density lipoprotein (LDL) receptor. Reduced expression of the LDLR is believed to be a precipitating factor in the pathogenesis of type III hyperlipoproteinemia (HLP) in some humans homozygous for the apoE2 allele (APOE*2). To test the effect of genetic changes in LDL receptor expression on the pathogenesis of type III HLP, we have generated a variant allele at the endogenous mouse Ldlr locus that expresses the human LDL receptor transcript. Transcription of the human LDLR minigene is regulated by the endogenous mouse promoter sequence, but a truncation of 3'-untranslated region results in increased mRNA stability. Consequently, in liver of heterozygotes, steady state levels of mouse and human LDLR transcripts are 50 and 180% the levels of total transcript in wild type mice, respectively. Overall, the 2.3-fold normal level of LDLR message in heterozygotes completely ameliorates type III HLP caused by the homozygosity for the human APOE*2 allele, normalizing their plasma lipoprotein profile. We conclude that a modest increase in expression of the LDLR through message stabilization is sufficient to prevent precipitation of type III HLP in mice.

Apolipoprotein E (apoE) is important in the modulation of the catabolism of chylomicron and very low density lipoprotein (VLDL) remnants. ApoE has three major genetically determined isoproteins in plasma, designated apoE-2, apoE-3 and apoE-4, with homozygosity for the allele coding for apoE-2 being associated with dysbetalipoproteinemia or type III hyperlipoproteinemia (HLP). We describe a new variant of apoE, apoE-1Harrisburg, which is, in contrast to apoE-2, dominantly associated with type III HLP. Five of twelve members of the affected kindred are heterozygous for the mutant form of apoE, and four of the five have type III HLP, while the fifth member has dysbetalipoproteinemia on diet therapy. Neuraminidase digestion, which removes charged sialic acid residues, did not alter the electrophoretic position of the apoE-1Harrisburg isoprotein, indicating that the altered charge of apoE-1Harrisburg was not due to sialic acid addition to the apolipoprotein. Cysteamine modification, which adds a positively charged group to cysteine, resulted in a shift of apoE-1Harrisburg from the E-1 to the E-2 isoform position, indicating that there is one cysteine in apoE-1Harrisburg as is the case for apoE-3. These results are consistent with apoE-1Harrisburg originating in the allele for apoE-3 with the mutation leading to a negative two-unit charge shift. The definitive identification of a kindred with an apoE variant, apoE-1Harrisburg, dominantly associated with dysbetalipoproteinemia and type III HLP provides a unique opportunity to gain important insights into the structure-function requirements of the E apolipoprotein as well as the mechanisms by which apoE modulates lipoprotein metabolism.
