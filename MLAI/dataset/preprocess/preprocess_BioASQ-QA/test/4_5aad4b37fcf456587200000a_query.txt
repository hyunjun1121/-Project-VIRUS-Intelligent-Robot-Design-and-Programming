For top-down protein database search and identification from tandem mass spectra, our isotopic envelope fingerprinting search algorithm and ProteinGoggle search engine have demonstrated their strength of efficiently resolving heavily overlapping data as well separating non-ideal data with non-ideal isotopic envelopes from ideal ones with ideal isotopic envelopes. Here we report our updated ProteinGoggle 2.0 for intact protein database search with full-capacity. The indispensable updates include users' optional definition of dynamic post-translational modifications and static chemical labeling during database creation, comprehensive dissociation methods and ion series, as well as a Proteoform Score for each proteoform. ProteinGoggle has previously been benchmarked with both collision-based dissociation (CID, HCD) and electron-based dissociation (ETD) data of either intact proteins or intact proteomes. Here we report our further benchmarking of the new version of ProteinGoggle with publically available photon-based dissociation (UVPD) data (http://hdl.handle.net/2022/17316) of intact E. coli ribosomal proteins. Protein species (aka proteoforms) function at their molecular level, and diverse structures and biological roles of every proteoform come from often co-occurring proteolysis, amino acid variation and post-translational modifications. Complete and high-throughput capture of this combinatorial information of proteoforms has become possible in evolving top-down proteomics; yet, various methods and technologies, especially database search and bioinformatics identification tools, in the top-down pipeline are still in their infancy stages and demand intensive research and development.

Although proteomics has rapidly developed in the past decade, researchers are still in the early stage of exploring the world of complex proteoforms, which are protein products with various primary structure alterations resulting from gene mutations, alternative splicing, post-translational modifications, and other biological processes. Proteoform identification is essential to mapping proteoforms to their biological functions as well as discovering novel proteoforms and new protein functions. Top-down mass spectrometry is the method of choice for identifying complex proteoforms because it provides a 'bird's eye view' of intact proteoforms. The combinatorial explosion of various alterations on a protein may result in billions of possible proteoforms, making proteoform identification a challenging computational problem. We propose a new data structure, called the mass graph, for efficient representation of proteoforms and design mass graph alignment algorithms. We developed TopMG, a mass graph-based software tool for proteoform identification by top-down mass spectrometry. Experiments on top-down mass spectrometry datasets showed that TopMG outperformed existing methods in identifying complex proteoforms. http://proteomics.informatics.iupui.edu/software/topmg/. xwliu@iupui.edu.

In recent decades, studies in the molecular origins of socially significant diseases have made a big step forward with the development and using of high-performance methods in genomics and proteomics. Numerous studies in the framework of the global program "Human Proteome" were aimed at the identification of all possible proteins in various cell cultures and tissues, including cancer. One of the objectives was to identify biomarkers - proteins with high specificity to certain pathologies. However, in many cases, it is shown that the development of the disease is not associated with the appearance of new proteins, but depends on the level of gene expression or forming of proteoforms - splice variants, single amino acid substitutions (SAP variants), and post-translational modifications (PTM) of proteins. PTM may play a key role in the development of pathology because they activate a variety of regulatory or structural proteins in the majority of cell physiological processes. Phosphorylation is among the most significant of these protein modifications.This review will describe methods for analysis of protein phosphorylation used in the studies of such diseases as cancer and neurodegenerative diseases, as well as examples of cases when the modified proteins are involved directly to their development, and screening such significant PTM is used for the diagnosis and choice of treatment.

Proteogenomics is a research area that combines areas as proteomics and genomics in a multi-omics setup using both mass spectrometry and high-throughput sequencing technologies. Currently, the main goals of the field are to aid genome annotation or to unravel the proteome complexity. Mass spectrometry based identifications of matching or homologues peptides can further refine gene models. Also, the identification of novel proteoforms is also made possible based on detection of novel translation initiation sites (cognate or near-cognate), novel transcript isoforms, sequence variation or novel (small) open reading frames in intergenic or un-translated genic regions by analyzing high-throughput sequencing data from RNAseq or ribosome profiling experiments. Other proteogenomics studies using a combination of proteomics and genomics techniques focus on antibody sequencing, the identification of immunogenic peptides or venom peptides. Over the years, a growing amount of bioinformatics tools and databases became available to help streamlining these cross-omics studies. Some of these solutions only help in specific steps of the proteogenomics studies, e.g. building custom sequence databases (based on next generation sequencing output) for mass spectrometry fragmentation spectrum matching. Over the last few years a handful integrative tools also became available that can execute complete proteogenomics analyses. Some of these are presented as stand-alone solutions, whereas others are implemented in a web-based framework such as Galaxy. In this review we aimed at sketching a comprehensive overview of all the bioinformatics solutions that are available for this growing research area. Â© 2015 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.
