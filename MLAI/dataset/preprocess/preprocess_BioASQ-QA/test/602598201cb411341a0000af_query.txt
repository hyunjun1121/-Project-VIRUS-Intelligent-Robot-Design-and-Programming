What does bDMARD stand for?

[PMID: 30876919]
The introduction of biological disease-modifying antirheumatic drug (bDMARD) treatments for various types of autoimmune arthritis, such as rheumatoid arthritis, psoriatic arthropathy and ankylosing spondylitis, represents a new era of treatment for patients with a refractory response to conventional synthetic DMARDs (csDMARDs). Many new bDMARDs with different modalities or that target different pro-inflammatory molecules, likely cytokines, are rapidly emerging. Hence, physicians in the field may be confused about choosing appropriate bDMARDs for their patients. Considering the high cost of bDMARDs and the rapid destructive process of autoimmune arthritis in patients, the choice of optimal bDMARDs for patients who fail to respond or show an inadequate therapeutic response to csDMARDs designed to control the disease is very critical. Here, we summarize the strengths and weaknesses of bDMARDs and specifically focus on their uses in patients with comorbid conditions or with specific medical conditions, such as pregnancy. This commentary provides a solid up-to-date review on commercially available bDMARDs and very useful information for physicians to facilitate the choice of more appropriate bDMARDs to treat patients with autoimmune arthritis and for basic researchers to understand the current strategies of bDMARD usage and hopefully to develop more powerful bDMARDs with fewer safety concerns.

To establish in a global setting the relationships between countries' socioeconomic status (SES), measured biological disease modifying antirheumatic drug (bDMARD)-usage and disease outcomes. To assess if prescription and reimbursement rules and generic access to medication relates to a countries' bDMARD-usage. Data on disease activity and drug use from countries that had contributed at least 100 patients were extracted from the METEOR database. Mean disease outcomes of all available patients at the final visit were calculated on a per-country basis. A questionnaire was sent to at least two rheumatologists per country inquiring about DMARD-prices, access to treatment and valid regulations for prescription and reimbursement. Data from 20 379 patients living in 12 different countries showed that countries' SES was positively associated with measured disease activity (meanDAS28), but not always with physical functioning (HAQ-score). A lower country's SES, stricter rules for prescription and reimbursement of bDMARDs as well as worse affordability of bDMARDs were associated with lower bDMARD-usage. bDMARD-usage was negatively associated with disease activity (although not with physical functioning), but the association was moderate at best. Disease activity in patients with rheumatoid arthritis as well as bDMARD-usage varies across countries worldwide. The (negative) relationship between countries' bDMARD-usage and level of disease activity is complex and under the influence of many factors, including-but not limited to-countries' SES, affordability of bDMARDs and valid prescription and reimbursement rules for bDMARDs.

In the present study we evaluated how systemic arterial hypertension (SAH), dyslipidemia and diabetes mellitus influence the efficacy, safety and retention rate of biological disease-modifying anti-rheumatic drug (bDMARD) treatment in rheumatic musculoskeletal disorders (RMDs). The charts of RMD patients treated with the first-line bDMARD were reviewed, collecting data on safety, efficacy and comorbidities at prescription (baseline, BL), after 6 months (6M) and at last observation on bDMARD (last observation time, LoT). In 383 RMD patients, a higher rate of adverse events at 6M (<i>p</i> = 0.0402) and at LoT (<i>p</i> = 0.0462) was present in dyslipidemic patients. Patients who developed dyslipidemia or SAH during bDMARD treatment had similar results (dyslipidemia <i>p</i> = 0.0007; SAH <i>p</i> = 0.0319) with a longer bDMARD retention as well (dyslipidemia <i>p</i> < 0.0001; SAH <i>p</i> < 0.0001). SAH patients on angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEis) or angiotensin-II receptor blockers (ARBs) continued bDMARDs for longer than non-exposed patients (<i>p</i> = 0.001), with higher frequency of drug interruption for long-standing remission rather than inefficacy or adverse reactions (<i>p</i> = 0.0258). Similarly, dyslipidemic patients on statins had a better bDMARD retention than not-exposed patients (<i>p</i> = 0.0420). In conclusion, SAH and dyslipidemia may be associated with higher frequency of adverse events but a better drug retention of first-line bDMARD in RMDs, suggesting an additional effect of ACEis/ARBs or statins on the inflammatory process and supporting their use in RMD bDMARD patients with SAH/dyslipidemia.

Biologic disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs (bDMARDs) used for rheumatoid arthritis (RA) treatment have several mechanisms of action. Interleukin-6 inhibitors (IL-6i) block the production of acute-phase reactants (APRs), which are some of the composite measures of disease activity. We undertook this study to examine the agreement between the European League Against Rheumatism (EULAR) response based on the erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) or C-reactive protein level, the Simplified Disease Activity Index 50% response measure (SDAI50), and the Clinical Disease Activity Index 50% response measure (CDAI50) in patients treated with IL-6i and other bDMARDs. We enrolled 306 patients with RA who started or switched bDMARDs. Treatment response at 6 months was analyzed. Kappa statistics were used to evaluate the agreement between different response measures. The contribution of APRs to improvement in disease activity scores was examined. The change of Health Assessment Questionnaire (HAQ) score was analyzed in IL-6i-treated patients. Good agreement was achieved between response measures, with κ >0.6 in patients treated with tumor necrosis factor inhibitors or cytotoxic T-lymphocyte-associated antigen 4 immunoglobulin fusion protein. In IL-6i-treated patients, the agreement was low between the EULAR response (ESR) and the SDAI50 or the CDAI50 (κ = 0.43 and 0.37, respectively). Under IL-6i treatment, APR improvement accounted for 56.0% of total improvement of the Disease Activity Score in 28 joints (DAS28) using the ESR. When discordance was found between the CDAI50 and EULAR response in IL-6i-treated patients, all patients were classified as EULAR-only responders; there was no HAQ improvement in EULAR-only responders. EULAR response criteria overestimate the response under IL-6i treatment because the APR improvement largely contributes to the DAS28 improvement.

Biologic disease-modifying anti-rheumatic drugs (bDMARDs) are used in pregnant patients with rheumatic diseases. Long-term follow-up data about newborns exposed to bDMARDs during pregnancy are however scarce. Here we summarize the published evidence and available recommendations for use of bDMARDs during pregnancy. We analyse clinical features at birth and at follow-up of 84 children, including: 16 consecutive children born to mothers with autoimmune diseases exposed to bDMARDs in utero; 32 children born to mothers with autoimmune diseases who did not receive bDMARDs; 36 children born to healthy mothers. In our monocentric cohort, children born to mothers with autoimmune diseases had lower gestational age at birth compared to those born to healthy mothers, independently of exposure to bDMARDs. At multivariate analysis, prematurity was an independent predictor of the need for antibiotic treatment, but not for hospitalisation or neonatal intensive care unit (ICU) stay during the neonatal period. Exposure to bDMARDs during pregnancy does not seem to interfere with post-natal development up to infancy. Prospective studies are needed in larger cohorts of pregnant patients to confirm that bDMARDs do not have a negative impact on psychomotor achievements in newborns.

To examine the rate, risks factors, and consequences of neutropenia induced by intravenous (IV) biologic disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs (bDMARD). We conducted a retrospective cohort study in 499 patients with rheumatic diseases treated by IV abatacept (ABA), infliximab (IFX), or tocilizumab (TCZ). Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) was the most frequent diagnosis (72%). Fifty-two patients (10.4%) experienced at least 1 episode of neutropenia. No episodes of grade 4 neutropenia were documented. TCZ was more frequently related to neutropenia than ABA or IFX (18.6% vs 3.8% and 2.8%, respectively, p < 0.001). The following factors were identified as predictors of experiencing neutropenia with IV bDMARD: history of neutropenia with methotrexate (MTX; synthetic DMARD; OR 1.56, 95% CI 1.17-7.14), concomitant treatment by MTX (OR 1.21, 95% CI 1.01-2.64), and TCZ treatment (OR 2.72, 95% CI 1.53-9.05). Patients experiencing a TCZ-induced neutropenia did not show a higher risk of severe infections; however, this group had a shorter drug survival (9 mos vs 20 mos, p < 0.02) compared with TCZ patients without neutropenia. Among 3 different classes of IV bDMARD, TCZ is associated with the higher risk of neutropenia. No increased frequency of infection episodes was documented in this group.

Biologic disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs (bDMARDs) are engineered proteins with high affinity for various proinflammatory immune mediators to reduce inflammation and its sequelae in various rheumatic diseases. These medications, introduced at the advent of the 21st century, have revolutionized the treatment of axial spondyloarthritis (including ankylosing spondylitis) and psoriatic arthritis. Currently approved bDMARDs for axial spondyloarthritis are etanercept, infliximab, adalimumab, golimumab, certolizumab pegol, and secukinumab. For psoriatic arthritis, all of these drugs are approved in addition to ixekizumab, ustekinumab, abatacept, and tofacitinib. Selection of the optimal bDMARD should consider patient comorbidity including uveitis, psoriasis, and inflammatory bowel disease.

Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is characterized by chronic synovial inflammation due to unknown causes. Conventional synthetic disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs (csDMARDs), biological DMARDs (bDMARDs), and tofacitinib, a targeted sDMARD, can be used to treat RA. In clinical trials, molecular-targeted therapies showed a significant reduction in RA symptoms and provided pain relief for patients with active RA. Even if patients did not show clinical improvement with combination therapy with a bDMARD and methotrexate (MTX), some patients showed a significant inhibition in structural damage. The clinical efficacies of tofacitinib were shown to be equivalent to adalimumab, a bDMARD, in patients with RA treated with MTX. MTX is the first-line agent for the treatment of RA. Higher doses of MTX might be needed to maintain the effects of bDMARDs. Patients receiving some bDMARDs have been shown to have a higher risk for serious infections; thus, pre-screening for infections is important before beginning treatment with bDMARDs. The rates of patients maintaining targeted levels of disease activity after stopping bDMARDs are relatively low. It is uncertain whether remission or low disease activity can be maintained after stopping molecular-targeted therapies. The development of bDMARDs and targeted-molecular sDMARDs has provided a wide range of treatment options for RA. Patients with active RA should be treated with a treat-to-target strategy after assessment of risks and benefits.

Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is a chronic inflammatory disease characterized by persistent joint inflammation, systemic inflammation, and immunological abnormalities. Because cytokines such as tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-α and interleukin (IL)-6 play a major role in the development of RA, their targeting could constitute a reasonable novel therapeutic strategy for treating RA. Indeed, worldwide clinical trials of TNF inhibiting biologic disease modifying antirheumatic drugs (bDMARDs) including infliximab, adalimumab, golimumab, certolizumab pegol, and etanercept as well as the humanized anti-human IL-6 receptor antibody, tocilizumab, have demonstrated outstanding clinical efficacy and tolerable safety profiles, resulting in worldwide approval for using these bDMARDs to treat moderate to severe active RA in patients with an inadequate response to synthetic disease modifying antirheumatic drugs (sDMARDs). Although bDMARDs have elicited to a paradigm shift in the treatment of RA due to the prominent efficacy that had not been previously achieved by sDMARDs, a substantial percentage of patients failed primary or secondary responses to bDMARD therapy. Because RA is a heterogeneous disease in which TNF-α and IL-6 play overlapping but distinct pathological roles, further studies are required to determine the best use of TNF inhibitors and tocilizumab in individual RA patients.

Objective Biological disease-modifying anti-rheumatic drugs (bDMARDs) represent an important advance in alleviating rheumatoid arthritis (RA), but their effect on rheumatic airway disease (AD) and interstitial lung disease (ILD) is still unclear. This study was performed to evaluate the association of the use of different bDMARDs with new-onset or worsening of RA-AD/ILD. Methods We performed a retrospective cohort study of RA patients who received bDMARDs and assessed their AD/ILD before and after drug initiation in our hospital over the past 10 years. We evaluated the serial changes in computed tomography (CT), classified patients according to AD/ILD progression, and analyzed associations between clinical characteristics and outcomes. Results We enrolled 49 patients. Thirty patients received tumor necrosis factor inhibitors (TNFis), 12 received abatacept (ABT), and the remaining 7 received tocilizumab (TCZ). Seventeen patients had ILD, 10 had AD, and 6 had both AD and ILD before the initiation of bDMARDs. New emergence or exacerbation of AD/ILD was observed in 18 patients after drug initiation, while the remaining 31 remained stable or improved. Multiple logistic regression analyses revealed that pre-existing AD was an independent risk factor against the emergence or exacerbation of RA-AD/ILD, and ABT use was a protective factor against it. Conclusion Our study showed that pre-existing RA-AD is associated with future worsening of RA-AD/ILD, and ABT over other bDMARDs was associated with a better prognosis. Future studies to confirm our results are needed.

Biologic disease modifying antirheumatic drugs (bDMARDs) can be highly efficient in the treatment of various non-infectious uveitis entities. Currently, the TNF-α-inhibitor Adalimumab is the only in-label therapeutic option, whereas, all other bDMARDs need to be given as an off-label therapy. bDMARDs are indicated in diseases refractory to conventional synthetic DMARD therapy and/or systemic steroids, or in patients in whom treatment with those is not possible due to side effects. Therapeutic mechanisms currently employed are cytokine-specific (interferons, inhibition of TNF-α or of interleukin [IL]-1-, IL-6- or IL-17-signalling), inhibit T cell costimulation (CTLA-4 fusion protein), or act via depletion of B cells (anti-CD20). All bDMARDs need to be administered parenterally, and therapy is initiated by the treating internal specialist only after interdisciplinary coordination of all treating subspecialties and after exclusion of contraindications. Regular clinical and laboratory monitoring is mandatory for all patients while under bDMARD therapy.

Biological disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs (bDMARDs) are recommended for rheumatoid arthritis (RA), but older patients reportedly experience more adverse events (AEs) and show variable treatment response. The objective of this study was to evaluate AEs and effectiveness of bDMARDs in a cohort of older patients. AE and treatment effectiveness (based on DAS28 scores) data from a prospective provincial pharmacovigilance program for the years 2006-2009 in patients 55-64, 65-74, and 75+ years of age were compared. An intention to treat analysis with chi-square and unpaired <i>t</i>-testing for significance was performed. There were a total of 333 patients (156 were aged 55-64, 125 were 65-74, 52 were 75+). Those 75+ had higher disease activity and worse functional status at baseline. Among those 75+, AEs with bDMARDs were more common and likely to lead to discontinuation of therapy, be graded as severe, and classified as infectious (<i>p</i> < .05). Remission rate among those 75+ was significantly higher than patients 65-74. Etanercept was the most commonly used drug in all age groups. Patients 75+ treated with bDMARDs are at a significantly greater risk of AEs, including infectious ones. The higher remission found in the oldest age group warrants further study.
