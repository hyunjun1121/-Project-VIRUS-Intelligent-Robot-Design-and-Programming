What is etarfolatide used for?

[PMID: 26238440]
Technetium etarfolatide ((99m)Tc-EF) is a radioactive diagnostic imaging agent that was developed to assess the expression of folate receptors in tumors. Administering folic acid prior to the administration of (99m)Tc-EF has been shown to improve SPECT images. Here, we conducted a phase I clinical trial to assess the safety, pharmacokinetics, and radiation dosimetry of (99m)Tc-EF injection following pre-administration of folic acid in healthy Japanese male adults. Six healthy Japanese male adults were enrolled in the study. Folic acid was intravenously administered, followed 1-3 min later by an intravenous injection of (99m)Tc-EF (740 MBq ± 20 %). Assessments of subjective symptoms and objective findings, electrocardiograms, physical examination, and laboratory tests were performed before and up to 7 days after the injection to assess the safety of (99m)Tc-EF. Blood and urine collections and whole-body planar imaging were conducted at various time points up to 24 h after the injection to assess the pharmacokinetics of (99m)Tc-EF. The internal radiation dosimetry was calculated based on the pharmacokinetics results using the MIRD method. Five adverse events were observed in three subjects (50 %) after administration of the folic acid and (99m)Tc-EF, while these events were mild and non-serious. Of those five events, three were considered to be related to the administered agents. The radioactivity in blood rapidly decreased and showed a biphasic profile. The activity of (99m)Tc-EF at 5 min post injection was largest in the bone marrow, followed by the liver and kidneys, and had decreased within 24 h in all organs/tissues without appreciable retention. The pharmacokinetics results suggested that (99m)Tc-EF was mainly eliminated by kidney. The results also suggested that when administered at 925 MBq of (99m)Tc-EF, which is the maximum dose generally used for clinical trials in other countries, the corresponding effective dose of (99m)Tc-EF is equal to or less than those determined for the current radioactive diagnostic imaging agents. The results of this study assessing the safety and radiation dosimetry of (99m)Tc-EF with folic acid pre-administration suggested that folic acid and (99m)Tc-EF should be appropriate for further studies. No pharmacokinetics concerns were noted.

This report examines (99m)Tc-etarfolatide imaging to identify the presence of folate receptor (FR) on tumors of women with recurrent/refractory ovarian or endometrial cancer and correlates expression with response to FR-targeted therapy (vintafolide). In this phase II, single-arm, multicenter study, patients with advanced ovarian cancer were imaged with (99m)Tc-etarfolatide before vintafolide treatment. Up to 10 target lesions (TLs) were selected based on Response Evaluation Criteria In Solid Tumors criteria using computed tomography scans. Single-photon emission computed tomography images of TLs were assessed for (99m)Tc-etarfolatide uptake as either FR positive or negative. Patients were categorized by percentage of TLs positive and grouped as FR(100%), FR(10%-90%), and FR(0%). Lesion and patient response were correlated with etarfolatide uptake. Forty-nine patients were enrolled; 43 were available for analysis. One hundred thirty-nine lesions were (99m)Tc-etarfolatide evaluable: 110 FR positive and 29 FR negative. Lesion disease control rate (DCR = stable or response) was observed in 56.4% of FR-positive lesions versus 20.7% of FR-negative lesions (P < 0.001). Patient DCR was 57%, 36%, and 33% in FR(100%), FR(10%-90%), and FR(0%) patients, respectively. Median overall survival was 14.6, 9.6, and 3.0 months in FR(100%), FR(10%-90%), and FR(0%) patients, respectively. Overall response to FR-targeted therapy and DCR correlate with FR positivity demonstrated by (99m)Tc-etarfolatide imaging. NCT00507741.

Conventional cancer treatment modalities have several limitations including lack of sufficient efficacy, serious untoward toxicity, as well as innate and acquired drug resistance. In contrast, targeted imaging agents can identify patients with receptors overexpressed on the surface of cancer cells, thus allowing appropriate selection of patients for personalized treatment with a desirable targeted therapeutic. The folate receptor (FR) has been identified as a new molecularly targeted entity, which is highly overexpressed on the surface of a spectrum of solid tumor cells, including ovarian, kidney, lung, brain, endometrial, colorectal, pancreatic, gastric, prostate, testicular, bladder, head and neck, breast, and non-small cell lung cancer. Folic acid conjugation is a novel approach for targeting FR-expressing tissues for personalized treatment. With the development of FRα-targeted therapies comes a concomitant prerequisite for reliable methods for the quantification of FRα tissue expression. Therefore, attaching a radioactive probe to folic acid to target diseased tissue has become a novel and powerful imaging technique. Currently available diagnostic tools frequently require invasive surgical biopsy. In contrast, the noninvasive single-photon emission computed tomography-based companion imaging agent, (99m)Tc-etarfolatide ((99m)Tc-EC20), is in development for use as a companion diagnostic with the FRα-targeted folate conjugate, vintafolide (EC145), to identify patients whose tumors express FRα. Vintafolide is a folic acid conjugate of Vinca alkaloid (desacetylvinblastine hydrazide) that targets FRα-expressing tumors, thereby disrupting microtubule polymerization. (99m)Tc-etarfolatide is taken up by FR-positive tumors and allows for noninvasive, whole-body monitoring of FRα expression status throughout treatment. The combination of vintafolide plus etarfolatide has been evaluated in three Phase 2 studies for the treatment of various solid tumors, including ovarian, endometrial, peritoneal, and platinum-resistant ovarian cancer, as well as lung cancer. Patients with FR-positive tumors, as identified by etarfolatide uptake, have had better clinical outcomes than patients with FR-negative tumors, indicating the potential of etarfolatide as a companion biomarker for predicting vintafolide response. Targeted therapies combined with a reliable companion diagnostic test represent a novel approach toward efficient personalized medicine for malignant and nonmalignant disorders. Furthermore, the recent availability of the crystal structures of FRα and FRβ in complex with folates and antifolates forms a realistic basis for the rational design and implementation of novel FR-targeted drugs for the treatment of cancer and inflammatory disorders.

Through binding to folate receptor-β (FR-β), the new (99m)Tc-EC20 (Etarfolatide) imaging technique detects activated but not resting macrophages in vivo. The goal of this study was to investigate macrophage-related inflammation in osteoarthritis (OA). Twenty-five individuals (50 knees) with symptomatic OA of at least one knee underwent SPECT-CT imaging of both knees and planar imaging of the whole body after injection of Etarfolatide. Scans and knee radiographs were scored blinded to clinical information including knee and other joint site pain severity. Measures of association controlled for age, gender, body mass index (BMI) and employed repeated measures to adjust for correlation between knees. Activated macrophages were present in the majority (76%) of knees. The quantity of knee-related macrophages was significantly associated with knee pain severity (R = 0.60, P < 0.0001) and radiographic knee OA severity including joint space narrowing (R = 0.68, P = 0.007), and osteophyte (R = 0.66, P = 0.001). Macrophages were also localized to joints commonly affected by OA including hand finger joints (12%), thumb bases (28%), shoulders (26%), great toes (18%) and ankles (12%). The presence of joint pain at fingers, wrists, ankles and great toes was significantly positively associated with presence of activated macrophages at these sites (P < 0.0001-0.04). This study provides the first direct in vivo evidence for macrophage involvement in OA in a substantial proportion of human knees. The association of quantity of activated macrophages with radiographic knee OA severity and joint symptoms suggests that drugs targeting macrophages and macrophage-associated inflammatory pathways may have the potential to be both symptom and structure modifying.

Seminal advances in the treatment of cancer have been achieved because of drug development in ovarian cancer; notably the developments of platinums and taxanes. However, no new drug has been FDA approved for ovarian cancer since 2006, and the approval of an antiangiogenic agent for ovarian cancer in the US has stalled. Predicting the next breakthrough is a high risk and highly expensive venture. One of the most promising prospects is folate-receptor (FR)-targeted therapy, given the high expression in FR ovarian cancer. We review the development of vintafolide (EC145), a folic acid-desacetylvinblastine conjugate, the predictive utility of a FR-targeted imaging agent, technetium-(99)m-etarfolatide (EC20), the challenges in proving survival advantage, and other approaches to exploiting FR as a target in ovarian cancer.

Vintafolide (EC145) is a folic acid-desacetylvinblastine conjugate that binds to the folate receptor (FR), which is expressed on the majority of epithelial ovarian cancers. This randomized phase II trial evaluated vintafolide combined with pegylated liposomal doxorubicin (PLD) compared with PLD alone. The utility of an FR-targeted imaging agent, (99m)Tc-etarfolatide (EC20), in selecting patients likely to benefit from vintafolide was also examined. Women with recurrent platinum-resistant ovarian cancer who had undergone ≤ two prior cytotoxic regimens were randomly assigned at a 2:1 ratio to PLD (50 mg/m(2) intravenously [IV] once every 28 days) with or without vintafolide (2.5 mg IV three times per week during weeks 1 and 3). Etarfolatide scanning was optional. The primary objective was to compare progression-free survival (PFS) between the groups. The intent-to-treat population comprised 149 patients. Median PFS was 5.0 and 2.7 months for the vintafolide plus PLD and PLD-alone arms, respectively (hazard ratio [HR], 0.63; 95% CI, 0.41 to 0.96; P = .031). The greatest benefit was observed in patients with 100% of lesions positive for FR, with median PFS of 5.5 compared with 1.5 months for PLD alone (HR, 0.38; 95% CI, 0.17 to 0.85; P = .013). The group of patients with FR-positive disease (10% to 90%) experienced some PFS improvement (HR, 0.873), whereas patients with disease that did not express FR experienced no PFS benefit (HR, 1.806). Vintafolide plus PLD is the first combination to demonstrate an improvement over standard therapy in a randomized trial of patients with platinum-resistant ovarian cancer. Etarfolatide can identify patients likely to benefit from vintafolide.
