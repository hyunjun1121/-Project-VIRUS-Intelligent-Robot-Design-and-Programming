What causes "Puffy hand syndrome"?

[PMID: 15529083]
Narcotic addiction may induce systemic and local complications. Intravenous injections of drugs can cause venous thrombosis, and septic or embolic complications. The puffy hand sign is a more uncommon complication of hard-core injection addicts. Three long-term intravenous drug users, two males, one female, mean age 30.6 years (26-37) presented puffy hands. These patients had been drug addicts for four to twelve years (mean duration 7.3 years) and had stopped heroin injections for 3-5 years (mean 4.6), participating in a buprenorphine substitution program. The edema appeared several years after drug cessation (1.5-5, mean 2.3). Typically the puffiness was bilateral, the hands swollen from the proximal segments of the fingers to the wrist. In one patient, the edema was localized both in the hands and in the feet. The edema was not pitting and unaffected by elevation. Duplex ultrasound examination of the extremities was normal. Lymphangiography performed in one patient was consistent with deep lymphatic destruction. Puffy hand syndrome appears to be the end result of lymphatic obstruction. Repeated injections of drugs in or outside the veins destroy the lymphatics. Buprenorphine may play an important role in the puffy hand sign. Although it is supposed to be administered orally, many drug addicts use it as an i.v. solution. Because buprenorphine is poorly soluble, it causes lymphatic obstruction. This type of hand for which no therapy exists must be differentiated from deep palmar space infection with dorsal edema which requires incision and drainage.

The incidence of vascular complications due to drug abuse is at present increasing due to new types of drugs and to the different ways of intake of such substances. The vascular complications related to drug abuse may affect venous, arterious and lymphatic districts and in particular: ischemia following intra-arterial injections, arterious and venous pseudoaneurysm, vasculitis, aneurysms, aortic dissections, abscesses complicated by erosions of vessels, arteriovenous fistulas, compartment syndrome, superficial and deep venous thrombosis, septic trombophlebitis, puffy hand syndrome. The scientific knowledge in this matter is incomplete because of the new pathological cases and the lack of information regarding the efficacy of different treatments. The authors report four patients affected by vascular pathologies due to drug abuse. In one case, a heroin addict has undergone multiple fasciotomies for compartimental syndrome arising because the patient maintained an innatural posture for several hours during an overdose coma. In a second case, a segmental right subclavear deep venous thrombosis has been treated by pharmacological therapy with satisfactory functional recovery of the arm. A third patient has been successfully submitted to intra-arterial pharmacological vasodilatation for generalised lower limbs vasospasm caused by drug abuse. In the last case, the voluntary swallowing of a great dose of cocaine caused the patient's death after multiple ischemic and hemorrhagic cerebral episodes. After the description of these cases, a review of the recent literature and some observations on this topic are presented. A better knowledge of vascular complications due to drug abuse should improve the therapeutical approach of these patients.

Infections generally occur in intravenous drug abuse (IVDA) patients, most commonly affecting the spine and proximal joints. Numerous serious musculoskeletal complications of IVDA may involve the upper extremity, however. Soft-tissue complications in the upper extremity of IVDA patients include cellulitis, ulceration, abscess, pyomyositis, septic bursitis, tenosynovitis, and necrotizing fasciitis. Foreign bodies in soft tissue due to needle fragments are common findings. Primary bone and joint IVDA complications include osteomyelitis (acute and chronic) and septic arthritis. Other IVDA complications in the upper extremity affecting blood vessels and lymphatics include hematoma, arterial aneurysm and pseudoaneurysm, thrombosis, thrombophlebitis, "puffy hand" syndrome, and lymphadenopathy. These complications usually present as urgent issues requiring prompt and accurate evaluation in the acute setting. Diagnostic imaging not only aids in making the correct diagnosis but also permits precise definition of the location and extent of these abnormalities. We review the imaging findings and illustrate a wide range of disabling and even life-threatening complications affecting the upper extremity of IVDA patients that require early diagnosis for optimal outcome.

The authors report an original clinical presentation of factitious disorders of the upper extremity in an ex-drug-addict patient with puffy hand syndrome. Chronic self-inflicted ulcerations appeared with sequential manner. The patient confessed deliberate self-harm and transfer of anxiety on his hands, the aspect of which had become intolerable. Association of puffy hand syndrome with comorbid psychosis and major depression explained immediate recurrence of ulcerations despite fitted medication and long-term psychotherapy.

Puffy hand syndrome is an unrecognized complication of intravenous drug abuse. This painless syndrome appears during or after a long period of drug addiction. It involves the hands and sometimes the forearms, and may cause functional, aesthetic and social disturbances when the hand volume is important. Physiopathological mechanisms of the puffy hand syndrome are unclear and include venous and lymphatic insufficiencies, infectious complications and direct toxicity of injected drugs and their adulterants. Low-stretch bandage and elastic garment, usually used in lymphedema treatment, are proposed to treat the puffy hand syndrome.

Puffy hand syndrome is a complication of intravenous drug abuse, which has no current available treatment. Arm and forearm edema are voluminous and cause functional and aesthetic disturbances. We report two cases successfully treated by low-stretch bandages. A 40-year-old man and a 34-year-old woman, both intravenous drug users, with puffy hand syndrome were hospitalized for 11 days. Treatment included daily multilayer bandaging. Lymphedema volumes calculated by utilizing the formula for a truncated cone decreased by 16% on the left side and 12% on the right side for the first patient and 31 and 17% for the second. Hand circumference decreased 4.3 cm on the left side and 3.2 cm on the right side in case 1, and 2.5 cm and 1.9 cm respectively for case 2. The patients were taught self-bandaging techniques during their hospital stays. Elastic gloves were fitted at the end of treatment. Reduction of lymphedema volume remained stable after 18 months in one patient while for the second patient further treatment and hospitalization were required due to poor compliance. The pathogenesis of this edema is probably multifactorial: venous, lymphatic insufficiency and the direct toxicity of injected drugs. Lymphedema treatment currently consists of low-stretch bandaging and wearing elastic garments, which is effective in decreasing the volume of puffy hand syndrome.

Intravenous drug addiction is responsible for many complications, especially cutaneous and infectious. There is a syndrome, rarely observed in rheumatology, resulting in "puffy hands": the puffy hand syndrome. We report two cases of this condition from our rheumatologic consultation. Our two patients had intravenous drug addiction. They presented with an edema of the hands, bilateral, painless, no pitting, occurring in one of our patient during heroin intoxication, and in the other 2 years after stopping injections. In our two patients, additional investigations (biological, radiological, ultrasound) were unremarkable, which helped us, in the context, to put the diagnosis of puffy hand syndrome. The pathophysiology, still unclear, is based in part on a lymphatic toxicity of drugs and their excipients. There is no etiological treatment but elastic compression by night has improved edema of the hands in one of our patients.

We studied the pathogenesis of puffy hand syndrome of intravenous drug use. We hypothesized that injections of high-dose sublingual buprenorphine, instead of the recommended sublingual administration, could play an important role in lymphatic obstruction and destruction. We set up a case-control study in substitution centres, recruiting intravenous drug addicts with and without puffy hands, respectively. The subjects were asked to answer anonymously a questionnaire of 40 items comprising social and demographic status, history of illicit drugs use, buprenorphine misuse and injection practices. We included 33 cases and 33 controls, mean age of 34 years. They were past heroin users, mainly methadone-substituted. In multivariate analysis, sex (women) (OR = 8.9, P = 0.03), injections in the hands (OR = 5.9, P = 0.03), injections in the feet (OR = 6.5, P = 0.01) and the absence of tourniquet (OR = 7.0, p = 0.02) were significant risk factors for puffy hand syndrome. In 69.7% of the cases and 59.4% of the controls, respectively, there was a high-dose sublingual buprenorphine misuse, although it appeared not to be a significant risk factor for puffy hand syndrome. Injection practices are likely to cause puffy hands syndrome, but buprenorphine misuse should not be considered as a significant risk factor. However, intravenous drug users must still be warned of local and systemic complications of intravenous drug misuse.

Puffy hand syndrome develops after long-term intravenous drug addiction. It is characterized by a nonpitting edema, affecting the dorsal side of fingers and hands with puffy aspect. Frequency and severity of the complications of this syndrome are rarely reported. Local infectious complications such as cellulitis can be severe and can enable the diagnosis. Herein, we report the case of a 41-year-old man who went to the emergency department for abdominal pain, fever, and bullous lesions of legs and arms with edema. Bacteriologic examination of a closed bullous lesion evidenced a methicillin sensitive Staphylococcus aureus. The abdomen computed tomography excluded deep infections and peritoneal effusion. The patient was successfully treated by intravenous oxacillin and clindamycin. He had a previous history of intravenous heroin addiction. We retained the diagnosis of puffy hand syndrome revealed by a severe staphylococcal infection with toxic involvement mimicking a four limbs cellulitis. Puffy hand syndrome, apart from the chronic lymphedema treatment, has no specific medication available. Prophylactic measures against skin infections are essential.
