IDEAL_ANSWER:
- Mutations in the VPS4A gene, which encodes the alpha-subunit of the lysosomal sorting enzyme, beta-N-acetylhexosaminidase 4, are the cause of multisystem disease type 4 or Ferroportin disease.
- De novo mutations in the gene encoding for endosomal sorting enzyme VPS4A (Val4A) cause multisystem disease
- De Î½ovo VPS4A mutations cause multisystem disease with abnormal neurodevelopment.

EXACT_ANSWER:
- Multisystem disease with abnormal neurodevelopment
