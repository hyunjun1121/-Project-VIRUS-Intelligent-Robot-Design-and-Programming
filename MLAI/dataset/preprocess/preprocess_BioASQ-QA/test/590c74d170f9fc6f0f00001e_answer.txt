IDEAL_ANSWER:
- the related transcription factors Ecm22 and Upc2 play a crucial role in Saccharomyces cerevisiae filamentation.
- Here, we examine the role of the related transcription factors Ecm22 and Upc2 in Saccharomyces cerevisiae filamentation. The zinc cluster proteins Upc2 and Ecm22 promote filamentation in Saccharomyces cerevisiae by sterol biosynthesis-dependent and -independent pathways.
