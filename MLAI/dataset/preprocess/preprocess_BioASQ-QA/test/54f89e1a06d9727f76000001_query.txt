To investigate the effects of KN-93, a CaMKII selective inhibitor on cell proliferation and the expression of p53 or p21 protein in human hepatic stellate cells. Human hepatic stellate cells (LX-2) were incubated with various concentrations (0-50 micromol/L) of KN-93 or its inactive derivative, KN-92. Cell proliferation was measured by CCK-8 assay, and the expression of two cell cycle regulators, p53 and p21, was determined by SDS-PAGE and Western blotting. KN-93 (5-50 micromol/L) decreased the proliferation of human hepatic stellate cells in a dose-dependent manner from 81.76% (81.76% +/- 2.58% vs 96.63% +/- 2.69%, P < 0.05) to 27.15% (27.15% +/- 2.86% vs 96.59% +/- 2.44%, P < 0.01) after 24 h treatment. Incubation of 10 micromol/L KN-93 induced the cell growth reduction in a time-dependent manner from 78.27% at 8 h to 11.48% at 48 h. However, KN-92, an inactive derivative of KN-93, did not inhibit cell proliferation effectively. Moreover, analysis of cell cycle regulator expression revealed that KN-93 rather than KN-92 reduced the expression of p53 and p21. KN-93 has potent inhibitory effect on proliferation of LX-2 cells by modulating the expression of two special cell cycle regulators, p53 and p21.

The antennal lobe (primary olfactory center of insects) is completely reorganized during metamorphosis. This reorganization is accompanied by changing patterns of calcium signaling in neurons and glial cells. In the present study, we investigated the developmental distribution of a major calcium-dependent protein, viz., calcium/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II (CaM kinase II), in the antennal lobe of the sphinx moth Manduca sexta by using a monoclonal antibody. During synaptogenesis (developmental stages 6-10), we found a redistribution of CaM kinase II immunoreactivity, from a homogeneous distribution in the immature neuropil to an accumulation in the neuropil of the glomeruli. CaM kinase II immunoreactivity was less intense in olfactory receptor axons of the antennal nerve and antennal lobe glial cells. Western blot analysis revealed a growing content of CaM kinase II in antennal lobe tissue throughout metamorphosis. Injection of the CaM kinase inhibitor KN-93 into pupae resulted in a reduced number of antennal lobe glial cells migrating into the neuropil to form borders around glomeruli. The results suggest that CaM kinase II is involved in glial cell migration.

ATP, a purinergic receptor agonist, has been shown to be involved in vascular smooth muscle (VSM) cell DNA synthesis and cell proliferation during embryonic and postnatal development, after injury, and in atherosclerosis. One mechanism that ATP utilizes to regulate cellular function is through activation of ERK1/2. In the present study, we provide evidence that ATP-dependent activation of ERK1/2 in VSM cells utilizes specific isoforms of the multifunctional serine/threonine kinases, PKC, and Ca(2+)/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II (CaMKII) as intermediates. Selective inhibition of PKC-delta activity with rottlerin, or adenoviral overexpression of kinase-negative PKC-delta, attenuated the ATP- and phorbol 12,13-dibutyrate (PDBu)-stimulated ERK1/2 activation. Inhibition of PKC-alpha activity with GÃ¶-6976, or adenoviral overexpression of kinase-negative PKC-alpha, was ineffective. Alternatively, treatment with KN-93, a selective inhibitor of CaMKII activation, or adenoviral overexpression of kinase-negative CaMKII-delta(2), inhibited ATP-dependent activation of ERK1/2 but had no effect on PDBu- or PDGF-stimulated ERK1/2. In addition, adenoviral overexpression of dominant-negative ras (Ad.HA-Ras(N17)) partially inhibited the ATP- and PDBu-induced activation of ERK1/2 and blocked ionomycin- and EGF-stimulated ERK1/2, and inhibition of tyrosine kinases with AG-1478, an EGFR inhibitor, or the src family kinase inhibitor PP2 attenuated ATP-stimulated ERK1/2 activation. Taken together, these data indicate that PKC-delta and CaMKII-delta(2) coordinately mediate ATP-dependent transactivation of EGF receptor, resulting in increased ERK1/2 activity in VSM cells.

The multifunctional Ca++/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II (CaM kinase) mediates Ca++-induced augmentation of L-type Ca++ current (ICa); therefore it may act as a proarrhythmic signaling molecule during early afterdepolarizations (EADs) due to ICa. To investigate the hypothesis that ICa-dependent EADs are favored by CaM kinase activation EADs were induced with clofilium in isolated rabbit hearts. All EADs were rapidly terminated with ICa antagonists. Hearts were pretreated with the CaM kinase inhibitor KN-93 or the inactive analog KN-92 (0.5 microM) for 10 min before clofilium exposure. EADs were significantly suppressed by KN-93 (EADs present in 4/10 hearts) compared to KN-92 (EADs present in 10/11 hearts) (P =.024). There were no significant differences in parameters favoring EADs such as monophasic action potential duration or heart rate in KN-93- or KN-92-treated hearts. CaM kinase activity in situ increased 37% in hearts with EADs compared to hearts without EADs (P =.015). This increase in CaM kinase activity was prevented by pretreatment with KN-93. In vitro, KN-93 potently inhibited rabbit myocardial CaM kinase activity (calculated Ki </= 2.58 microM), but the inactive analog KN-92 did not (Ki > 100 microM). The actions of KN-93 and KN-92 on ICa and other repolarizing K+ currents did not explain preferential EAD suppression by KN-93. These data show a novel association between CaM kinase activation and EADs and are consistent with the hypothesis that the ICa and CaM kinase activation both contribute to EADs in this model.

Ca(+)/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II (CaM kinase II) has been implicated in the regulation of smooth muscle contractility. The goals of this study were to determine: 1) to what extent CaM kinase II is activated by contractile stimuli in intact arterial smooth muscle, and 2) the effect of a CaM kinase II inhibitor (KN-93) on CaM kinase II activation, phosphorylation of myosin regulatory light chains (MLC(20)), and force. Both histamine (1 microM) and KCl depolarization activated CaM kinase II with a time course preceding maximal force development, and suprabasal CaM kinase II activation was sustained during tonic contractions. CaM kinase II activation was inhibited by KN-93 pretreatment (IC(50) approximately 1 microM). KN-93 inhibited histamine-induced tonic force maintenance, whereas early force development and MLC(20) phosphorylation responses during the entire time course were unaffected. Both force development and maintenance in response to KCl were inhibited by KN-93. Rapid increases in KCl-induced MLC(20) phosphorylation were also inhibited by KN-93, whereas steady-state MLC(20) phosphorylation responses were unaffected. In contrast, phorbol 12,13-dibutyrate (PDBu) did not activate CaM kinase II and PDBu-stimulated force development was unaffected by KN-93. Thus KN-93 appears to target a step(s) essential for force maintenance in response to physiological stimuli, suggesting a role for CaM kinase II in regulating tonic contractile responses in arterial smooth muscle. Pharmacological activation of protein kinase C bypasses the KN-93 sensitive step.

KN-93, a membrane-permeant calcium/calmodulin- dependent kinase-selective inhibitor, induces apoptosis in some lines of human tumor cells. We investigated the effect of KN-93 in the choriocarcinoma cell line, BeWo. BeWo cells were treated with various concentrations of KN-93, and changes in cell growth, the cell cycle, apoptosis, and related parameters were examined. A WST-1 assay showed that BeWo cells were sensitive to the growth inhibitory effect of KN-93. Cell cycle analysis indicated that exposure to KN-93 decreased the proportion of cells in the S phase and increased the proportion in the G0/G1 phases of the cell cycle. Induction of apoptosis was confirmed by Annexin V staining of externalized phosphatidylserine, by the loss of mitochondrial transmembrane potential, and by antibodies directed against histones from fragmented DNA. This induction occurred in conjunction with the altered expression of genes related to cell growth, malignant phenotype, and apoptosis. These results suggest that KN-93 may serve as a therapeutic agent for the treatment of choriocarcinoma.

Once ingested by mosquitoes, malaria parasites undergo complex cellular changes. These include zygote formation, transformation of zygote to ookinete, and differentiation from ookinete to oocyst. Within the oocyst, the parasite multiplies into numerous sporozoites. Modulators of intracellular calcium homeostasis, MAPTAM, and TMB-8 blocked ookinete development as did the calmodulin (CaM) antagonists W-7 and calmidazolium. Ca(2+)/CaM-dependent protein kinase inhibitor KN-93 also blocked zygote elongation, while its ineffective analog KN-92 did not have such effect. In vitro both zygote and ookinete extracts efficiently phosphorylated autocamtide-2, a classic CaM kinase substrate, which could be blocked by calmodulin antagonists W-7 and calmidazolium and CaM kinase inhibitor KN-93. These results demonstrated the presence of calmodulin-dependent CaM kinase activity in the parasite. KN-93-treated parasites, however, expressed the ookinete-specific enzyme chitinase and the ookinete surface antigen Pgs28 normally, suggesting that the morphologically untransformed parasites are biochemically mature ookinetes. In mosquitoes, KN-93-treated parasites did not develop as oocysts, while KN-92-treated parasites produced similar numbers of oocysts as controls. These data suggested that in Plasmodium gallinaceum morphological development of zygote to ookinete, but not its biochemical maturation, relies on Ca(2+)/CaM-dependent protein kinase activity and demonstrated that the morphological differentiation is essential for the further development of the parasite in infected blood-fed mosquitoes.

We previously demonstrated that stimulation of human T-lymphocytes with calcium ionophores induced the phosphorylation and enzymatic activation of ERK2. We now report on the mechanism by which calcium-ionophore-induced activation of ERK1 and 2 occurs in these cells. The activation of ERK1 and 2 by increases in intracellular calcium was inhibited by calmidazolium suggesting the involvement of calmodulin in this response. To further elucidate the mechanism by which calcium-induced ERK activation occurs, we used the CaM-kinase inhibitor KN-93 and an inactive analog of KN-93 (KN-92). KN-93, but not KN-92, blocked ionomycin-induced activation of ERK1 and 2 in human T lymphocytes. We previously demonstrated that stimulation of T lymphocytes with ionomycin or A23187 resulted in a CaM-kinase-dependent shift in the mobility of p56(Lck). To determine if p56(Lck) was involved in calcium-induced ERK activation, we stimulated the p56(Lck) negative Jurkat cell derivatives, J.CaM1.6 and J.CaM1/Rep3, with ionomycin. In these p56(Lck) negative cell lines, activation of ERK1 and 2 in response to ionomycin was only minimally detected. When J.CaM1 cells were reconstituted with p56(Lck), ionomycin induced ERK1 and 2 activation. Treatment of Jurkat cells with PP2, an inhibitor of p56(Lck), inhibited calcium-induced, but not PMA-induced, ERK1 and 2 activation. Treatment of Jurkat cells with the MEK inhibitor PD98059 blocked ionomycin-induced ERK activation, but not the shift in the mobility of p56(Lck). Our data suggests that increases in intracellular calcium induce the activation of ERK1 and 2 in human T lymphocytes via sequential activation of CaM-kinase and phosphorylation of p56(Lck).

We previously demonstrated a loss in Ca(2+)/Calmodulin-dependent protein kinase (CaM kinase) activity in SH-SY5Y undergoing thapsigargin-mediated apoptosis. To extend that finding we report that CaM kinase inhibition potentiates thapsigargin-mediated cell death. CaM kinase inhibitor KN93 on its own exhibits little toxicity up to 10 mM, as measured by release of lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) into the culture medium. In SH-SY5Y cells pretreated with KN93 and the non-selective protein kinase inhibitor k252a and then treated with 2 mM thapsigargin, loss of viability is significantly greater than in cells treated with thapsigargin alone. Pretreatment with the pan-caspase inhibitor Z-D-DCB prevented the thapsigargin-mediated increase in LDH release. Furthermore, thapsigargin-induced caspase-3-like activation, demonstrated by poly(ADP)ribose polymerase cleavage and pro-caspase-3 processing, was elevated in the presence of KN93.

A novel Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II (CaM Kinase II) inhibitor, KN-93 potently inhibits gastric acid secretion from parietal cells. As previously reported (1), treatment of parietal cells with a selective inhibitor of CaM kinase II, KN-62 resulted in the inhibition of cholinergic-stimulated rabbit parietal cell secretion, whereas it failed to inhibit the histamine and forskolin response. In contrast effects of carbachol, histamine and forskolin were significantly inhibited by KN-93 with an IC50 of 0.15, 0.3 and 1 microM, respectively; these effects occurred without any changes in intracellular cyclic AMP and Ca2+ levels. In the present study we investigated the mechanism by which KN-93 acts upon the acid-secreting machinery of gastric parietal cells. Neither redistribution of the proton pump activity nor the morphological transformation were affected by KN-93. The drug only weakly inhibited the H+, K(+)-ATPase activity but strongly dissipated the proton gradient formed in the gastric membrane vesicles and reduced the volume of luminal space. Thus KN-93 acts at pH gradient formation whereas KN-62 acts only at CaM Kinase II.

We have investigated the contribution of Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II (CaM kinase II) and mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAP kinase) in norepinephrine (NE)-induced arachidonic acid (AA) release in rabbit aortic vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMC). NE enhanced release of AA via activation of cytosolic phospholipase A2 (cPLA2) but not secretory PLA2 in VSMC prelabeled with [3H]AA. NE (10 microM) enhanced CaM kinase II and MAP kinase activity. In cells transiently transfected with antisense oligonucleotides complementary to the translation initiation sites of CaM kinase II and MAP kinase, NE-induced AA release was inhibited by 100 and 35% respectively. Treatment of cells with PD-098059, a MAP kinase kinase inhibitor, or with MAP kinase antisense oligonucleotide reduced NE-induced activation of MAP kinase and cPLA2. NE-induced MAP kinase and cPLA2 activation was also inhibited in cells treated with a CaM kinase II inhibitor, KN-93, or with CaM kinase II antisense oligonucleotide. On the other hand, inhibition of MAP kinase kinase with PD-098059 or of MAP kinase with antisense oligonucleotides did not alter the NE-induced increase in CaM kinase II activity. Phosphorylation of MAP kinase and CaM kinase II by NE, studied by 32P incorporation and immune complex kinase assays, was inhibited by KN-93. Collectively, these data suggest that CaM kinase II can activate MAP kinase, which in turn activates cPLA2 to release AA for prostacyclin synthesis in the rabbit VSMC. This novel pathway for activation of MAP kinase by CaM kinase II appears to be mediated through stimulation of MAP kinase kinase. Activation of adrenergic receptors with NE in VSMC caused translocation of CaM kinase II, MAP kinase, and cPLA2 to the nuclear envelope only in the presence of extracellular Ca2+. Okadaic acid, which increased phosphorylation and activity, did not translocate these enzymes. Therefore, it appears that in rabbit VSMC, NE, by promoting extracellular Ca2+ influx, increases CaM kinase II activity, leading to activation of MAP kinase and cPLA2 and translocation to the nuclear envelope, resulting in release of AA from the nuclear envelope for prostacyclin synthesis.

Prolonged AMPA-receptor blockade in hippocampal neuron cultures leads to both an increased expression of GluA1 postsynaptically and an increase in vesicle pool size and turnover rate presynaptically, adaptive changes that extend beyond simple synaptic scaling. As a molecular correlate, expression of the Î² Ca(2+)/CaM-dependent kinase type II (Î²CaMKII) is increased in response to synaptic inactivity. Here we set out to clarify the role of Î²CaMKII in the various manifestations of adaptation. Knockdown of Î²CaMKII by lentiviral-mediated expression of shRNA prevented the synaptic inactivity-induced increase in GluA1, as did treatment with the CaM kinase inhibitor KN-93, but not the inactive analog KN-92. These results demonstrate that, spurred by AMPA-receptor blockade, up-regulation of Î²CaMKII promotes increased GluA1 expression. Indeed, transfection of Î²CaMKII, but not a kinase-dead mutant, increased GluA1 expression on dendrites and elevated vesicle turnover (Syt-Ab uptake), mimicking the effect of synaptic inactivity on both sides of the synapse. In cells with elevated Î²CaMKII, relief of synaptic-activity blockade uncovered an increase in the frequency of miniature excitatory postsynaptic currents that could be rapidly and fully suppressed by PhTx blockade of GluA1 receptors. This increased mini frequency involved a genuine presynaptic enhancement, not merely an increased abundance of synapses. This finding suggests that Ca(2+) flux through GluA1 receptors may trigger the acute release of a retrograde messenger. Taken together, our results indicate that synaptic inactivity-induced increases in Î²CaMKII expression set in motion a series of events that culminate in coordinated pre- and postsynaptic adaptations in synaptic transmission.

The calmodulin-dependent protein kinase-II (CaMK-II) inhibitor KN-93 has been shown to reversibly arrest mouse and human cells in the G1 phase of the cell cycle [Tombes, R. M., Westin, E., Grant. S., and Krystal, G. (1995) Cell Growth Differ. 6, 1073-1070; Rasmussen, G., and Rasmussen, C. (1995) Biochem. Cell Biol. 71, 201-207]. The stimulation of Ca(2+)-independent (autonomous) CaMK-II enzymatic activity, a barometer of in situ activated CaMK-II, was prevented by the same KN-93 concentrations that cause G1 phase arrest. KN-93 caused the retinoblastoma protein pRB to become dephosphorylated and the activity of both cdk2 and cdk4, two potential pRb kinases, to decrease. Neither the activity of p42MAP kinase, an early response G1 signaling molecule, nor the phosphorylation status or DNA-binding capability of the transcription factors serum response factor and cAMP responsive element-binding protein was altered during this G1 arrest. The protein levels of cyclin-dependent kinase 2 (cdk2) and cdk4 were unaffected during this G1 arrest and the total cellular levels of the cdk inhibitors p21cip1 and p27kip1 were not increased. Instead, the cdk4 activity decreases resulting from KN-93 were the result of a 75% decrease in cyclin D1 levels. In contrast, cyclin A and E levels were relatively constant. Cdk2 activity decreases were primarily the result of enhanced p27kip1 association with cdk2/cyclin E. All of these phenomena were unaffected by KN-93's inactive analog, KN-92, and were reversible upon KN-93 washout. The kinetics of recovery from cell cycle arrest were similar to those reported for other G1 phase blockers. These results suggest a mechanism by which G1 Ca2+ signals could be linked via calmodulin-dependent phosphorylations to the cell cycle-controlling machinery through cyclins and cdk inhibitors.

Phosphorylation of cytoplasmic polyadenylation element binding protein (CPEB) regulates protein synthesis in hippocampal dendrites. CPEB binds the 3' untranslated region (UTR) of cytoplasmic mRNAs and, when phosphorylated, initiates mRNA polyadenylation and translation. We report that, of the protein kinases activated in the hippocampus during synaptic plasticity, calcium/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II (CaMKII) robustly phosphorylated the regulatory site (threonine 171) in CPEB in vitro. In postsynaptic density fractions or hippocampal neurons, CPEB phosphorylation increased when CaMKII was activated. These increases in CPEB phosphorylation were attenuated by a specific peptide inhibitor of CaMKII and by the general CaM-kinase inhibitor KN-93. Inhibitors of protein phosphatase 1 increased basal CPEB phosphorylation in neurons; this was also attenuated by a CaM-kinase inhibitor. To determine whether CaM-kinase activity regulates CPEB-dependent mRNA translation, hippocampal neurons were transfected with luciferase fused to a 3' UTR containing CPE-binding elements. Depolarization of neurons stimulated synthesis of luciferase; this was abrogated by inhibitors of protein synthesis, mRNA polyadenylation, and CaMKII. These results demonstrate that CPEB phosphorylation and translation are regulated by CaMKII activity and provide a possible mechanism for how dendritic protein synthesis in the hippocampus may be stimulated during synaptic plasticity.

Intermittent hypoxia (IH) occurs in many pathological conditions. However, very little is known about the molecular mechanisms associated with IH. Hypoxia-inducible factor 1 (HIF-1) mediates transcriptional responses to continuous hypoxia. In the present study, we investigated whether IH activates HIF-1 and, if so, which signaling pathways are involved. PC12 cells were exposed to either to 20% O2 (non-hypoxic control) or to 60 cycles consisting of 30 s at 1.5% O2, followed by 4 min at 20% O2 (IH). Western blot analysis revealed significant increases in HIF-1alpha protein in nuclear extracts of cells subjected to IH. Expression of a HIF-1-dependent reporter gene was increased 3-fold in cells subjected to IH. Although IH induced the activation of ERK1, ERK2, JNK, PKC-alpha, and PKC-gamma, inhibitors of these kinases and of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase did not block HIF-1-mediated reporter gene expression induced by IH, indicating that signaling via these kinases was not required. In contrast, addition of the intracellular Ca2+ chelator BAPTA-AM or the Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent (CaM) kinase inhibitor KN93 blocked reporter gene activation in response to IH. CaM kinase activity was increased 5-fold in cells subjected to IH. KN 93 prevented IH-induced transactivation mediated by HIF-1alpha, and its coactivator p300, which was phosphorylated by CaM kinase II in vitro. Expression of the HIF-1-regulated gene encoding tyrosine hydroxylase was induced by IH and this effect was blocked by KN93. These observations suggest that IH induces HIF-1 transcriptional activity via a novel signaling pathway involving CaM kinase.

We reported that one of the isoquinolinesulfonamide derivatives, KN-62, is a potent and specific inhibitor of Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II (CaMKII) (Tokumitsu, H., Chijiwa, T., Hagiwara, M., Mizutani, A., Terasawa, M. and Hidaka, H. (1990) J. Biol. Chem. 265, 4315-4320). We have now investigated the inhibitory property of a newly synthesized methoxybenzenesulfonamide, KN-93, on CaMKII activity in situ and in vitro. KN-93 elicited potent inhibitory effects on CaMKII phosphorylating activity with an inhibition constant of 0.37 microM but this compound had no significant effects on the catalytic activity of cAMP-dependent protein kinase, Ca2+/phospholipid dependent protein kinase, myosin light chain kinase and Ca(2+)-phosphodiesterase. KN-93 also inhibited the autophosphorylation of both the alpha- and beta-subunits of CaMKII. Kinetic analysis indicated that KN-93 inhibits CaMKII, in a competitive fashion against calmodulin. To evaluate the regulatory role of CaMKII on catecholamine metabolism, we examined the effect of KN-93 on dopamine (DA) levels in PC12h cells. The DA levels decreased in the presence of KN-93. Further, the tyrosine hydroxylase (TH) phosphorylation induced by KCl or acetylcholine was significantly suppressed by KN-93 in PC12h cells while events induced by forskolin or 8-Br-cAMP were not affected. These results suggest that KN-93 inhibits DA formation by modulating the reaction rate of TH to reduce the Ca(2+)-mediated phosphorylation levels of the TH molecule.
