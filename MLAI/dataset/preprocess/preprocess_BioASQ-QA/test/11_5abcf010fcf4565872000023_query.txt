What nerve is involved in carpal tunnel syndrome?

[PMID: 28718333]
Compression of the median nerve at the wrist, or carpal tunnel syndrome, is the most commonly recognized nerve entrapment syndrome. Carpal tunnel syndrome is usually caused by compression of the median nerve due to synovial swelling, tumor, or anomalous anatomical structure within the carpal tunnel. During a routine carpal tunnel decompression, a large vessel was identified within the carpal tunnel. The large vessel was the radial artery. It ran along the radial aspect of the carpal tunnel just adjacent to the median nerve. The unusual presence of the radial artery within the carpal tunnel could be a contributing factor to the development of carpal tunnel syndrome. In this case, after surgical carpal tunnel release, all symptoms of carpal tunnel syndrome resolved.

Carpal tunnel syndrome is a complex of symptoms as a result of compression of the median nerve in the carpal tunnel. As nerve entrapment induces impairment of somatic fibres followed by clinical symptoms and signs of the syndrome, one can assume that sympathetic fibres are involved too. Results of studies focused on this problem show presence of sympathetic symptoms in about half of patients, including Raynaud phenomenon, blanching of hands, painful swelling of fingers, dry or excessive sweating of palms. Activity of sympathetic system can be investigated by means of sympathetic skin response and vasomotor response. Eight papers presenting the results of sympathetic skin response from median nerve in carpal tunnel syndrome were analysed. Results of 4 studies showed decreased sympathetic activity, in 2 findings were equivocal and 2 studies failed to reveal any abnormalities. The following variables were considered in the interpretation of sympathetic skin response curve: amplitude, latency and area under the chart, each of them having limited diagnostic value due to inter-and intrasubject variation of these parameters. Vasomotor response was investigated in 2 studies by means of Doppler ultrasound flow examination in digital arteries. Results of both studies showed decreased vasomotor response in carpal tunnel syndrome. The review of current knowledge on sympathetic impairment in carpal tunnel syndrome fails to provide a definitive determination of its range and clinical consequences. It confirms, however, that routine examination of sympathetic disturbances is unnecessary due to their minor clinical significance.

Ultrasound is an established method of viewing the median nerve in the carpal tunnel syndrome (CTS). There is some evidence to suggest that immediate changes may occur in the median nerve before and after hand activity. The evidence for the validity and reliability of ultrasound for testing acute changes in the median nerve has not been systematically reviewed to date. To evaluate the evidence for visible change in ultrasound appearance of the median nerve after hand activity. A literature search was designed, and three reviewers independently selected published research for inclusion. Two reviewers independently appraised papers using the Evidence Based Library and Information Practice (EBLIP) appraisal checklist, while the third reviewer resolved discrepancies between appraisals. Ten studies were appraised and the results showed an increase in median nerve cross-sectional area following activity, with a return to normal size within 1 h following activity. Both healthy individuals and those diagnosed with CTS participated, all were small convenience samples. Ultrasonographic measurements of the median nerve were reliable in the four studies reporting this, and the studies demonstrated high quality. Good-quality evidence as identified by the EBLIP appraisal checklist suggests that following hand activity, the median nerve changes in size in the carpal tunnel. The results may not be generalizable to all people and activities due to the use of small convenience sampling and narrow range of activities studied, in all of the studies appraised.

The carpal tunnel syndrome is a neuropathy due to trapping (focal lesion of the peripheral nerve due to a local cause); in this case, the median nerve is the most commonly involved. Its presentation is characteristic in females about 40 years of age. The diagnosis is mainly based on clinical features and is confirmed by electrical criteria. In the anamnesis it is important to consider systemic diseases as causing the abnormality. Treatment depends on the etiology. It may be medical or surgical. In the present article we report three cases with different etiology and treatment. We also review the syndrome.

Motion of the median nerve was compared on an axial ultrasonographic image in the mid-carpal tunnel in 30 wrists of 15 women with bilateral idiopathic carpal tunnel syndrome and 30 wrists of 15 healthy women. During passive flexion and extension of the index finger, the control wrists had transverse sliding of the nerve beneath the flexor retinaculum (1.75 +/- 0.49 mm), which was regarded as a physiological phenomenon. In contrast, the wrists of patients with carpal tunnel syndrome had significantly less sliding (0.37 +/- 0.34 mm; P = 0.0001), which indicates that physiological motion of the nerve is restricted. This decrease in nerve mobility may be of significance in the pathophysiology of carpal tunnel syndrome.

Dear sir, one of the most common entrapment neuropathy syndromes in clinical practice is "Entrapment of median nerve in carpal tunnel" also called "Carpal tunnel syndrome (CTS)" (Aydin et al., 2007; Huisstede et al., 2010). This syndrome is caused by entrapment of the median nerve in the wrist (Preston and Shapiro, 2005) when the pressure increases in the carpal tunnel. A high division of the median nerve proximal to the carpal tunnel, also known as a bifid median nerve, is a rare anatomic variation that may be associated with CTS and with persistent median vessels (Lanz, 1977). This anatomic variation has an incidence of 0,8% to 2,3% in patients with CTS. Lanz (1977) has characterized this anatomic condition of the median nerve in the carpal tunnel. These anatomic variants have been classified into four groups: - Group 0: extraligamentous thenar branch (standard anatomy); - Group 1: variations of the course of the thenar branch; - Group 2: accessory branches at the distal portion of the carpal tunnel; - Group 3: divided or duplicated median nerve inside the carpal tunnel; - Group 4: accessory branches proximal to the carpal tunnel. During dissection of the wrist performed for the treatment of a CTS under local anesthesia, we found an anatomical variation of the median nerve that was divided in two branches inside the carpal tunnel (Group 3 of Lanz Classification) and in which its radial branch passed through its own compartment. The two parts of the nerve seems to be unequal in size (Fig. 1). Moreover the nerve passed in carpal tunnel associated with a median artery, so we classified this variation in the group 3b of Lanz Classification (Fig. 2). The persistence of median artery coexisting with a bifid median nerve has been widely reported in surgical literature (Lanz, 1977; Barbe et al., 2005). Before surgical intervention clinical evaluation of patient and electrophysiological examination showed no differences compared to a non bifid median nerve entrapment syndrome. In conclusion the bifid median nerve may facilitate compression of median nerve in the carpal tunnel because of its increased cross sectional area even if it has no electrophysiological or clinical differential diagnosis in case of CTS. The aim of this letter is aware the physicians in order to borne in mind the possible presence of a median nerve variation during dissection of carpal tunnel in order to avoid the damage of this non common anatomical structures.

To define the relationship between body indices of healthy adults and cross-sectional areas of the carpal tunnel and median nerve and to obtain the nerve/tunnel index, which represents a new standard for diagnosing carpal tunnel syndrome using sonography. Body indices (height, weight, and body mass index) were analyzed in 60 healthy adults, and electromyography and sonography were also performed. The cross-sectional areas of the proximal and distal median nerve and carpal tunnel were obtained by sonography. The proximal and distal nerve/tunnel indices were obtained by calculating the ratio between the proximal and distal cross-sectional areas of the median nerve to those of the carpal tunnel and multiplying the value by 100. Although the proximal cross-sectional areas of the median nerve and body indices showed statistically significant relationships with weak positive correlations, the proximal and distal areas of the carpal tunnel showed relatively stronger correlations with body indices. Between sexes, there were significant differences in the proximal median nerve cross-sectional area (mean ± SD: male, 10.48 ± 3.21 mm(2); female, 8.81 ± 3.21 mm(2); P < .05) and proximal carpal tunnel area (male, 182.50 ± 21.15 mm(2); female, 151.23 ± 21.14 mm(2); P < .05). There was no difference in the proximal nerve/tunnel index (male, 5.80% ± 1.72%; female, 5.91% ± 1.63%). There was a statistically significant difference in the distal carpal tunnel cross-sectional area (male, 138.90 ± 20.95 mm(2); female, 121.50 ± 18.99 mm(2); P < .05) between sexes, but the distal median area (male, 9.99 ± 3.42 mm(2); female, 8.46 ± 1.84 mm(2)) and distal nerve/tunnel index (male, 7.15% ± 2.00%; female, 7.01% ± 1.38%) showed no significant differences. The proximal index was significantly higher than the distal index (proximal, 5.85% ± 1.66%; distal, 7.08% ± 1.71%). The nerve/tunnel index is unaffected by body indices or sex and thus may be a useful and objective standard for diagnosing carpal tunnel syndrome.

Although ultrasound measurements have been used in previous studies on carpal tunnel syndrome to visualize injury to the median nerve, whether such ultrasound data can indicate the severity of carpal tunnel syndrome remains controversial. The cross-sectional areas of the median nerve at the tunnel inlet and outlet can show swelling and compression of the nerve at the carpal. We hypothesized that the ratio of the cross-sectional areas of the median nerve at the carpal tunnel inlet to outlet accurately reflects the severity of carpal tunnel syndrome. To test this, high-resolution ultrasound with a linear array transducer at 5-17 MHz was used to assess 77 patients with carpal tunnel syndrome. The results showed that the cut-off point for the inlet-to-outlet ratio was 1.14. Significant differences in the inlet-to-outlet ratio were found among patients with mild, moderate, and severe carpal tunnel syndrome. The cut-off point in the ratio of cross-sectional areas of the median nerve was 1.29 between mild and more severe (moderate and severe) carpal tunnel syndrome patients with 64.7% sensitivity and 72.7% specificity. The cut-off point in the ratio of cross-sectional areas of the median nerve was 1.52 between the moderate and severe carpal tunnel syndrome patients with 80.0% sensitivity and 64.7% specificity. These results suggest that the inlet-to-outlet ratio reflected the severity of carpal tunnel syndrome.

Carpal tunnel syndrome (CTS) is a focal compressive neuropathy of the median nerve at the level of the wrist. CTS is the most common type of compressive neuropathy that occurs in the upper extremity. Typically, patients with CTS have paresthesia, pain, and numbness in the radial three and one-half digits. Nighttime symptoms are more common earlier in the disease process, with daytime symptoms becoming more frequent as CTS progresses. Electrodiagnostic studies may be performed to confirm a diagnosis of CTS or to obtain a baseline before surgical treatment; however, electrodiagnostic studies may be normal in a subset of patients who have CTS. Patients who have mild CTS should undergo an initial trial of nonsurgical treatment that includes lifestyle modifications, nighttime splinting, and corticosteroid injections. Carpal tunnel release should be performed in patients in whom nonsurgical treatment fails and patients who have acute CTS secondary to infection or trauma or have advanced symptoms. Recalcitrant CTS, which may occur in as many as 25% of patients who undergo carpal tunnel release, most commonly results from an incomplete transverse carpal ligament release or an incorrect initial diagnosis. Patients with recurrent symptoms often have perineural fibrosis that tethers the median nerve.

In this study, it was aimed to determine whether median nerve epineurectomy is beneficial in the surgical management of carpal tunnel syndrome (CTS). The study enrolled 72 patients including 34 patients without epineurectomy (Group A) and 38 patients with epineurectomy (Group B). Surgery was performed in patients with severe electrodiagnostic CTS findings, CTS duration >1 year and flattening along with hypervascularization in median nerve. All patients were assessed by visual analog scale, two-point discrimination test as well as subjective and objective findings at baseline and on the months 1, 3, and 6 after surgery. The mean age was 58.3 years (42-75 years) in 38 patients who underwent an epineurectomy, whereas it was 61.5 years (41-82 years) in 34 patients who did not have an epineurectomy. The groups were similar with regard to age, gender, duration of symptoms, and preoperative physical findings. Mean visual analog scale (VAS) scores were 1.7 in Group A and 1.8 in Group B. Again, these differences were not significant, on physical examination, the average two-point discrimination in the distribution of the median nerve was 4.9 mm (range: 3-11 mm) in Group A and 5.3 mm (range: 3-10 mm) in Group B. In postoperative evaluations, there was a better improvement in visual analog scale scores, two-point discrimination test and subjective symptoms including dysesthesia, pain and nocturnal pain within first 3 months; however, there was no marked difference in objective and subjective findings on the 6th month. No complication or recurrence was observed. We believe that median nerve epineurectomy is unnecessary in the surgical management of primary CTS since it has no influence on the midterm outcomes.

Carpal tunnel syndrome (CTS) is the most common median nerve neuropathy, accounting for 90% of all neuropathies. Carpal tunnel syndrome presents in 3.8% of the general population, with a higher prevalence among women. There are several risk factors associated with CTS, including both medical and non medical factors. The pathophysiologic mechanisms involved in the median nerve compression and traction are thought to be complex, and as yet are not fully understood. The present review aimed to provide an overview of the pathophysiology of median nerve neuropathy in the carpal tunnel, and subsequent development of CTS.
