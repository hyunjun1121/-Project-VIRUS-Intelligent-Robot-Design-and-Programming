BACKGROUND: The aim of this article was to evaluate the prognostic value of the MammaPrint(TM) signature in women $$ 60 years with invasive breast cancer. PATIENTS AND METHODS: 60 female patients were included in this prospective study. Eligibility criteria included: pT1c-3, pN0-1a, grade 2/3, hormone receptor-positive and HER2-negative tumor. The clinical risk was determined by Adjuvant! Online (AOL). RESULTS: 38 patients (63%) where considered to be low-risk patients by the 70-gene signature, while 22 (37%) were considered to be high-risk patients. No statistically significant differences between low- and high-risk groups could be detected for conventional prognostic parameters, particularly not for Ki-67. By AOL, 33 patients (55%) were considered to be at high risk, of which 20 had a discordant MammaPrint(TM) result. The discordance rate between the profile and AOL was 48%, which is higher than in previous publications. When the 70-gene signature was used in combination with the clinical risk assessment, the recommendation for adjuvant systemic treatment differed in 11 patients (18%). CONCLUSIONS: In the intermediate-risk subgroup, the 70-gene signature could be useful to decide in elderly patients whether they may benefit from adjuvant chemotherapy or not. Conventional clinicopathological factors were not suitable for a prediction of the 70-gene signature results in these patients.

Mammographic screening and increased awareness has led to an increase in the detection of T1 breast tumors that are generally estimated as having low risk of recurrence after locoregional treatment. However, even small tumors can metastasize, which leaves us with the question for the necessity of adjuvant treatment. Therefore, additional prognostic markers are needed to tailor adjuvant systemic treatment for these relatively low-risk patients. The aim of our study was to evaluate the accuracy of the 70-gene MammaPrint signature in T1 breast cancer. We selected 964 patients from previously reported studies with pT1 tumors (<or=2 cm). Frozen tumor samples were hybridized on the 70-gene signature array at the time of the initial study and classified as having good prognosis or poor prognosis. The median follow-up was 7.1 years (range 0.2-25.2). The 10-year distant metastasis-free (DMFS) and breast cancer specific survival (BCSS) probabilities were 87% (SE 2%) and 91% (SE 2%), respectively, for the good prognosis-signature group (n = 525), and 72% (SE 3%) and 72% (SE 3%), respectively, for the poor prognosis-signature group (n = 439). The signature was an independent prognostic factor for BCSS at 10 years (multivariate hazard ratio [HR] 3.25 [95% confidence interval, CI, 1.92-5.51; P < .001]). Moreover, the 70-gene MammaPrint signature predicted DMFS at 10 years for 139 patients with pT1ab cancers (HR 3.45 [95% CI 1.04-11.50, P = .04]). The 70-gene MammaPrint signature is an independent prognostic factor in patients with pT1 tumors and can help to individualize adjuvant treatment recommendation in this increasing breast cancer population.

To evaluate the cost-effectiveness of 70-gene MammaPrint signature (Agendia Inc, Huntington Beach, CA) vs Adjuvant! Online software (AS) (http://www.adjuvantonline.com) in patients 60 years or younger with early-stage breast cancer. Cost-effectiveness and cost-utility analyses from a US payer perspective. A Markov model with 3 health states was constructed. In the base case model, risk classification and patient outcomes were based on a 70-gene signature validation study. Efficacy of chemotherapy was derived from a published meta-analysis of clinical trials. An alternative model using data from AS and from the Surveillance, Epidemiology and End Results registry was built to examine the external validity of the base case model. The incremental benefits, costs, and cost-effectiveness of treatment guided by 70-gene signature were calculated. In the base case model, 70-gene signature reclassified 29% of patients and spared 10% of patients from chemotherapy. Compared with the AS strategy, the 70-gene signature strategy was associated with $1440 higher total cost per patient and with 0.14 additional life-year or 0.15 additional quality-adjusted life-year. Overall, the incremental cost-effectiveness ratios were approximately $10,000 per life-year or quality-adjusted life-year in the base case model and $700 in the alternative model. The model results were sensitive to estrogen receptor status, the proportion of patients classified as high risk vs low risk, and the overall survival in each risk group. A 70-gene signature is likely to be a cost-effective strategy to guide adjuvant chemotherapy treatment in younger patients with early-stage breast cancer.

Constructive Technology Assessment (CTA) is a means to guide early implementation of new developments in society, and can be used as an evaluation tool for Coverage with Evidence Development (CED). We used CTA for the introduction of a new diagnostic test in the Netherlands, the 70-gene prognosis signature (MammaPrint) for node-negative breast cancer patients. Studied aspects were (organizational) efficiency, patient-centeredness and diffusion scenarios. Pre-post structured surveys were conducted in fifteen community hospitals concerning changes in logistics and teamwork as a consequence of the introduction of the 70-gene signature. Patient-centeredness was measured by questionnaires and interviews regarding knowledge and psychological impact of the test. Diffusion scenarios, which are commonly applied in industry to anticipate on future development and diffusion of their products, have been applied in this study. Median implementation-time of the 70-gene signature was 1.2 months. Most changes were seen in pathology processes and adjuvant treatment decisions. Physicians valued the addition of the 70-gene signature information as beneficial for patient management. Patient-centeredness (n = 77, response 78 percent): patients receiving a concordant high-risk and discordant clinical low/high risk-signature showed significantly more negative emotions with respect to receiving both test-results compared with concordant low-risk and discordant clinical high/low risk-signature patients. The first scenario was written in 2004 before the introduction of the 70-gene signature and identified hypothetical developments that could influence diffusion; especially the "what-if" deviation describing a discussion on validity among physicians proved to be realistic. Differences in speed of implementation and influenced treatment decisions were seen. Impact on patients seems especially related to discordance and its successive communication. In the future, scenario drafting will lead to input for model-based cost-effectiveness analysis. Finally, CTA can be useful as a tool to guide CED by adding monitoring and anticipation on possible developments during early implementation, to the assessment of promising new technologies.

The 70-gene signature (MammaPrint) is a prognostic test used to guide adjuvant treatment decisions in patients with node-negative breast cancer. In order to decide upon its use, a systematic comparative analysis of the effects of the 70-gene signature, the Sankt Gallen guidelines and the Adjuvant Online Software for these patients on survival, quality of life and costs is warranted. A Markov decision model was used to simulate the 20-year costs and outcomes (survival and quality-of-life adjusted survival (QALYs)) in a hypothetical cohort of node-negative, estrogen receptor positive breast cancer patients. Sensitivity and specificity of the three prognostic tools were based on 5 and 10 years breast cancer specific survival and distant metastasis as first event, derived from a pooled analysis consisting of 305 tumour samples from 3 previously reported validation studies concerning the 70-gene signature. Small differences in survival, but substantial differences in quality-adjusted survival between the prognostic tools were observed. Quality-adjusted survival was highest when using the 70-gene signature. Based on costs per QALY, the 70-gene has the highest probability of being cost-effective for a willingness to pay for a QALY higher than euro12.000. Sankt Gallen showed the highest survival rates compared to the 70-gene signature, but leads to a substantial larger amount of adjuvant chemotherapy and lower cost-effectiveness, thus demanding a high willingness to pay to save a life year. When deciding upon the cost-effectiveness of the prognostic tests, the 70-gene signature improves quality-adjusted survival and has the highest probability of being cost-effective.

Multigene assays have been developed and validated to determine the prognosis of breast cancer. In this study, we assessed the additional predictive value of the 70-gene MammaPrint signature for chemotherapy (CT) benefit in addition to endocrine therapy (ET) from pooled study series. For 541 patients who received either ET (n = 315) or ET + CT (n = 226), breast cancer-specific survival (BCSS) and distant disease-free survival (DDFS) at 5 years were assessed separately for the 70-gene high and low risk groups. The 70-gene signature classified 252 patients (47%) as low risk and 289 (53%) as high risk. Within the 70-gene low risk group, BCSS was 97% for the ET group and 99% for the ET + CT group at 5 years with a non-significant univariate hazard ratio (HR) of 0.58 (95% CI 0.07-4.98; P = 0.62). In the 70-gene high risk group, BCSS was 81% (ET group) and 94% (ET + CT group) at 5 years with a significant HR of 0.21 (95% CI 0.07-0.59; P < 0.01). DDFS was 93% (ET) versus 99% (ET + CT), respectively, in the 70-gene low risk group, HR 0.26 (95% CI 0.03-2.02; P = 0.20). In the high risk group DDFS was 76 versus 88%, HR of 0.35 (95% CI 0.17-0.71; P < 0.01). Results were similar in multivariate analysis, showing significant survival benefit by adding CT in the 70-gene high risk group. A significant and clinically meaningful benefit was observed by adding chemotherapy to endocrine treatment in 70-gene high risk patients. This benefit was not significant in low risk patients, who were at such low risk for recurrence and cancer-related death, that adding CT does not appear to be clinically meaningful.

overexpression of HER-2 is observed in 15-25% of breast cancers, and is associated with increased risk of recurrence. Current guidelines recommend trastuzumab and chemotherapy for most HER-2-positive patients. However, the majority of patients does not recur and might thus be overtreated with adjuvant systemic therapy. We investigated whether the 70-gene MammaPrint signature identifies HER-2-positive patients with favourable outcome. in all, 168 T1-3, N0-1, HER-2-positive patients were identified from a pooled database, classified by the 70-gene signature as good or poor prognosis, and correlated with long-term outcome. A total of 89 of these patients did not receive adjuvant chemotherapy. in the group of 89 chemotherapy-naive patients, after a median follow-up of 7.4 years, 35 (39%) distant recurrences and 29 (33%) breast cancer-specific deaths occurred. The 70-gene signature classified 20 (22%) patients as good prognosis, with 10-year distant disease-free survival (DDFS) of 84%, compared with 69 (78%) poor prognosis patients with 10-year DDFS of 55%. The estimated hazard ratios (HRs) were 4.5 (95% confidence interval (CI) 1.1-18.7, P=0.04) and 3.8 (95% CI 0.9-15.8, P=0.07) for DDFS and breast cancer-specific survival (BCSS), respectively. In multivariate analysis adjusted for known prognostic factors and hormonal therapy, HRs were 5.8 (95% CI 1.3-26.7, P=0.03) and 4.7 (95% CI 1.0-21.7, P=0.05) for DDFS and BCSS, respectively. the 70-gene prognosis signature is an independent prognostic indicator that identifies a subgroup of HER-2-positive early breast cancer with a favourable long-term outcome.

The 70 gene-signature (MammaPrint(®)) is a prognostic profile of distant recurrence and survival of primary breast cancer (BC). BC patients with 4-9 positive nodes (LN 4-9) are considered clinically at high-risk. Herein we examined MammaPrint(®) added prognostic value in this group. MammaPrint(®) profiles were generated from frozen tumours of patients operated from primary BC. Samples were classified as genomic Low Risk (GLR) or genomic High Risk (GHR). Among the 173 samples, 70 (40%) were classified as GLR and 103 (60%) as GHR. Tumours in the GHR group were significantly more often ductal carcinomas (93%), grade 3 (60%), oestrogen and progesterone-negative, Her2 positive (25%). In the GLR category, the 5-year overall survival was 97% vs. 76% for in the GHR group (p < 0.01); Distant Metastasis Free Survival (DMFS) at 5 years was 87% for GLR patients and 63% for GHR patients (p < 0.01). In the Luminal A subgroup, the genomic profile was the only independent risk factor for DM and BC specific death. In the Luminal A subgroup, MammaPrint(®) is an independent prognostic marker in BC patients with LN 4-9 and may be integrated in a selection strategy of patients candidate for more aggressive therapeutic approaches.

The 70-gene signature (MammaPrint™) has been developed on retrospective series of breast cancer patients to predict the risk of breast cancer distant metastases. The microarRAy-prognoSTics-in-breast-cancER (RASTER) study was the first study designed to prospectively evaluate the performance of the 70-gene signature, which result was available for 427 patients (cT1-3N0M0). Adjuvant systemic treatment decisions were based on the Dutch CBO 2004 guidelines, the 70-gene signature and doctors' and patients' preferences. Five-year distant-recurrence-free-interval (DRFI) probabilities were compared between subgroups based on the 70-gene signature and Adjuvant! Online (AOL) (10-year survival probability <90% was defined as high-risk). Median follow-up was 61.6 months. Fifteen percent (33/219) of the 70-gene signature low-risk patients received adjuvant chemotherapy (ACT) versus 81% (169/208) of the 70-gene signature high-risk patients. The 5-year DRFI probabilities for 70-gene signature low-risk (n = 219) and high-risk (n = 208) patients were 97.0% and 91.7%. The 5-year DRFI probabilities for AOL low-risk (n = 132) and high-risk (n = 295) patients were 96.7% and 93.4%. For 70-gene signature low-risk-AOL high-risk patients (n = 124), of whom 76% (n = 94) had not received ACT, 5-year DRFI was 98.4%. In the AOL high-risk group, 32% (94/295) less patients would be eligible to receive ACT if the 70-gene signature was used. In this prospective community-based observational study, the 5-year DRFI probabilities confirmed the additional prognostic value of the 70-gene signature to clinicopathological risk estimations such as AOL. Omission of adjuvant chemotherapy as judged appropriate by doctors and patients and instigated by a low-risk 70-gene signature result, appeared not to compromise outcome.

Formalin Fixed Paraffin Embedded (FFPE) samples represent a valuable resource for cancer research. However, the discovery and development of new cancer biomarkers often requires fresh frozen (FF) samples. Recently, the Whole Genome (WG) DASL (cDNA-mediated Annealing, Selection, extension and Ligation) assay was specifically developed to profile FFPE tissue. However, a thorough comparison of data generated from FFPE RNA and Fresh Frozen (FF) RNA using this platform is lacking. To this end we profiled, in duplicate, 20 FFPE tissues and 20 matched FF tissues and evaluated the concordance of the DASL results from FFPE and matched FF material. We show that after proper normalization, all FFPE and FF pairs exhibit a high level of similarity (Pearson correlation >0.7), significantly larger than the similarity between non-paired samples. Interestingly, the probes showing the highest correlation had a higher percentage G/C content and were enriched for cell cycle genes. Predictions of gene expression signatures developed on frozen material (Intrinsic subtype, Genomic Grade Index, 70 gene signature) showed a high level of concordance between FFPE and FF matched pairs. Interestingly, predictions based on a 60 gene DASL list (best match with the 70 gene signature) showed very high concordance with the MammaPrint® results. We demonstrate that data generated from FFPE material with the DASL assay, if properly processed, are comparable to data extracted from the FF counterpart. Specifically, gene expression profiles for a known set of prognostic genes for a specific disease are highly comparable between two conditions. This opens up the possibility of using both FFPE and FF material in gene expressions analyses, leading to a vast increase in the potential resources available for cancer research.

The 70-gene signature (MammaPrint) is a prognostic tool used to guide adjuvant treatment decisions. The aim of this study was to assess its value to predict chemosensitivity in the neoadjuvant setting. We obtained the 70-gene profile of stage II-III patients prior to neoadjuvant chemotherapy and classified the prognosis-signatures. Pathological complete remission (pCR) was used to measure chemosensitivity. Among 167 patients, 144 (86%) were having a poor and 23 (14%) a good prognosis-signature. None of the good prognosis-signature patients achieved a pCR (0/23), whereas 29/144 patients (20%) in the poor prognosis-signature group did (P = 0.015). All triple-negative tumors (n = 38) had a poor prognosis-signature. Within the non triple-negative subgroup, the response of the primary tumor remained associated with the classification of the prognosis-signature (P = 0.023). A pCR is unlikely to be achieved in tumors that have a good prognosis-signature. Tumors with a poor prognosis-signature are more sensitive to chemotherapy.

The clinical significance of tumor-infiltrating immune cells has been reported in a variety of human carcinomas including breast cancer. However, molecular signature of tumor-infiltrating immune cells and their prognostic value in breast cancer patients remain elusive. We hypothesized that a distinct network of immune function genes at the tumor site can predict a low risk versus high risk of distant relapse in breast cancer patients regardless of the status of ER, PR, or HER-2/neu in their tumors. We conducted retrospective studies in a diverse cohort of breast cancer patients with a 1-5 year tumor relapse versus those with up to 7 years relapse-free survival. The RNAs were extracted from the frozen tumor specimens at the time of diagnosis and subjected to microarray analysis and real-time RT-PCR. Paraffin-embedded tissues were also subjected to immunohistochemistry staining. We determined that a network of immune function genes involved in B cell development, interferon signaling associated with allograft rejection and autoimmune reaction, antigen presentation pathway, and cross talk between adaptive and innate immune responses were exclusively upregulated in patients with relapse-free survival. Among the 299 genes, five genes which included B cell response genes were found to predict with >85% accuracy relapse-free survival. Real-time RT-PCR confirmed the 5-gene prognostic signature that was distinct from an FDA-cleared 70-gene signature of MammaPrint panel and from the Oncotype DX recurrence score assay panel. These data suggest that neoadjuvant immunotherapy in patients with high risk of relapse may reduce tumor recurrence by inducing the immune function genes.

MammaPrint was developed as a diagnostic tool to predict risk of breast cancer metastasis using the expression of 70 genes. To better understand the tumor biology assessed by MammaPrint, we interpreted the biological functions of the 70-genes and showed how the genes reflect the six hallmarks of cancer as defined by Hanahan and Weinberg. We used a bottom-up system biology approach to elucidate how the cellular processes reflected by the 70-genes work together to regulate tumor activities and progression. The biological functions of the genes were analyzed using literature research and several bioinformatics tools. Protein-protein interaction network analyses indicated that the 70-genes form highly interconnected networks and that their expression levels are regulated by key tumorigenesis related genes such as TP53, RB1, MYC, JUN and CDKN2A. The biological functions of the genes could be associated with the essential steps necessary for tumor progression and metastasis, and cover the six well-defined hallmarks of cancer, reflecting the acquired malignant characteristics of a cancer cell along with tumor progression and metastasis-related biological activities. Genes in the MammaPrint gene signature comprehensively measure the six hallmarks of cancer-related biology. This finding establishes a link between a molecular signature and the underlying molecular mechanisms of tumor cell progression and metastasis.

Most node-negative breast cancer patients are older and postmenopausal and are increasingly being offered adjuvant chemotherapy despite their low overall risk of distant relapse. A molecular diagnostic test with high negative predictive value (NPV) for distant metastasis in this subgroup would spare many older breast cancer patients adjuvant treatment. We determined the NPV and positive predictive value of the MammaPrint assay in breast cancer patients who were consecutively diagnosed and treated at the Massachusetts General Hospital between 1985 and 1997. Primary tumors from 100 patients with node-negative, invasive breast cancer (median age, 62.5 years; median follow-up, 11.3 years) were subjected to MammaPrint analysis and classified as being at either low or high risk for distant metastasis. The MammaPrint 70-gene signature displayed excellent NPV as in previous studies, correctly identifying 100% of women at low risk for distant metastases at 5 years. However, this assay had a lower positive predictive value (12% at 5 years) than previously observed. The MammaPrint assay was originally designed to identify younger breast cancer patients at low risk for distant metastasis, who might consequently be spared systemic treatment. We show here that the same signature has a very high NPV for distant recurrence after adjuvant treatment in older breast cancer patients.

Numerous studies have used microarrays to identify gene signatures for predicting cancer patient clinical outcome and responses to chemotherapy. However, the potential impact of gene expression profiling in cancer diagnosis, prognosis and development of personalized treatment may not be fully exploited due to the lack of consensus gene signatures and poor understanding of the underlying molecular mechanisms. We developed a novel approach to derive gene signatures for breast cancer prognosis in the context of known biological pathways. Using unsupervised methods, cancer patients were separated into distinct groups based on gene expression patterns in one of the following pathways: apoptosis, cell cycle, angiogenesis, metastasis, p53, DNA repair, and several receptor-mediated signaling pathways including chemokines, EGF, FGF, HIF, MAP kinase, JAK and NF-kappaB. The survival probabilities were then compared between the patient groups to determine if differential gene expression in a specific pathway is correlated with differential survival. Our results revealed expression of cell cycle genes is strongly predictive of breast cancer outcomes. We further confirmed this observation by building a cell cycle gene signature model using supervised methods. Validated in multiple independent datasets, the cell cycle gene signature is a more accurate predictor for breast cancer clinical outcome than the previously identified Amsterdam 70-gene signature that has been developed into a FDA approved clinical test MammaPrint. Taken together, the gene expression signature model we developed from well defined pathways is not only a consistently powerful prognosticator but also mechanistically linked to cancer biology. Our approach provides an alternative to the current methodology of identifying gene expression markers for cancer prognosis and drug responses using the whole genome gene expression data.

Breast cancer patients with node positive disease can have an excellent outcome with tamoxifen only. It is unclear whether analysing both the 70-gene signature and hormone receptors provides superior prediction of outcome in tamoxifen-treated patients than either alone. Three series were evaluated: 121 patients (81% node positive) received adjuvant tamoxifen, 151 patients did not receive tamoxifen (10% node positive) and 92 patients received tamoxifen for metastatic disease. The 70-gene signature was analysed using MammaPrint. Oestrogen receptor (ER) and progesterone receptor (PR) immunohistochemistry was evaluated following St. Gallen Consensus (Highly Endocrine Responsive: ER and PR ≥ 50%, Incompletely Endocrine Responsive: ER and/or PR low or either one absent). In patients treated with adjuvant tamoxifen, both the 70-gene signature (adjusted for Endocrine Response Categories HR 2.17, 95%CI 1.01-4.66) as well as the Endocrine Response Categories (adjusted for 70-gene signature HR 6.35, 95%CI 1.90-21.3) were associated with breast-cancer-specific-survival (BCSS). Also in patients treated with tamoxifen for metastatic disease, combined analysis of the 70-gene signature and ER/PR revealed additional value (multivariate Cox regression, p = 0.013). In patients who did not receive tamoxifen, only the 70-gene signature was associated with outcome. In the series analysed, the 70-gene signature was mainly a prognostic factor, while ER and PR levels were mainly associated with outcome after tamoxifen. Combination of these three factors may improve outcome prediction in tamoxifen-treated patients.
