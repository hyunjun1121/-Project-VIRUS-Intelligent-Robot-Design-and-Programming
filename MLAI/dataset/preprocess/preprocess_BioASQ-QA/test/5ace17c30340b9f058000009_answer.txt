IDEAL_ANSWER:
- A previously reported association between the olfactory receptor or7d4 and the androstenone was not detected until we specifically typed this gene  p = 1.1 × 10  -4.Any mammals can decipher these scent codes to discern the gender , age , endocrine status , social status , and genotype of conspecifics using dedicated sensory receptors in their olfactory system.
- These findings suggest that 1) the perceived intensity of some but not all odorants is a heritable trait, 2) use of a current genome-wide marker panel did not detect a known olfactory genotype-phenotype association, and 3) person-to-person differences in androstenone perception are influenced by OR7D4 genotype and perhaps by variants of other genes.
