Which biological process takes place in nuclear speckles?

[PMID: 12923522]
Speckles are subnuclear structures that are enriched in pre-messenger RNA splicing factors and are located in the interchromatin regions of the nucleoplasm of mammalian cells. At the fluorescence-microscope level they appear as irregular, punctate structures, which vary in size and shape, and when examined by electron microscopy they are seen as clusters of interchromatin granules. Speckles are dynamic structures, and both their protein and RNA-protein components can cycle continuously between speckles and other nuclear locations, including active transcription sites. Studies on the composition, structure and behaviour of speckles have provided a model for understanding the functional compartmentalization of the nucleus and the organization of the gene-expression machinery.

Intestinal epithelial cells are constantly stimulated by reactive oxidant metabolites (ROMs) in inflamed mucosa. Monochloramine (NH2Cl), a cell-permeant ROM, is particularly relevant to the pathogenesis of inflammation in the gastrointestinal tract. Nuclear speckles, a unique nuclear subcompartment, accumulate a family of proteins, namely, serine- and arginine-rich (SR) proteins. They play important roles in regulation of pre-mRNA splicing. Currently, little is known about the link between inflammatory stimulation and the pre-mRNA splicing process, although gene expression is changed in inflamed tissues. The present study was designed to investigate whether stimulation of human colonic epithelial cells (HT-29 and Caco-2 cell lines) with NH2Cl affects nuclear speckles and their components. By indirect immunofluorescence, nuclear speckles have been shown to undergo rapid aggregation after NH2Cl stimulation. By utilizing Western blotting, SRp30 (a subset of SR proteins) in intestinal epithelial cells was found to be phosphorylated after NH2Cl treatment, whereas other SR proteins were not responsive to NH2Cl stimulation. The cytotoxic effect of NH2Cl was excluded by both negative lactate dehydrogenase assay and propidium iodide staining. Therefore, NH2Cl-induced morphological changes on nuclear speckles and phosphorylated SRp30 do not result from intestinal epithelial injury. Furthermore, the effect of NH2Cl on nuclear speckles and SRp30 was blocked by bisindolylmaleimide I, a selective PKC inhibitor. Together, the available data suggest that stimulation of intestinal epithelial cells with NH2Cl results in a consequent change on pre-mRNA splicing machinery via a distinctive signal pathway involving activation of PKC. This effect may contribute to oxidant-induced pathophysiological changes in the gastrointestinal tract.

Nuclear speckles (speckles) represent a distinct nuclear compartment within the interchromatin space and are enriched in splicing factors. In a previous study (Melc√°k et al., 2001), it has been shown that the pre-spliceosomal assembly on microinjected splicing-competent precursor mRNA takes place in the speckles, and it has been suggested that the targeting of RNA into speckes consists of two interdependent steps, namely the diffusion process, followed by the energy-dependent translocation of RNA into the speckles. In the present study, we confirm the existence of these two steps and show that this latter translocation is ATP dependent.

C3G (Crk SH3 domain binding guanine nucleotide releasing factor) (Rap guanine nucleotide exchange factor 1), essential for mammalian embryonic development, is ubiquitously expressed and undergoes regulated nucleocytoplasmic exchange. Here we show that C3G localizes to SC35-positive nuclear speckles and regulates splicing activity. Reversible association of C3G with speckles was seen on inhibition of transcription and splicing. C3G shows partial colocalization with SC35 and is recruited to a chromatin and RNase-sensitive fraction of speckles. Its presence in speckles is dependent on intact cellular actin cytoskeleton and is lost on expression of the kinase Clk1. Rap1, a substrate of C3G, is also present in nuclear speckles, and inactivation of Rap signaling by expression of GFP-Rap1GAP alters speckle morphology and number. Enhanced association of C3G with speckles is seen on glycogen synthase kinase 3 beta inhibition or differentiation of C2C12 cells to myotubes. CRISPR/Cas9-mediated knockdown of C3G resulted in altered splicing activity of an artificial gene as well as endogenous CD44. C3G knockout clones of C2C12 as well as MDA-MB-231 cells showed reduced protein levels of several splicing factors compared with control cells. Our results identify C3G and Rap1 as novel components of nuclear speckles and a role for C3G in regulating cellular RNA splicing activity.

In vertebrates, the majority of mRNAs that encode secreted, membrane-bound or mitochondrial proteins contain RNA elements that activate an alternative mRNA nuclear export (ALREX) pathway. Here we demonstrate that mRNAs containing ALREX-promoting elements are trafficked through nuclear speckles. Although ALREX-promoting elements enhance nuclear speckle localization, additional features within the mRNA largely drive this process. Depletion of two TREX-associated RNA helicases, UAP56 and its paralog URH49, or inhibition of the TREX-associated nuclear transport factor, TAP, not only inhibits ALREX, but also appears to trap these mRNAs in nuclear speckles. mRNAs that contain ALREX-promoting elements associate with UAP56 in vivo. Finally, we demonstrate that mRNAs lacking a poly(A)-tail are not efficiently exported by the ALREX pathway and show enhanced association with nuclear speckles. Our data suggest that within the speckle, ALREX-promoting elements, in conjunction with the poly(A)-tail, likely stimulate UAP56/URH49 and TAP dependent steps that lead to the eventual egress of the export-competent mRNP from these structures.

The human genetic disorders caused by CAG repeat expansions in the translated sequences of various genes are called polyglutamine (polyQ) diseases because of the cellular "toxicity" of the mutant proteins. The contribution of mutant transcripts to the pathogenesis of these diseases is supported by several observations obtained from cellular models of these disorders. Here, we show that the common feature of cell lines modeling polyQ diseases is the formation of nuclear CAG RNA foci. We performed qualitative and quantitative analyses of these foci in numerous cellular models endogenously and exogenously expressing mutant transcripts by fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH). We compared the CAG RNA foci of polyQ diseases with the CUG foci of myotonic dystrophy type 1 and found substantial differences in their number and morphology. Smaller differences within the polyQ disease group were also revealed and included a positive correlation between the foci number and the CAG repeat length. We show that expanded CAA repeats, also encoding glutamine, did not trigger RNA foci formation and foci formation is independent of the presence of mutant polyglutamine protein. Using FISH combined with immunofluorescence, we demonstrated partial co-localization of CAG repeat foci with MBNL1 alternative splicing factor, which explains the mild deregulation of MBNL1-dependent genes. We also showed that foci reside within nuclear speckles in diverse cell types: fibroblasts, lymphoblasts, iPS cells and neuronal progenitors and remain dependent on integrity of these nuclear structures.

A significant fraction of mRNAs are degraded by the nuclear exosome in normal cells. Here, we studied where and when these exosome target mRNAs are sorted away from properly exported ones in the cells. We show that upon exosome inactivation, polyA RNAs are apparently accumulated in nuclear foci that are distinct from nuclear speckles (NSs), and provide several lines of evidence supporting that these polyA RNAs mainly correspond to accumulating exosome target mRNAs. These results suggest that exosomal mRNA degradation mostly occurs outside of NSs. In support of this possibility, targeting exosome target mRNAs to NSs stabilizes them by preventing exosomal degradation. Furthermore, inhibiting mRNA release from NSs does not attenuate exosomal degradation in normal cells, and results in polyA RNA accumulation both inside and outside of NSs in exosome inactivated cells, suggesting that passage through NSs is not required for sorting mRNAs for degradation or export. Indeed, exosome target mRNAs that normally do not enter NSs are exported upon exosome inactivation. Together, our data suggest that exosome target mRNAs are mainly degraded in the nucleoplasm before entering NSs and rapid removal of these mRNAs is important for preventing their nuclear export.

DNAJC17 is a heat shock protein (HSP40) family member, identified in mouse as susceptibility gene for congenital hypothyroidism. DNAJC17 knockout mouse embryos die prior to implantation. In humans, germline homozygous mutations in DNAJC17 have been found in syndromic retinal dystrophy patients, while heterozygous mutations represent candidate pathogenic events for myeloproliferative disorders. Despite widespread expression and involvement in human diseases, DNAJC17 function is still poorly understood. Herein, we have investigated its function through high-throughput transcriptomic and proteomic approaches. DNAJC17-depleted cells transcriptome highlighted genes involved in general functional categories, mainly related to gene expression. Conversely, DNAJC17 interactome can be classified in very specific functional networks, with the most enriched one including proteins involved in splicing. Furthermore, several splicing-related interactors, were independently validated by co-immunoprecipitation and in vivo co-localization. Accordingly, co-localization of DNAJC17 with SC35, a marker of nuclear speckles, further supported its interaction with spliceosomal components. Lastly, DNAJC17 up-regulation enhanced splicing efficiency of minigene reporter in live cells, while its knockdown induced perturbations of splicing efficiency at whole genome level, as demonstrated by specific analysis of RNAseq data. In conclusion, our study strongly suggests a role of DNAJC17 in splicing-related processes and provides support to its recognized essential function in early development.

Nuclear speckles (NSs) serve as splicing factor storage sites. In this study, we unexpectedly found that many endogenous intronless mRNAs, which do not undergo splicing, associate with NSs. These associations do not require transcription, polyadenylation, or the polyA tail. Rather, exonic splicing enhancers present in intronless mRNAs and their binding partners, SR proteins, promote intronless mRNA localization to NSs. Significantly, speckle targeting of mRNAs promotes the recruitment of the TREX export complex and their TREX-dependent nuclear export. Furthermore, TREX, which accumulates in NSs, is required for releasing intronless mRNAs from NSs, whereas NXF1, which is mainly detected at nuclear pores, is not. Upon NXF1 depletion, the TREX protein UAP56 loses speckle concentration but coaccumulates with intronless mRNAs and polyA RNAs in the nucleoplasm, and these RNAs are trapped in NSs upon UAP56 codepletion. We propose that the export-competent messenger RNP assembly mainly occurs in NSs for intronless mRNAs and that entering NSs serves as a quality control step in mRNA export.
