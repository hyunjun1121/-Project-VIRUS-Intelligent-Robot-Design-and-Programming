What type of drug is apixaban?

[PMID: 27653758]
Apixaban (Eliquis<sup>®</sup>) is an oral, direct factor Xa inhibitor that is available for use in the treatment and secondary prevention of venous thromboembolism (VTE). Like other direct oral anticoagulants (DOACs), apixaban has generally predictable pharmacological properties and does not require routine anticoagulation monitoring. In large phase III trials, oral apixaban was noninferior to subcutaneous enoxaparin sodium overlapped with and followed by oral warfarin (enoxaparin/warfarin) in the treatment of adults with acute VTE over 6 months with regard to the incidence of recurrent VTE or VTE-related death (AMPLIFY), and was significantly more effective than placebo in the prevention of recurrent VTE or all-cause mortality over 12 months in patients who had completed 6-12 months' anticoagulation treatment for VTE (AMPLIFY-EXT). Apixaban was generally well tolerated in these trials; the risks of major bleeding and the composite endpoint of major or clinically relevant nonmajor (CRNM) bleeding with apixaban were significantly lower than enoxaparin/warfarin in AMPLIFY and not significantly different from that of placebo in AMPLIFY-EXT. Similarly, in Japanese adults with acute VTE (AMPLIFY-J), apixaban was associated with a significantly lower risk of major or CRNM bleeding than unfractionated heparin plus warfarin, and no cases of recurrent VTE or VTE-related death over 24 weeks. Thus, apixaban is useful therapeutic alternative for the management of adults with VTE.
