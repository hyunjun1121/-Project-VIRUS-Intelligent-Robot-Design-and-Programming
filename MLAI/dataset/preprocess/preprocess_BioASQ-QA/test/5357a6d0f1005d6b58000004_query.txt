Which is the branch site consensus sequence in U12-dependent introns?

[PMID: 18824513]
Highly conserved sequences at the 5' splice site and branch site of U12-dependent introns are important determinants for splicing by U12-dependent spliceosomes. This study investigates the in vivo splicing phenotypes of mutations in the branch site consensus sequence of the U12-dependent intron F from a human NOL1 (P120) minigene. Intron F contains a fully consensus branch site sequence (UUCCUUAAC). Mutations at each position were analyzed for their effects on U12-dependent splicing in vivo. Mutations at most positions resulted in a significant reduction of correct U12-dependent splicing. Defects observed included increased unspliced RNA levels, the activation of cryptic U2-dependent 5' and 3' splice sites, and the activation of cryptic U12-dependent branch/3' splice sites. A strong correlation was observed between the predicted thermodynamic stability of the branch site: U12 snRNA interaction and correct U12-dependent splicing. The lack of a polypyrimidine tract between the branch site and 3' splice site of U12-dependent introns and the observed reliance on base-pairing interactions for correct U12-dependent splicing emphasize the importance of RNA/RNA interactions during U12-dependent intron recognition and proper splice site selection.
