Which gene-defect causes the Vel-blood type?

[PMID: 26732700]
The SMIM1 protein carries the Vel blood group antigen, and homozygosity for a 17 bp deletion in the coding region of the SMIM1 gene represents the molecular basis of the Vel- blood group phenotype. We developed PCR-based methods for typing the SMIM1 17 bp (64-80del) gene deletion and performed a molecular screening for the Vel- blood type in German blood donors. For SMIM1 genotyping, TaqMan-PCR and PCR-SSP methods were developed and validated using reference samples. Both methods were used for screening of donors with blood group O from southwestern Germany. Heterozygotes and homozygotes for the SMIM1 64-80del allele were serologically typed for the Vel blood group antigen. In addition, the rs1175550 SNP in SMIM1 was typed and correlated to the results of the phenotyping. Both genotyping methods, TaqMan-PCR and PCR-SSP, represent reliable methods for the detection of the SMIM1 64-80del allele. Screening of 10,598 blood group O donors revealed 5 individuals homozygous for the deletional allele. They were confirmed Vel- by serological typing. Heterozygotes for the 64-80del allele showed different antigen expressions ranging from very weak to regular positive. Molecular screening of blood donors for the Vel- blood type is feasible and avoids the limitations of serological typing which might show false-negative results with heterozygous individuals. The identification of Vel- blood donors significantly contributes to the adequate blood supply of patients with anti-Vel.

Here, we report the biochemical and genetic basis of the Vel blood group antigen, which has been a vexing mystery for decades, especially as anti-Vel regularly causes severe haemolytic transfusion reactions. The protein carrying the Vel blood group antigen was biochemically purified from red blood cell membranes. Mass spectrometry-based de novo peptide sequencing identified this protein to be small integral membrane protein 1 (SMIM1), a previously uncharacterized single-pass membrane protein. Expression of SMIM1 cDNA in Vel- cultured cells generated anti-Vel cell surface reactivity, confirming that SMIM1 encoded the Vel blood group antigen. A cohort of 70 Vel- individuals was found to be uniformly homozygous for a 17 nucleotide deletion in the coding sequence of SMIM1. The genetic homogeneity of the Vel- blood type, likely having a common origin, facilitated the development of two highly specific DNA-based tests for rapid Vel genotyping, which can be easily integrated into blood group genotyping platforms. These results answer a 60-year-old riddle and provide tools of immediate assistance to all clinicians involved in the care of Vel- patients.
