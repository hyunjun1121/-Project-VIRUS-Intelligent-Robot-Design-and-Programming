Which disease is associated with DNAJB1-PRKACA fusion gene?

[PMID: 29751881]
Fibrolamellar carcinoma is distinctive at clinical and histologic levels. A novel DNAJB1-PRKACA fusion gene characterizes almost all cases, distinguishes it from other hepatocellular neoplasms, and drives the pathogenesis of this unique tumor. A subset of cases of fibrolamellar carcinoma is associated with alternate mechanisms of protein kinase A activation. This review article discusses common and unusual histologic features of fibrolamellar carcinoma, its differential diagnoses, and how to make the diagnosis while avoiding key pitfalls. The impact of the discovery of the fusion gene on the understanding of the tumor and the prognosis of fibrolamellar carcinoma are also discussed.

The fibrolamellar carcinoma-associated DNAJB1-PRKACA gene fusion transcript RNA codes for the catalytic domain of protein kinase A and, thus, overexpression of Aurora kinase A. ENMD-2076 showed a favorable toxicity profile. The limited results, one patient (3%) with a partial response and 57% of patients with stable disease, do not support further evaluation of ENMD-2076 as single agent. Future studies will depend on the simultaneous targeting approach of DNAJB1-PRKACA and the critical downstream components. Fibrolamellar carcinoma (FLC) represents approximately 0.85% of liver cancers. The associated DNAJB1-PRKACA gene fusion transcript RNA codes for the catalytic domain of protein kinase A and overexpression of Aurora kinase A (AURKA). ENMD-2076 is a selective anti-AURKA inhibitor. Patients aged >12â€‰years with pathologically confirmed incurable FLC, with measurable disease, Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status 0-2 or Lansky 70-100, and adequate organ function were eligible. Patients were prescribed ENMD-2076 based on body surface area. The primary endpoint was overall objective response rate by RECIST v1.1, with a null hypothesis of true response rate of 2% versus one-sided alternative of 15%. Secondary endpoints included 6-month progression-free survival (PFS) rate (Fig. 1), median PFS, time to progression (TTP), and overall survival (OS). Safety was evaluated throughout the study. Of 35 patients who enrolled and received treatment, 1 (3%) had a partial response (PR) and 20 (57%) had stable disease (SD). Median TTP, PFS, and OS were 5, 3.9, and 19 months, respectively. The most frequently reported drug-related serious adverse event was hypertension in three patients. Three deaths were reported on-study-two due to disease progression and one due to pulmonary embolism not related to ENMD-2076. The study provided no rationale for further studying ENMD-2076 as a single agent in FLC.

Fibrolamellar carcinoma (FLC) is a rare variant of hepatocellular carcinoma, occurring in children and young adults without underlying liver disease. The diagnosis is based on morphological characteristics of the tumor, supplemented by immunohistochemistry and/or genetic testing. Recently, the presence of a characteristic DNAJB1-PRKACA fusion gene has been associated with FLC. Herein, we report a case of FLC presenting as peritoneal carcinomatosis in a 14-year-old female. Interestingly, no liver tumor was seen on imaging, and an alternative possibility is that the tumor arose outside the liver as a hepatoid carcinoma with fibrolamellar features.

Fibrolamellar carcinomas are characterized by activation of protein kinase A, a kinase composed of catalytic and regulatory subunits. PRKACA encodes a catalytic subunit of protein kinase A, and almost all fibrolamellar carcinomas have a heterozygous 400-kb deletion that leads to the fusion of DNAJB1 and PRKACA. The resulting DNAJB1-PRKACA fusion transcript is believed to activate protein kinase A by dysregulation of the catalytic portion of the protein. In contrast, PRKAR1A encodes one of the regulatory subunits of protein kinase A. We hypothesized that loss of function of this regulatory unit could also lead to protein kinase A activation and thus to fibrolamellar carcinoma. Because PRKAR1A mutations underlie the Carney complex, we searched for liver tumors in individuals with the Carney complex. We identified 3 individuals with fibrolamellar carcinomas and a personal history of the Carney complex. All three tumors displayed the typical morphology of fibrolamellar carcinoma and were positive for arginase, cytokeratin 7, and cluster of differentiation 68. Fluorescence in situ hybridization was negative for PRKACA rearrangements. However, PRKAR1A sequencing identified pathogenic mutations in two of two cases with successful sequencing. In addition, all three cases were negative for PRKAR1A protein expression, consistent with inactivation of this key regulatory unit of protein kinase A. We also identified one additional fibrolamellar carcinoma in an individual without a documented history of the Carney complex who was negative for PRKACA rearrangements but had loss of PRKAR1A protein expression as well as PRKAR1A mutations. Fibrolamellar carcinoma can be part of the Carney complex; in this setting, fibrolamellar carcinomas have inactivating PRKAR1A mutations instead of the DNAJB1-PRKACA fusion gene found in sporadic fibrolamellar carcinomas, providing an alternate means for activation of protein kinase A.
