What gene test is recommended for clopidogrel?

[PMID: 22974536]
A recent clinical trial has demonstrated that patients with acute coronary syndromes (ACS) and the reduced function allele CYP2C19*2 (*2 allele), who are treated with thienopyridines, have an increased risk of adverse cardiac events with clopidogrel, but not with prasugrel. The frequency of the *2 allele varies by ethnicity and the Maoris, Asians and Pacific Islanders of New Zealand have a relatively high incidence. Our objective was to evaluate, from a New Zealand health system perspective, the cost effectiveness of treating all ACS patients with generic clopidogrel compared with prasugrel, and also compared with the genetically guided strategy that *2 allele carriers receive prasugrel and non-carriers receive clopidogrel. A decision-tree model consisting of five health states (myocardial infarction, stroke, bleeding, stent thrombosis and cardiovascular death) was developed. Clinical outcome data (two TRITON-TIMI 38 genetic sub-studies) comparing clopidogrel and prasugrel for both *2 allele carriers and non-carriers were combined with the prevalence of the heterozygosity for the *2 allele in New Zealand Europeans (15%), Maoris (24%), Asians (29%) and Pacific Islanders (45%) to determine the predicted adverse event rate for the New Zealand population. National hospital diagnosis-related group (DRG) discharge codes were used to determine alternative adverse event rates, along with the costs of hospitalizations during the 15 months after patients presented with an ACS. The primary outcome measure was the incremental cost per QALY (calculated using literature-reported weights). Monte Carlo simulations and alternative scenario analysis based on both clinical trial and national hospital incidence were used. Additional analysis considered the overall TRITON-TIMI 38 rates. Costs (in New Zealand dollars [$NZ], year 2009 values) and benefits were discounted at 3% per annum. Actual hospital-based adverse event rates were higher than those reported in the TRITON-TIMI 38 randomized controlled trial and the genetic sub-studies, especially for myocardial infarction and cardiovascular death, and for Maoris and Pacific Islanders. For both sources of adverse event rates, treating the population with prasugrel was associated with worse outcomes (QALYs) than clopidogrel. However, prasugrel became cost effective ($NZ31 751/QALY) when the overall TRITON-TIMI 38 rates were used. A genetic test to guide the selected use of prasugrel was cost effective ($NZ8702/QALY versus $NZ24 617/QALY) for hospital and clinical trial incidence, respectively. Based on the hospital rates, the genetically guided strategy was especially cost effective for Maoris ($NZ7312/QALY) and Pacific Islanders ($NZ7041/QALY). These results were robust to the sensitivity analysis, except the genetically guided strategy under the 15-month clinical trial event rate scenario ($NZ168 748/QALY) did not remain cost effective under a $NZ50 000 threshold. Use of a genetic test to guide thienopyridine treatment in patients with ACS is a potentially cost-effective treatment strategy, especially for Maoris and Pacific Islanders. This treatment strategy also has the potential to reduce ethnic health disparities that exist in New Zealand. However, the results comparing clopidogrel and prasugrel are sensitive to whether the genetic sub-studies or the overall TRITON-TIMI 38 rates are used. While the national hospital event rates may be more appropriate for the New Zealand population, many assumptions are required when they are used to adjust the genetic sub-studies rates.

Genetic polymorphisms significantly influence responses to warfarin and clopidogrel. Polymorphisms in the cytochrome P450 (CYP) 2C9 and vitamin K epoxide reductase genes change warfarin pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics, respectively. Because these polymorphisms influence warfarin dose requirements, they may primarily help determine therapeutic warfarin doses in patients who newly start on the drug. To assist in estimating therapeutic warfarin doses, the warfarin label provides a pharmacogenomic dosing table and various warfarin pharmacogenomic dosing algorithms are available. On the other hand, polymorphisms in the CYP2C19 gene affect clopidogrel pharmacokinetics. These polymorphisms may be useful to identify clopidogrel nonresponders who may benefit from taking an alternative antiplatelet agent such as prasugrel and ticagrelor. Although both drugs have pharmacogenomic tests available for clinical use, their clinical utilities have not been established and are currently being actively studied. In this review, clinical application of warfarin and clopidogrel pharmacogenomics will be focused. With the current level of evidence, potential patients who may get benefit from warfarin and clopidogrel pharmacogenomic testing will be discussed. In addition, the interpretation of the warfarin and clopidogrel test results and the current barriers to widespread use of warfarin and clopidogrel pharmacogenomic testing will be discussed.

Prospective assessment of pharmacogenetic strategies has been limited by an inability to undertake bedside genetic testing. The CYP2C19*2 allele is a common genetic variant associated with increased rates of major adverse events in individuals given clopidogrel after percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI). We used a novel point-of-care genetic test to identify carriers of the CYP2C19*2 allele and aimed to assess a pharmacogenetic approach to dual antiplatelet treatment after PCI. Between Aug 26, 2010, and July 7, 2011, 200 patients were enrolled into our prospective, randomised, proof-of-concept study. Patients undergoing PCI for acute coronary syndrome or stable angina were randomly assigned to rapid point-of-care genotyping or to standard treatment. Individuals in the rapid genotyping group were screened for the CYP2C19*2 allele. Carriers were given 10 mg prasugrel daily, and non-carriers and patients in the standard treatment group were given 75 mg clopidogrel daily. The primary endpoint was the proportion of CYP2C19*2 carriers with high on-treatment platelet reactivity (P2Y12 reactivity unit [PRU] value of more than 234) after 1 week of dual antiplatelet treatment, which is a marker associated with increased adverse cardiovascular events. Interventional cardiologists and data analysts were masked to genetic status and treatment. Patients were not masked to treatment allocation. All analyses were by intention to treat. This study is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT01184300. After randomisation, 187 patients completed follow-up (91 rapid genotyping group, 96 standard treatment). 23 individuals in each group carried at least one CYP2C19*2 allele. None of the 23 carriers in the rapid genotyping group had a PRU value of more than 234 at day 7, compared with seven (30%) given standard treatment (p=0·0092). The point-of-care genetic test had a sensitivity of 100% (95% CI 92·3-100) and a specificity of 99·3% (96·3-100). Point-of-care genetic testing after PCI can be done effectively at the bedside and treatment of identified CYP2C19*2 carriers with prasugrel can reduce high on-treatment platelet reactivity.

The aim of this study was to evaluate the effect of polymorphisms affecting the clopidogrel metabolism (CYP3A4 IVS10+12G/A and CYP2C19*2) and the P2Y12 receptor (P2Y12 T744C) on modulating platelet function in acute coronary syndrome patients on dual antiplatelet treatment. Residual platelet reactivity (RPR) phenomenon on antiplatelet therapy requires clarification. P2Y12 T744C, CYP3A4 IVS10+12G/A and, in healthy individuals only, CYP2C19*2 polymorphisms have been investigated; however, the influence on platelet reactivity in a large population of high-risk vascular patients on dual antiplatelet treatment has not yet been elucidated. A total of 1419 acute coronary syndrome patients on dual antiplatelet treatment were studied. Platelet function was evaluated by platelet-rich plasma aggregation. Electronic nanochips and restriction-fragment length polymorphism were used for analysis of polymorphisms. Only CYP2C19*2, out of the three investigated polymorphisms, is associated with higher platelet reactivity. Carriers of the *2 allele had significantly higher platelet aggregation values after arachidonic acid (AA; P=0.043), 2 micromol/l adenosine 5' diphosphate (ADP; P<0.0001) and 10 micromol/l ADP (P=0.001) stimuli. The genotype distribution of CYP2C19*2 polymorphism significantly differed between patients with and without RPR, as evaluated by 10-micromol/l ADP-induced platelet aggregation (P=0.002) and by AA-induced platelet aggregation (P=0.045). At the multivariate linear regression analysis, the CYP2C19*2 polymorphism remained a significant and independent risk factor for dual antiplatelet treatment variability. This study demonstrates, for the first time, that the *2 CYP2C19 allele is associated with higher platelet aggregability and RPR in high-risk vascular patients on dual antiplatelet treatment. These findings can have a significant impact on the future design of pharmacogenetic antiaggregant strategies for high-risk vascular patients on dual antiplatelet treatment.

Coexisting polymorphisms of the genes affecting clopiogrel resistance may influence platelet activation. In 105 patients with acute coronary syndrome (ACS) treated with percutaneous coronary intervention, platelet function was measured and registered as closure time in the test with collagen and adenosine diphosphate (CADP-CT). Patients were followed for 12 months for death or recurrent myocardial infarction (MI). Genotyping revealed 7 carriers of both the C allele of P2Y12 and A allele of CYP2C19 (group 1), 14 carriers of the T allele of P2Y12 and A allele of CYP2C19 (group 2), 17 carriers of the C allele of P2Y12 and G allele of CYP2C19 (group 3) and 67 carriers of the T allele of P2Y12 and G allele of CYP2C19 (controls). The median CADP-CT value was significantly lower in group 1 than in group 2 or 3 (p<0.01) or controls (p<0.002), but did not differ between group 2 or 3 and controls. There were 2 cardiovascular deaths and 4 MI during follow-up, and the median CADP-CT value was lower in these patients (p=0.09). Coexisting, rather then single, polymorphisms of different genes may be related to persistent platelet activation while on clopidogrel, which raises concern about harm in patients with ACS.

Clopidogrel therapy improves cardiovascular outcomes in patients with acute coronary syndromes and following percutaneous coronary intervention by inhibiting adenosine diphosphate (ADP)-dependent platelet activation. However, nonresponsiveness is widely recognized and is related to recurrent ischemic events. To identify gene variants that influence clopidogrel response. In the Pharmacogenomics of Antiplatelet Intervention (PAPI) Study (2006-2008), we administered clopidogrel for 7 days to 429 healthy Amish persons and measured response by ex vivo platelet aggregometry. A genome-wide association study was performed followed by genotyping the loss-of-function cytochrome P450 (CYP) 2C19*2 variant (rs4244285). Findings in the PAPI Study were extended by examining the relation of CYP2C19*2 genotype to platelet function and cardiovascular outcomes in an independent sample of 227 patients undergoing percutaneous coronary intervention. ADP-stimulated platelet aggregation in response to clopidogrel treatment and cardiovascular events. Platelet response to clopidogrel was highly heritable (h(2) = 0.73; P < .001). Thirteen single-nucleotide polymorphisms on chromosome 10q24 within the CYP2C18-CYP2C19-CYP2C9-CYP2C8 cluster were associated with diminished clopidogrel response, with a high degree of statistical significance (P = 1.5 x 10(-13) for rs12777823, additive model). The rs12777823 polymorphism was in strong linkage disequilibrium with the CYP2C19*2 variant, and was associated with diminished clopidogrel response, accounting for 12% of the variation in platelet aggregation to ADP (P = 4.3 x 10(-11)). The relation between CYP2C19*2 genotype and platelet aggregation was replicated in clopidogrel-treated patients undergoing coronary intervention (P = .02). Furthermore, patients with the CYP2C19*2 variant were more likely (20.9% vs 10.0%) to have a cardiovascular ischemic event or death during 1 year of follow-up (hazard ratio, 2.42; 95% confidence interval, 1.18-4.99; P = .02). CYP2C19*2 genotype was associated with diminished platelet response to clopidogrel treatment and poorer cardiovascular outcomes.

Variants in the CYP2C19 gene influence the pharmacologic and clinical response to the standard 75-mg daily maintenance dose of the antiplatelet drug clopidogrel. To test whether higher doses (up to 300 mg daily) improve the response to clopidogrel in the setting of loss-of-function CYP2C19 genotypes. ELEVATE-TIMI 56 was a multicenter, randomized, double-blind trial that enrolled and genotyped 333 patients with cardiovascular disease across 32 sites from October 2010 until September 2011. Maintenance doses of clopidogrel for 4 treatment periods, each lasting approximately 14 days, based on genotype. In total, 247 noncarriers of a CYP2C19*2 loss-of-function allele were to receive 75 and 150 mg daily of clopidogrel (2 periods each), whereas 86 carriers (80 heterozygotes, 6 homozygotes) were to receive 75, 150, 225, and 300 mg daily. Platelet function test results (vasodilator-stimulated phosphoprotein [VASP] phosphorylation and VerifyNow P2Y(12) assays) and adverse events. With 75 mg daily, CYP2C19*2 heterozygotes had significantly higher on-treatment platelet reactivity than did noncarriers (VASP platelet reactivity index [PRI]: mean, 70.0%; 95% CI, 66.0%-74.0%, vs 57.5%; 95% CI, 55.1%-59.9%, and VerifyNow P2Y(12) reaction units [PRU]: mean, 225.6; 95% CI, 207.7-243.4, vs 163.6; 95% CI, 154.4-173.9; P < .001 for both comparisons). Among CYP2C19*2 heterozygotes, doses up to 300 mg daily significantly reduced platelet reactivity, with VASP PRI decreasing to 48.9% (95% CI, 44.6%-53.2%) and PRU to 127.5 (95% CI, 109.9-145.2) (P < .001 for trend across doses for both). Whereas 52% of CYP2C19*2 heterozygotes were nonresponders (≥230 PRU) with 75 mg of clopidogrel, only 10% were nonresponders with 225 or 300 mg (P < .001 for both). Clopidogrel, 225 mg daily, reduced platelet reactivity in CYP2C19*2 heterozygotes to levels achieved with standard clopidogrel, 75 mg, in noncarriers (mean ratios of platelet reactivity, VASP PRI, 0.92; 90% CI, 0.85-0.99, and PRU, 0.94; 90% CI, 0.84-1.04). In CYP2C19*2 homozygotes, even with 300 mg daily of clopidogrel, mean VASP PRI was 68.3% (95% CI, 44.9%-91.6%) and mean PRU, 287.0 (95% CI, 170.2-403.8). Among patients with stable cardiovascular disease, tripling the maintenance dose of clopidogrel to 225 mg daily in CYP2C19*2 heterozygotes achieved levels of platelet reactivity similar to that seen with the standard 75-mg dose in noncarriers; in contrast, for CYP2C19*2 homozygotes, doses as high as 300 mg daily did not result in comparable degrees of platelet inhibition. clinicaltrials.gov Identifier: NCT01235351.

This study sought to evaluate the influence of single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) on the pharmacodynamic effect of high- or standard-dose clopidogrel after percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI). There is a lack of prospective, multicenter data regarding the effect of different genetic variants on clopidogrel pharmacodynamics over time in patients undergoing PCI. The GRAVITAS (Gauging Responsiveness with A VerifyNow assay-Impact on Thrombosis And Safety) trial screened patients with platelet function testing after PCI and randomly assigned those with high on-treatment reactivity (OTR) to either high- or standard-dose clopidogrel; a cohort of patients without high OTR were also followed. DNA samples obtained from 1,028 patients were genotyped for 41 SNPs in 17 genes related to platelet reactivity. After adjusting for clinical characteristics, the associations between the SNPs and OTR using linear regression were evaluated. CYP2C19*2 was significantly associated with OTR at 12 to 24 h (R(2) = 0.07, p = 2.2 × 10(-15)), 30 days (R(2) = 0.10, p = 1.3 × 10(-7)), and 6 months after PCI (R(2) = 0.07, p = 1.9 × 10(-11)), whereas PON1, ABCB1 3435 C→T, and other candidate SNPs were not. Carriers of 1 and 2 reduced-function CYP2C19 alleles were significantly more likely to display persistently high OTR at 30 days and 6 months, irrespective of treatment assignment. The portion of the risk of persistently high OTR at 30 days attributable to reduced-function CYP2C19 allele carriage was 5.2% in the patients randomly assigned to high-dose clopidogrel. CYP2C19, but not PON1 or ABCB1, is a significant determinant of the pharmacodynamic effects of clopidogrel, both early and late after PCI. In patients with high OTR identified by platelet function testing, the CYP2C19 genotype provides limited incremental information regarding the risk of persistently high reactivity with clopidogrel 150-mg maintenance dosing.

The cost of genomic information has fallen steeply, but the clinical translation of genetic risk estimates remains unclear. We aimed to undertake an integrated analysis of a complete human genome in a clinical context. We assessed a patient with a family history of vascular disease and early sudden death. Clinical assessment included analysis of this patient's full genome sequence, risk prediction for coronary artery disease, screening for causes of sudden cardiac death, and genetic counselling. Genetic analysis included the development of novel methods for the integration of whole genome and clinical risk. Disease and risk analysis focused on prediction of genetic risk of variants associated with mendelian disease, recognised drug responses, and pathogenicity for novel variants. We queried disease-specific mutation databases and pharmacogenomics databases to identify genes and mutations with known associations with disease and drug response. We estimated post-test probabilities of disease by applying likelihood ratios derived from integration of multiple common variants to age-appropriate and sex-appropriate pre-test probabilities. We also accounted for gene-environment interactions and conditionally dependent risks. Analysis of 2.6 million single nucleotide polymorphisms and 752 copy number variations showed increased genetic risk for myocardial infarction, type 2 diabetes, and some cancers. We discovered rare variants in three genes that are clinically associated with sudden cardiac death-TMEM43, DSP, and MYBPC3. A variant in LPA was consistent with a family history of coronary artery disease. The patient had a heterozygous null mutation in CYP2C19 suggesting probable clopidogrel resistance, several variants associated with a positive response to lipid-lowering therapy, and variants in CYP4F2 and VKORC1 that suggest he might have a low initial dosing requirement for warfarin. Many variants of uncertain importance were reported. Although challenges remain, our results suggest that whole-genome sequencing can yield useful and clinically relevant information for individual patients.

The first aim of this study is to evaluate the biological effect of doubling the maintenance dose of clopidogrel in pre-defined clopidogrel "low responders", compared to the biological effect of the standard dose in "responders". The second aim is to test the influence of the CYP 2C19*2 allele on clopidogrel responsiveness. The platelet reactivity index (PRI), based on the phosphorylation status of the vasodilatator phosphoprotein, was determined in 81 consecutive cardiovascular outpatients who had been taking clopidogrel 75 mg/day for at least 15 days (visit 1). Patients with PRI>or=50% ("low responders") were then given clopidogrel 150 mg/day. All the patients were again evaluated 15 days later (visit 2) and were genotyped for the CYP 2C19*2 allele. At visit 1, PRI values ranged from 12.6% to 80.4%. In "low responders" (n=45), the mean PRI fell from 62.0+/-6.7% to 49.4+/-11.3% (P<0.001) after 15 days of clopidogrel 150 mg/day, while no significant change was observed in the other patients ("responders"), who remained on the standard dose (mean PRI: 37.7+/-10.4% and 39.9+/-10.8%, P=0.22, in visit 1 and 2, respectively). The CYP 2C19*2 allele was not associated with clopidogrel responsiveness. Increasing the maintenance dose of clopidogrel from 75 to 150 mg/day for 15 days in "low responders" is associated with a relative 20%-increase in its biological effect, independently of the CYP2C19 genotype, but without reaching the levels observed in "responders". The CYP 2C19*2 allele is not associated with clopidogrel responsiveness in our population of cardiovascular outpatients.

The antiplatelet effect of clopidogrel has been linked to cytochrome P450 2C19 (CYP2C19) carrier status. The presence of loss of function and gain of function variants were found to have a gene-dose effect on clopidogrel metabolism. However, genotyping is only one aspect of predicting response to clopidogrel and several platelet function tests are available to measure platelet response. Patients and methods We studied the influence of CYP2C19 allelic variants on on-treatment platelet reactivity as assessed by light transmission aggregometry (LTA), the VerifyNow P2Y12 assay, the VASP assay, multiple electrode aggregometry (MEA), and the Impact-R in 288 patients after stenting for cardiovascular disease. Allelic variants of CYP2C19 were determined with the Infiniti® CYP450 2C19+ assay and categorized into four metabolizer states (ultrarapid, extensive, intermediate, poor). Platelet reactivity increased linearly from ultrarapid to poor metabolizers using the VerifyNow P2Y12 assay (P = 0.04), the VASP assay (P = 0.02) and the Impact-R (P = 0.04). The proportion of patients with high on-treatment residual platelet reactivity (HRPR) identified by LTA, the VerifyNow P2Y12 assay and the VASP assay increased when the metabolizer status decreased, while no such relationship could be identified for results of MEA and Impact-R. The presence of loss of function variants (*2/*2, *2-8*/wt, *2/*17) was an independent predictor of HRPR in LTA and the VASP assay while it did not reach statistical significance in the VerifyNow P2Y12 assay, MEA, and the Impact-R. Depending on the type of platelet function test differences in the association of on-treatment platelet reactivity with CYP2C19 carrier status are observed.

The cytochrome P450 (CYP) 2C19*2 loss-of-function allele has been associated with impaired clopidogrel response and worse prognosis in clopidogrel-treated patients. The benefit of tailored therapy according to platelet function test results remains unclear, and the potential effect of genotypes on this benefit has not been addressed in unstable patients. The present study was designed to evaluate the benefit of tailored therapy with a higher maintenance dose according to CYP2C19 genotypes in patients identified as nonresponders who underwent percutaneous coronary intervention for non-ST-segment elevation acute coronary syndromes. Three hundred forty-six consecutive patients were enrolled and received a loading dose of 600 mg, including 86 *2 carriers (13 homozygotes and 73 heterozygotes) and 260 *2 noncarriers. Clopidogrel response, assessed with platelet reactivity index vasoactive-stimulated phosphoprotein, was significantly affected by genotype, with lower clopidogrel response in CYP2C19*2 allele carriers (p = 0.01). Accordingly, the rate of clopidogrel nonresponse was higher in CYP2C19*2 allele carriers (53% vs 41%, p = 0.04). All clopidogrel nonresponders (n = 151), including 105 *2 noncarriers and 46 *2 carriers, received high 150-mg clopidogrel maintenance doses at discharge to overcome initial low response. After 1 month, high maintenance doses overcame clopidogrel low response in only 44% of the whole population and significantly less frequently in *2 carriers than in noncarriers (28% vs 50%, p = 0.01). In conclusion, higher clopidogrel maintenance doses were able to overcome clopidogrel low response in fewer than half of clopidogrel low responders who underwent percutaneous coronary intervention for non-ST-segment elevation acute coronary syndromes. The benefit of this tailored therapy was significantly reduced in CYP2C19*2 carriers. Therefore, these patients might require alternative strategies with new P2Y₁₂ blockers.

The cytochrome P450 (CYP) 2C19 isoenzyme plays an important role in clopidogrel metabolization. A recently explored CYP2C19*17 allelic variant has been linked to increased transcriptional activity, resulting in extensive metabolization of CYP2C19 substrates, which may lead to an enhanced platelet response to clopidogrel treatment. The aim of this study was to assess the impact of CYP2C19*17 on ADP-induced platelet aggregation, the risk of bleeding, and stent thrombosis in clopidogrel-treated patients undergoing percutaneous coronary intervention. The study population included 1524 patients undergoing percutaneous coronary intervention after pretreatment with 600 mg clopidogrel. Genotypes were determined with a TaqMan assay. ADP-induced platelet aggregation was assessed on a Multiplate analyzer. The primary clinical safety end point was the 30-day incidence of bleeding defined according to Thrombolysis in Myocardial Infarction criteria, and the primary clinical efficacy end point was the 30-day incidence of stent thrombosis. For both heterozygous (*wt/*17; n=546) and homozygous (*17/*17; n=76) allele carriers, significantly lower ADP-induced platelet aggregation values were found compared with wild-type homozygotes (*wt/*wt; n=902; P=0.039 and P=0.008, respectively). CYP2C19*17 allele carriage was significantly associated with an increased risk of bleeding; the highest risk was observed for CYP2C19*17 homozygous patients (P=0.01, chi(2) test for trend). Multivariate analysis confirmed the independent association of CYP2C19*17 allele carriage with platelet aggregation values (P<0.001) and the occurrence of bleeding (P=0.006). No significant influence of CYP2C19*17 on the occurrence of stent thrombosis was found (P=0.79). CYP2C19*17 carrier status is significantly associated with enhanced response to clopidogrel and an increased risk of bleeding.
