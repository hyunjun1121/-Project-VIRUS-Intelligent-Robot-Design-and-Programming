IDEAL_ANSWER:
- The transcription factor CCAAT/enhancer binding protein β (C/EBPβ) plays critical roles in the differentiation and proliferation of hematopoietic stem cells.
- The transcription factor CCAAT/enhancer binding protein β (C/EBPβ) plays critical roles in emergency granulopoiesis, but the precise developmental stages in which C/EBPalpha is required are unknown . 'Steady-state' granulopsis is absolutely dependent on the C/ EBPalpha transcription factor .
- The transcription factor CCAAT/enhancer binding protein β (C/EBPβ) plays critical roles in the differentiation and proliferation of hematopoietic stem cells. It is a transcription factor required for emergency granulopoiesis.
- Differentiation and proliferation of hematopoietic stem cells are regulated by C/EBPβ, a transcription factor required for emergency granulopoiesis. Granulopoiesis during emergency situations, such as infection, is dependent on C/EBPβ.
- These data suggest a critical function for C/EBPbeta in emergency granulopoiesis, which demands both differentiation and proliferation of granulocyte precursors.
- The transcription factor CCAAT/enhancer binding protein β (C/EBPβ) plays critical roles in the differentiation and proliferation of hematopoietic stem cells. There is no definitive role of the transcription factor in emergency granulopoiesis.
- The transcription factor CCAAT/enhancer binding protein β (C/EBPβ) regulates the differentiation and proliferation of hematopoietic stem cells.
