Which enzyme deficiency can cause GM1 gangliosidoses?

[PMID: 10571006]
GM1 gangliosidosis and Morquio B disease are distinct disorders both clinically and biochemically yet they arise from the same beta-galactosidase enzyme deficiency. On the other hand, galactosialidosis and sialidosis share common clinical and biochemical features, yet they arise from two separate enzyme deficiencies, namely, protective protein/cathepsin A and neuraminidase, respectively. However distinct, in practice these disorders overlap both clinically and biochemically so that easy discrimination between them is sometimes difficult. The principle reason for this may be found in the fact that these three enzymes form a unique complex in lysosomes that is required for their stability and posttranslational processing. In this review, I focus mainly on the primary and secondary beta-galactosidase deficiency states and offer some hypotheses to account for differences between GM1 gangliosidosis and Morquio B disease.

alpha-Galactosidase and beta-galactosidase activities have been determined in leukocyte preparations from 100 randomly selected Chinese adults. For alpha-galactosidase, two groups with low activities were identified: group I consisted of 3 females having activities below 40% of normal, and group II consisted of 5 males and 1 female with activities about 60% of normal. Family studies suggested that these low alpha-galactosidase activities are genetically determined. Only 1 individual was found to have about 50% of normal beta-galactosidase activity; presumably he is a carrier for beta-galactosidase deficiency (GM1 gangliosidosis).

Heterogeneous patterns of biosynthesis, posttranslational processing, and degradation were demonstrated for mutant enzymes in three clinical forms of beta-galactosidase deficiency (beta-galactosidosis): juvenile GM1-gangliosidosis, adult GM1-gangliosidosis, and Morquio B disease. The precursor of the mutant enzyme in adult GM1-gangliosidosis was not phosphorylated, and only a small portion of the gene product reached the lysosomes. The enzyme in Morquio B disease was normally processed and transported to lysosomes, but its catalytic activity was low. A common gene mutation in juvenile GM1-gangliosidosis (R201C) produced an enzyme protein that did not aggregate with protective protein in the lysosome, and was rapidly degraded by thiol proteases. This abnormal turnover was similar to that for the normal but dissociated beta-galactosidase in galactosialidosis. Protease inhibitors restored the enzyme activity in fibroblasts of this clinical form. A possible therapeutic approach is discussed for this specific type of enzyme deficiency.

GM1-gangliosidosis is a genetic neurological disorder caused by mutations in the lysosomal acid beta-galactosidase gene. While its phenotypic expression is complex, it is usually classified as being of infantile, juvenile, or adult form, on the basis of age at onset, the rate of symptomatic progression, and severity of central nervous system involvement. We have analyzed the acid beta-galactosidase gene in 12 Japanese patients from nine families. The aim was to identify mutations in individual patients and then to examine possible correlation between the mutations and the clinical phenotypes. Northern blotting studies with a full-length human beta-galactosidase cDNA showed that the mRNA ranged from undetectable to substantially decreased in the infantile patients but was normal in quantity and size in all juvenile and adult patients. Four distinct missense mutations have been identified, each limited to the respective clinical forms within our small-size samples. In the infantile patient with decreased but detectable mRNA, a point mutation was found resulting in Arg49----Cys. In the infantile patient with nearly undetectable mRNA, mutation Arg457----Ter was identified. The mutation Arg201----Cys was found in all four of the juvenile patients, while all six adult patients were homozygous for the point mutation Ile51----Thr. The mutations found in the juvenile and adult patients alter restriction sites in the normal gene and thus are amendable to quick screening. The prediction that these mutations are responsible for the clinical disease was confirmed by no expression of the catalytic activity of the mutant proteins in the COS-I cell expression system.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)

Mutations in the lysosomal acid beta-galactosidase (EC 3.2.1.23) underlie two different disorders: GM1 gangliosidosis, which involves the nervous system and visceral organs to varying extents, and Morquio's syndrome type B (Morquio B disease), which is a skeletal-connective tissue disease without any CNS symptoms. This article shows that transduction of human GM1 gangliosidosis fibroblasts with retrovirus vectors encoding the human acid beta-galactosidase cDNA leads to complete correction of the enzymatic deficiency. The newly synthesized enzyme is correctly processed and targeted to the lysosomes in transduced cells. Cross-correction experiments using retrovirus-modified cells as enzyme donors showed, however, that the human enzyme is transferred at low efficiencies. Experiments using a different retrovirus vector carrying the human cDNA confirmed this observation. Transduction of human GM1 fibroblasts and mouse NIH 3T3 cells with a retrovirus vector encoding the mouse beta-galactosidase cDNA resulted in high levels of enzymatic activity. Furthermore, the mouse enzyme was found to be transferred to human cells at high efficiency. Enzyme activity measurements in medium conditioned by genetically modified cells suggest that the human beta-galactosidase enzyme is less efficiently released to the extracellular space than its mouse counterpart. This study suggests that lysosomal enzymes, contrary to the generalized perception in the field of gene therapy, may differ significantly in their properties and provides insights for design of future gene therapy interventions in acid beta-galactosidase deficiency.

Retinal abnormalities are well documented in patients with ganglioside storage diseases. The total content and distribution of retinal glycosphingolipids was studied for the first time in control mice and in Sandhoff disease (SD) and GM1 gangliosidosis mice. Light and electron microscopy of the SD and the GM1 retinas revealed storage in ganglion cells. Similar to previous findings in rat retina, GD3 was the major ganglioside in mouse retina, while GM2 and GM1 were minor species. Total ganglioside content was 44% and 40% higher in the SD and the GM1 retinas, respectively, than in the control retinas. Furthermore, GM2 and GM1 content were 11-fold and 51-fold higher in the SD and the GM1 retinas than in the control retinas, respectively. High concentrations of asialo-GM2 and asialo-GM1 were found in the SD and the GM1 retinas, respectively, but were undetectable in the control retinas. The GSL abnormalities in the SD and the GM1 retinas reflect significant reductions in beta-hexosaminidase and beta-galactosidase enzyme activities, respectively. Although electroretinograms appeared normal in the SD and the GM1 mice, visual evoked potentials were subnormal in both mutants, indicating visual impairments. Our findings present a model system for assessing retinal pathobiology and therapies for the gangliosidoses.

GM1 gangliosidosis is a genetic disease with lysosomal beta-galactosidase deficiency caused by mutations of the gene coding for this enzyme. However, apparently normal enzyme activity was found in plasma or serum from juvenile GM1 gangliosidosis patients homozygous for a mutation, R201C (201Arg-->Cys), after clotting for 30 min. This extracellular fluid finding is unusual in patients with primary and genetic deficiency of beta-galactosidase. The serum enzyme activity became relatively low only after 3 1/2-hour clotting because its increase in normal controls was not observed in these patients. beta-Galactosidase assay is not always reliable, particularly with serum or plasma as an enzyme source, for the diagnosis of hereditary beta-galactosidase deficiency, unless it is conducted under well-controlled conditions.

A female infant with early-onset GM1-gangliosidosis type I was investigated. The lymphocytes, transformed lymphocytes and cultured skin fibroblasts of the patient were demonstrated to have severe beta-D-galactosidase deficiency. The beta-D-galactosidase activities of these cells from the patient's father and mother were at the lower limit of the normal range. The oligosaccharide accumulation in urine of the patient showed the typical type I GM1-gangliosidosis pattern, but no GM1 ganglioside was detected in the patient's urine or transformed lymphocytes. The clinical features were compatible with infantile GM1-gangliosidosis. The mixture of homogenates from the cultured fibroblasts or transformed lymphocytes of the patient and controls showed no complementation of beta-D-galactosidase activity against the controls.

Review of the data is presented on the hereditary disease gangliosidosis GM1 and on the enzyme beta-galactosidose, deficiency of which is responsible for this disease. Heterogeneity of the disease and existence of various forms of beta-galactosidase are considered. Possible correlation is discussed between the defects of the enzyme forms detected and the type of the disease.

GM1-gangliosidosis is a rare neurovisceral storage disease caused by an inherited deficiency of acid beta-galactosidase. The characteristic neurological feature of type 3 (adult or chronic) GM1-gangliosidosis is usually a slowly progressive dystonia with dysarthria due to predominant involvement of basal ganglia. About 20 adult patients with this disorder have been reported in the literature. However, there are no reports of 3 brothers with type 3 GM1-gangliosidosis, and MRI findings. Case 1 (proband): A 28-year-old man was hospitalized because of facial grimace, dysarthria, and generalized dystonia. He was born after normal pregnancy and delivery. His development was normal until 3 years of age when the difficulties of speaking and walking were noticed by his parents. These neurological abnormalities progressed slowly and facial grimace and dystonic movements occurred 7 years later. He could not walk at 22 years of age. On admission, he was bedridden with marked scoliosis and subluxation of the mandibule. The communication was possible only by pointing the words written on the board. Case 2: A 33-year-old man, elder brother of case 1, showed the similar neurological features and clinical course. Slit-lamp examination revealed corneal opacities which were located in the deep stroma. Case 3: A 33-year-old man, elder brother of case 1 or case 2. At age 10-11, he noted similar symptoms as case 1 or case 2. The severity of dystonia was milder than his brothers. A diagnosis of GM1-gangliosidosis in three patients was made on the basis of the following data.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)

A sister and brother, now aged 7 and 9 years, presented with developmental arrest, gait disturbance, dementia, and a progressive myoclonic epilepsy syndrome with hyperacusis in the second year of life. Then, spastic quadriparesis led to a decerebrate state. In the absence of macular or retinal degeneration, organomegaly, and somatic-facial features suggesting mucopolysaccharidosis, the presence of hyperacusis together with sea-blue histiocytes in bone marrow biopsies and deficient beta-galactosidase activity but normal glucosidase, hexosaminidase, and neuraminidase activity on lysosomal enzyme assays constitutes the clinical-pathologic-biochemical profile of GM1 gangliosidosis type 2. This is a rare, late infantile onset, progressive gray-matter disease in which beta-galactosidase deficiency is largely localized to the brain, though it can be demonstrated in leukocytes and cultured skin fibroblasts. It must be distinguished from the Jansky-Bielschowsky presentation of neuronal ceroid lipofuscinosis, mitochondrial encephalopathy, lactic acidosis, strokelike episodes (MELAS) and myoclonic epilepsy with ragged-red fibers (MERRF) syndromes, atypical presentations of GM2 gangliosidoses (Tay-Sachs and Sandhoff's diseases), primary sialidosis (neuraminidase deficiency), galactosialidosis, and Alpers' disease.

Cerebral lipids of patients with GM1-gangliosidoses, infantile, juvenile, and chronic type which are caused by deficiency of beta-galactosidase, were examined and compared to each other. The infantile type demonstrated abnormal accumulation of GM1 and asialo-GM1 in contrast with marked decrease in such major cerebral lipids as cholesterol, phospholipids, cerebroside, and sulfatide. It was also noted that significant amounts of such unusual lipids as free fatty acids, GlcCer, LacCer, GbOse3Cer, and GbOse-4Cer plus nLcOse4Cer were found in the brain. These findings pointed out that this infantile type might accompany a severe cerebral dysgenesis with poor myelination. The juvenile type also showed marked increase in GM1 and asialo-GM1, but the decrease in cholesterol, phospholipids, cerebroside, and sulfatide was not so much as the infantile type. These findings along with the occurrence of cholesterol ester suggested that the brain caused progressive demyelination after the immature myelin appeared. An autopsized brain tissue of a male patient who was eventually diagnosed as a case of GM1-gangliosidosis chronic type after his death, showed some accumulation of GM1 and asialo-GM1 particularly in the caudate nucleus and putamen, whereas it showed moderate amounts of GM1 in apparently normal gray and white matters. It seemed that there are no abnormal cerebral lipids except for gangliosides and some neutral glycosphingolipids in the chronic type.

GM1 gangliosidosis is a lysosomal storage disorder caused by mutations in the GLB1 gene, leading to the deficiency of the enzyme β-d-galactosidase. In this study, we report molecular findings in 50 Asian Indian families with GM1 gangliosidosis. We sequenced all the exons and flanking intronic sequences of GLB1 gene. We identified 33 different mutations (20 novel and 13 previously reported). The novel mutations include 12 missense (p.M1?, p.E129Q, p.G134R, p.L236P, p.G262E, p.L297F, p.Y331C, p.G414V, p.K493N, p.L514P, p.P597L, p.T600I), four splicing (c.246-2A>G, c.397-2A>G, c.552+1G>T, c.956-2A>G), three indels (p.R22Qfs*8, p.L24Cfs*47, p.I489Qfs*4) and one nonsense mutation (p.Q452*). Most common mutations identified in this study were c.75+2InsT (14%) and p.L337P (10%). Known mutations accounted for 67% of allele frequency in our cohort of patients, suggesting that these mutations in GLB1 are recurrent across different populations. Twenty three mutations were localized in the TIM barrel domain, β-domain 1 and β-domain 2. In silico sequence and structure analysis of GLB1 reveal that all the novel mutations affect the function and structure of the protein. We hereby report on the largest series of patients with GM1 gangliosidosis and the first from India.

The gangliosidoses comprise a family of lysosomal storage diseases characterized by the accumulation of complex glycosphingolipids in the nervous system and other tissues, secondary to the deficient activity of lysosomal hydrolases or their associated activator proteins. GM1 and GM2 gangliosidosis are associated with deficiency of β-galactosidase and β-hexosaminidase respectively. All gangliosidoses are characterized by progressive neurodegeneration, the severity of which is proportional to the residual enzyme activity. The GM1 gangliosidoses are characterized by dysostosis, organomegaly and coarsening in their most severe forms, whereas children with classic infantile GM2 gangliosidosis (Tay-Sachs disease) are usually spared systemic involvement, except in the case of the Sandhoff variant, in which organomegaly may occur. Cherry-red macular spots occur in the early onset forms of the gangliosidoses, but are less frequently seen in the less severe, later onset phenotypes. Macrocephaly, an exaggerated startle response, cognitive decline, seizures, ataxia, and progressive muscular atrophy may occur in different forms of gangliosidosis. The diagnosis is made by assay of enzyme activity, and can be confirmed by mutation analysis. Carrier screening for Tay-Sachs disease has been remarkably successful in reducing the incidence of this disease in the at-risk Ashkenazi population. There are no proven disease-modifying therapies for the gangliosidoses.

Immunoelectron microscopy was performed to study the biosynthesis of lysosomal beta-galactosidase (beta-gal) in normal and mutant human fibroblasts. Using polyclonal and monoclonal antibodies we show in normal cells precursor forms of beta-gal in the rough endoplasmic reticulum (RER) and in the Golgi apparatus throughout the stack of cisternae. In the lysosomes virtually all beta-gal exists as a high molecular weight multimer of mature enzyme. In the autosomal recessive disease GM1-gangliosidosis caused by a beta-gal deficiency and in galactosialidosis, associated with a combined deficiency of lysosomal neuraminidase and beta-gal, precursor forms of the latter enzyme are found in RER, Golgi and some labeling is present at the cell surface. The lysosomes remain unlabeled, indicative for the absence of enzyme molecules in this organelle. In galactosialidosis fibroblasts also no mature beta-gal is found in the lysosomes but in these cells the presence of the monomeric form can be increased by leupeptin (inhibition of proteolysis) whereas addition of a partly purified 32 kDa "protective protein" results in the restoration of high molecular weight beta-gal multimers in the lysosomes.

GM1 gangliosidosis is a glycosphingolipid (GSL) lysosomal storage disease caused by a genetic deficiency of acid beta-galactosidase (beta-gal), the enzyme that catabolyzes GM1 within lysosomes. Accumulation of GM1 and its asialo form (GA1) occurs primarily in the brain, leading to progressive neurodegeneration and brain dysfunction. Substrate reduction therapy aims to decrease the rate of GSL biosynthesis to counterbalance the impaired rate of catabolism. The imino sugar N-butyldeoxygalactonojirimycin (NB-DGJ) is a competitive inhibitor of the ceramide-specific glucosyltransferase that catalyzes the first step in GSL biosynthesis. Neonatal C57BL/6J (B6) and beta-gal knockout (-/-) mice were injected daily from post-natal day 2 (p-2) to p-5 with either vehicle or NB-DGJ at 600 mg or 1200 mg/kg body weight. These drug concentrations significantly reduced total brain ganglioside and GM1 content in the B6 and the beta-gal (-/-) mice. Drug treatment had no significant effect on viability, body weight, brain weight, or brain water content in the B6 and beta-gal (-/-) mice. Significant elevations in neutral lipids (GA1, ceramide, and sphingomyelin) were observed in the NB-DGJ-treated beta-gal (-/-) mice, but were not associated with adverse effects. Also, NB-DGJ treatment of B6 and beta-gal (-/-) mice from p-2 to p-5 had no subsequent effect on brain ganglioside content at p-21. Our results show that NB-DGJ is effective in reducing total brain ganglioside and GM1 content at early neonatal ages. These findings suggest that substrate reduction therapy using NB-DGJ may be an effective early intervention for GM1 gangliosidosis and possibly other GSL lysosomal storage diseases.
