How many genes are imprinted in the human genome?

[PMID: 22894909]
Genomic imprinting characterizes genes with a monoallelic expression, which is dependent on the parental origin of each allele. Approximately 150 imprinted genes are known to date, in humans and mice but, though computational searches have tried to extract intrinsic characteristics of these genes to identify new ones, the existing list is probably far from being comprehensive. We used a high-throughput strategy by diverting the classical use of genotyping microarrays to compare the genotypes of mRNA/cDNA vs. genomic DNA to identify new genes presenting monoallelic expression, starting from human placental material. After filtering of data, we obtained a list of 1,082 putative candidate monoallelic SNPs located in more than one hundred candidate genes. Among these, we found known imprinted genes, such as IPW, GRB10, INPP5F and ZNF597, which contribute to validate the approach. We also explored some likely candidates of our list and identified seven new imprinted genes, including ZFAT, ZFAT-AS1, GLIS3, NTM, MAGI2, ZC3H12Cand LIN28B, four of which encode zinc finger transcription factors. They are, however, not imprinted in the mouse placenta, except for Magi2. We analyzed in more details the ZFAT gene, which is paternally expressed in the placenta (as ZFAT-AS1, a non-coding antisense RNA) but biallelic in other tissues. The ZFAT protein is expressed in endothelial cells, as well as in syncytiotrophoblasts. The expression of this gene is, moreover, downregulated in placentas from complicated pregnancies. With this work we increase by about 10% the number of known imprinted genes in humans.

Genomic imprinting is an epigenetic process in which the copy of a gene inherited from one parent (maternal or paternal) is consistently silenced or expressed at a significantly lower level than the copy from the other parent. In an effort to begin a systematic genome-wide screen for imprinted genes, we assayed differential allelic expression (DAE) at 3,877 bi-allelic protein-coding sites located in 2,625 human genes in 67 unrelated individuals using genotyping microarrays. We used the presence of both over- and under-expression of the reference allele compared to the alternate allele to identify candidate-imprinted genes. We found 61 genes with at least twofold DAE plus "flipping" of the more highly expressed allele between reference and alternate across heterozygous samples. Sixteen flipping genes were genotyped and assayed for DAE in an independent data set of lymphoblastoid cell lines from two CEPH pedigrees. We confirmed that PEG10 is paternally expressed, identified one gene (ZNF331) with multiple lines of data indicating it is imprinted, and predicted several additional imprinting candidate genes. Our findings suggest that there are at most several hundred genes in the human genome that are universally imprinted. With samples of mRNA from appropriate tissues and a collection of informative cSNPs, a genome-wide search using this methodology could expand the list of genes that undergo genomic imprinting in a tissue- or temporal-specific manner.

Dysregulation of imprinted genes, which are expressed in a parent-of-origin-specific manner, plays an important role in various human diseases, such as cancer and behavioral disorder. To date, however, fewer than 100 imprinted genes have been identified in the human genome. The recent availability of high-throughput technology makes it possible to have large-scale prediction of imprinted genes. Here we propose a Bayesian model (dsPIG) to predict imprinted genes on the basis of allelic expression observed in mRNA-Seq data of independent human tissues. Our model (dsPIG) was capable of identifying imprinted genes with high sensitivity and specificity and a low false discovery rate when the number of sequenced tissue samples was fairly large, according to simulations. By applying dsPIG to the mRNA-Seq data, we predicted 94 imprinted genes in 20 cerebellum samples and 57 imprinted genes in 9 diverse tissue samples with expected low false discovery rates. We also assessed dsPIG using previously validated imprinted and non-imprinted genes. With simulations, we further analyzed how imbalanced allelic expression of non-imprinted genes or different minor allele frequencies affected the predictions of dsPIG. Interestingly, we found that, among biallelically expressed genes, at least 18 genes expressed significantly more transcripts from one allele than the other among different individuals and tissues. With the prevalence of the mRNA-Seq technology, dsPIG has become a useful tool for analysis of allelic expression and large-scale prediction of imprinted genes. For ease of use, we have set up a web service and also provided an R package for dsPIG at http://www.shoudanliang.com/dsPIG/.

Genomic imprinting is allelic restriction of gene expression potential depending on parent of origin, maintained by epigenetic mechanisms including parent of origin-specific DNA methylation. Among approximately 70 known imprinted genes are some causing disorders affecting growth, metabolism and cancer predisposition. Some imprinting disorder patients have hypomethylation of several imprinted loci (HIL) throughout the genome and may have atypically severe clinical features. Here we used array analysis in HIL patients to define patterns of aberrant methylation throughout the genome. We developed a novel informatic pipeline capable of small sample number analysis, and profiled 10 HIL patients with two clinical presentations (Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome and neonatal diabetes) using the Illumina Infinium Human Methylation450 BeadChip array to identify candidate imprinted regions. We used robust statistical criteria to quantify DNA methylation. We detected hypomethylation at known imprinted loci, and 25 further candidate imprinted regions (nine shared between patient groups) including one in the Down syndrome critical region (WRB) and another previously associated with bipolar disorder (PPIEL). Targeted analysis of three candidate regions (NHP2L1, WRB and PPIEL) showed allelic expression, methylation patterns consistent with allelic maternal methylation and frequent hypomethylation among an additional cohort of HIL patients, including six with Silver-Russell syndrome presentations and one with pseudohypoparathyroidism 1B. This study identified novel candidate imprinted genes, revealed remarkable epigenetic convergence among clinically divergent patients, and highlights the potential of epigenomic profiling to expand our understanding of the normal methylome and its disruption in human disease.

DNA methylation is a covalent modification of the nucleotide cytosine that is stably inherited at the dinucleotide CpG by somatic cells, and 70% of CpG dinucleotides in the genome are methylated. The exception to this pattern of methylation are CpG islands, CpG-rich sequences that are protected from methylation, and generally are thought to be methylated only on the inactive X-chromosome and in tumors, as well as differentially methylated regions (DMRs) in the vicinity of imprinted genes. To identify chromosomal regions that might harbor imprinted genes, we devised a strategy for isolating a library of normally methylated CpG islands. Most of the methylated CpG islands represented high copy number dispersed repeats. However, 62 unique clones in the library were characterized, all of which were methylated and GC-rich, with a GC content >50%. Of these, 43 clones also showed a CpG(obs)/CpG(exp) >0.6, of which 30 were studied in detail. These unique methylated CpG islands mapped to 23 chromosomal regions, and 12 were differentially methylated regions in uniparental tissues of germline origin, i.e., hydatidiform moles (paternal origin) and complete ovarian teratomas (maternal origin), even though many apparently were methylated in somatic tissues. We term these sequences gDMRs, for germline differentially methylated regions. At least two gDMRs mapped near imprinted genes, HYMA1 and a novel homolog of Elongin A and Elongin A2, which we term Elongin A3. Surprisingly, 18 of the methylated CpG islands were methylated in germline tissues of both parental origins, representing a previously uncharacterized class of normally methylated CpG islands in the genome, and which we term similarly methylated regions (SMRs). These SMRs, in contrast to the gDMRs, were significantly associated with telomeric band locations (P =.0008), suggesting a potential role for SMRs in chromosome organization. At least 10 of the methylated CpG islands were on average 85% conserved between mouse and human. These sequences will provide a valuable resource in the search for novel imprinted genes, for defining the molecular substrates of the normal methylome, and for identifying novel targets for mammalian chromatin formation.

Genomic imprinting is a mechanism by which only one copy of a gene pair is expressed, and this expression is determined by the parental origin of the copy. The deregulation of imprinted genes has been implicated in a number of human diseases. The Imprinted Gene Catalogue now has more than 200 genes listed, and estimates based on mouse models suggest many more may exist in humans. Therefore, the development of methods to identify such genes is important. In this communication, we present a parametric model-based approach to analyzing arbitrary-sized pedigree data for genomic imprinting. We have modified widely used LINKAGE program to incorporate our proposed approach. In addition, our approach allows for the use of sex-specific recombinations in the analysis, which is of particular importance in a genome-wide analysis for imprinted genes. We compared our imprinting analysis approach to that implemented in the GENEHUNTER-IMPRINT program using simulation studies as well as by analyzing causal genes in Angelman's syndrome families, which are known to be imprinted. These analyses showed that the proposed approach is very powerful for detecting imprinted genes in large pedigrees.

Genomic imprinting is an epigenetic mechanism that results in monoallelic expression of genes depending on parent-of-origin of the allele. Although the conservation of genomic imprinting among mammalian species has been widely reported for many genes, there is accumulating evidence that some genes escape this conservation. Most known imprinted genes have been identified in the mouse and human, with few imprinted genes reported in cattle. Comparative analysis of genomic imprinting across mammalian species would provide a powerful tool for elucidating the mechanisms regulating the unique expression of imprinted genes. In this study we analyzed the imprinting of 22 genes in human, mouse, and cattle and found that in only 11 was imprinting conserved across the three species. In addition, we analyzed the occurrence of the sequence elements CpG islands, C + G content, tandem repeats, and retrotransposable elements in imprinted and in nonimprinted (control) cattle genes. We found that imprinted genes have a higher G + C content and more CpG islands and tandem repeats. Short interspersed nuclear elements (SINEs) were notably fewer in number in imprinted cattle genes compared to control genes, which is in agreement with previous reports for human and mouse imprinted regions. Long interspersed nuclear elements (LINEs) and long terminal repeats (LTRs) were found to be significantly underrepresented in imprinted genes compared to control genes, contrary to reports on human and mouse. Of considerable significance was the finding of highly conserved tandem repeats in nine of the genes imprinted in all three species.
