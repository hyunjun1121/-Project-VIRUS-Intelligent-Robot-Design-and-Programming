Which is the main calcium binding protein of the sarcoplasmic reticulum?

[PMID: 11058082]
Calsequestrin is the major calcium-binding protein of cardiac and skeletal muscles whose function is to sequester Ca(2+ )in the lumen of the sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR). Here we describe the identification and functional characterization of a C. elegans calsequestrin gene (csq-1). CSQ-1 shows moderate similarity (50% similarity, 30% identity) to rabbit skeletal calsequestrin. Unlike mammals, which have two different genes encoding cardiac and fast-twitch skeletal muscle isoforms, csq-1 is the only calsequestrin gene in the C. elegans genome. We show that csq-1 is highly expressed in the body-wall muscles, beginning in mid-embryogenesis and maintained through the adult stage. In body-wall muscle cells, CSQ-1 is localized to sarcoplasmic membranes surrounding sarcomeric structures, in the regions where ryanodine receptors (UNC-68) are located. Mutation in UNC-68 affects CSQ-1 localization, suggesting that the two possibly interact in vivo. Genetic analyses of chromosomal deficiency mutants deleting csq-1 show that CSQ-1 is not essential for initiation of embryonic muscle formation and contraction. Furthermore, double-stranded RNA injection resulted in animals completely lacking CSQ-1 in body-wall muscles with no observable defects in locomotion. These findings suggest that although CSQ-1 is one of the major calcium-binding proteins in the body-wall muscles of C. elegans, it is not essential for body-wall muscle formation and contraction.

1. Many biological processes that are governed by intracellular calcium signals rely on intracellular stores, which provide a reliable, controlled release of calcium into the cytoplasm. Calcium release through the ryanodine receptor (RyR), the main ion channel in the sarcoplasmic reticulum (the calcium store in muscle) is the key determinant of muscle force. 2. Calsequestrin, the main calcium buffer in the sarcoplasmic reticulum, provides a pool of calcium for release through the RyR and acts as a luminal calcium sensor for the channel via its interactions with triadin and junctin. Until recently, how calsequestrin communicated the store Ca(2+) load to the RyR remained unknown. 3. Calsequestrin 1 (skeletal calsequestrin) has been shown to both inhibit and activate the skeletal RyR1, dependent on whether it's bound to the RyR1 directly or indirectly via anchoring proteins. 4. The phosphorylation status of calsequestrin 1 is deemed important: it influences the Ca(2+) binding capacity of calsequestrin, the way in which calsequestrin 1 regulates the RyR1 and how calsequestrin 1 interacts with the key anchoring protein junctin. 5. In skeletal muscle, junctin plays a more critical role than triadin in the mechanism that controls Ca(2+) release from the sarcoplasmic reticulum. 6. The close relationship between altered expression and dysfunction of calsequestrin in several skeletal and cardiac disorders highlights the critical role that calsequestrin plays in maintaining Ca(2+) homeostasis and regulation of muscle contraction.

Mutations in human cardiac calsequestrin (CASQ2), a high-capacity calcium-binding protein located in the sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR), have recently been linked to effort-induced ventricular arrhythmia and sudden death (catecholaminergic polymorphic ventricular tachycardia). However, the precise mechanisms through which these mutations affect SR function and lead to arrhythmia are presently unknown. In this study, we explored the effect of adenoviral-directed expression of a canine CASQ2 protein carrying the catecholaminergic polymorphic ventricular tachycardia-linked mutation D307H (CASQ2(D307H)) on Ca2+ signaling in adult rat myocytes. Total CASQ2 protein levels were consistently elevated approximately 4-fold in cells infected with adenoviruses expressing either wild-type CASQ2 (CASQ2(WT)) or CASQ2(D307H). Expression of CASQ2(D307H) reduced the Ca2+ storing capacity of the SR. In addition, the amplitude, duration, and rise time of macroscopic I(Ca)-induced Ca2+ transients and of spontaneous Ca2+ sparks were reduced significantly in myocytes expressing CASQ2(D307H). Myocytes expressing CASQ2(D307H) also displayed drastic disturbances of rhythmic oscillations in [Ca2+]i and membrane potential, with signs of delayed afterdepolarizations when undergoing periodic pacing and exposed to isoproterenol. Importantly, normal rhythmic activity was restored by loading the SR with the low-affinity Ca2+ buffer, citrate. Our data suggest that the arrhythmogenic CASQ2(D307H) mutation impairs SR Ca2+ storing and release functions and destabilizes the Ca2+-induced Ca2+ release mechanism by reducing the effective Ca2+ buffering inside the SR and/or by altering the responsiveness of the Ca2+ release channel complex to luminal Ca2+. These results establish at the cellular level the pathological link between CASQ2 mutations and the predisposition to adrenergically mediated arrhythmias observed in patients carrying CASQ2 defects.

Calsequestrin (CS) is the low-affinity, high-capacity calcium binding protein segregated to the lumen of terminal cisternae (TC) of the sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR). The physiological role of CS in controlling calcium release from the SR depends on both its intrinsic properties and its localization. The mechanisms of CS targeting were investigated in skeletal muscle fibers and C2C12 myotubes, a model of SR differentiation, with four deletion mutants of epitope (hemagglutinin, HA)-tagged CS: CS-HA24NH2, CS-HA2D, CS-HA3D, and CS-HAHT, a double mutant of the NH2 terminus and domain III. As judged by immunofluorescence of transfected skeletal muscle fibers, only the double CS-HA mutant showed a homogeneous distribution at the sarcomeric I band, i.e., it did not segregate to TC. As shown by subfractionation of microsomes derived from transfected skeletal muscles, CS-HAHT was largely associated to longitudinal SR whereas CS-HA was concentrated in TC. In C2C12 myotubes, as judged by immunofluorescence, not only CS-HAHT but also CS-HA3D and CS-HA2D were not sorted to developing SR. Condensation competence, a property referable to CS oligomerization, was monitored for the several CS-HA mutants in C2C12 myoblasts, and only CS-HA3D was found able to condense. Together, the results indicate that 1) there are at least two targeting sequences at the NH2 terminus and domain III of CS, 2) SR-specific target and structural information is contained in these sequences, 3) heterologous interactions with junctional SR proteins are relevant for segregation, 4) homologous CS-CS interactions are involved in the overall targeting process, and 5) different targeting mechanisms prevail depending on the stage of SR differentiation.

Calcium signaling, intrinsic to skeletal and cardiac muscle function, is critically dependent on the amount of calcium stored within the sarcoplasmic reticulum. Calsequestrin, the main calcium buffer in the sarcoplasmic reticulum, provides a pool of calcium for release through the ryanodine receptor and acts as a luminal calcium sensor for the channel via its interactions with triadin and junctin. We examined the influence of phosphorylation of calsequestrin on its ability to store calcium, to polymerise and to regulate ryanodine receptors by binding to triadin and junctin. Our hypothesis was that these parameters might be altered by phosphorylation of threonine 353, which is located near the calcium and triadin/junctin binding sites. Although phosphorylation increased the calcium binding capacity of calsequestrin nearly 2-fold, it did not alter calsequestrin polymerisation, its binding to triadin or junctin or inhibition of ryanodine receptor activity at 1 mM luminal calcium. Phosphorylation was required for calsequestrin binding to junctin when calcium concentration was low (100 nM), and ryanodine receptors were activated by dephosphorylated calsequestrin when it bound to triadin alone. These novel data shows that phosphorylated calsequestrin is required for high capacity calcium buffering and suggest that ryanodine receptor inhibition by calsequestrin is mediated by junctin.

Calsequestrin is a calcium-binding protein known to sequester calcium accumulated in the sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR) of muscle cells during relaxation. In the present study, we used affinity-purified antibodies to chicken cardiac calsequestrin to identify a 60,000-Da calsequestrin in frog myocardium. Like previously identified cardiac calsequestrins, it is enriched in cardiac microsomes, it is enriched by biochemical procedures previously used to purify cardiac and skeletal calsequestrins, and it exhibits a pH-dependent shift in its apparent Mr on a two-dimensional gel system. Finally, the NH2-terminal amino acid sequence of this 60,000-Da immunoreactive protein purified by fast protein liquid chromatography was identical to that of rabbit skeletal and canine cardiac calsequestrin. Thus, we conclude that this protein corresponds to the calsequestrin isoform in frog ventricular muscle. Frog calsequestrin was localized in discrete foci present at the periphery but absent from the central regions of frog ventricular myocytes as determined by immunofluorescence labeling. Immunoelectron microscopic labeling demonstrated that calsequestrin was confined to the lumen of two structurally distinct regions of the SR, where it was localized in the subsarcolemmal region of the myofibers. One of these appeared to correspond to the terminal SR previously reported to be closely apposed to the sarcolemma of frog myofibers. The other region, although close to the sarcolemma, was not physically joined to it and appeared to correspond to corbular SR. It generally is believed that frog cardiac SR does not provide activator Ca2+ required for excitation-contraction coupling. However, the identification of a calsequestrin isoform very similar to mammalian cardiac calsequestrin that is confined to specialized regions of frog cardiac SR lends support to the idea that frog cardiac SR has the ability to store Ca2+ and thus function in some capacity in frog cardiac muscle contraction.

The sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR) provides feedback control required to balance the processes of calcium storage, release, and reuptake in skeletal muscle. This balance is achieved through the concerted action of three major classes of SR calcium-regulatory proteins: (1) luminal calcium-binding proteins (calsequestrin, histidine-rich calcium-binding protein, junctate, and sarcalumenin) for calcium storage; (2) SR calcium release channels (type 1 ryanodine receptor or RyR1 and IP3 receptors) for calcium release; and (3) sarco(endo)plasmic reticulum Ca2+ -ATPase (SERCA) pumps for calcium reuptake. Proper calcium storage, release, and reuptake are essential for normal skeletal muscle function. We review SR structure and function during normal skeletal muscle activity, the proteins that orchestrate calcium storage, release, and reuptake, and how phenotypically distinct muscle diseases (e.g., malignant hyperthermia, central core disease, and Brody disease) can result from subtle alterations in the activity of several key components of the SR calcium-regulatory machinery.

Calsequestrin (CASQ) is the major component of the sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR) lumen in skeletal and cardiac muscles. This calcium-binding protein localizes to the junctional SR (jSR) cisternae, where it is responsible for the storage of large amounts of Ca(2+), whereas it is usually absent, at least in its polymerized form, in the free SR. The retention of CASQ inside the jSR is due partly to its association with other jSR proteins, such as junctin and triadin, and partly to its ability to polymerize, in a high Ca(2+) environment, into an intricate gel that holds the protein in place. In this work, we shed some light on the still poorly described in situ structure of polymerized CASQ using detailed EM images from thin sections, with and without tilting, and from deep-etched rotary-shadowed replicas. The latter directly illustrate the fundamental network nature of polymerized CASQ, revealing repeated nodal points connecting short segments of the linear polymer.
