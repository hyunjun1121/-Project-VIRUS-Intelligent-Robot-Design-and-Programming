Which deficiency is the cause of restless leg syndrome?

[PMID: 19935988]
There may be a relationship between proton pump inhibitors (PPIs) and iron absorption. PPIs may decrease the amount of iron absorbed gastrointestinally specifically due to alteration of the pH in the duodenum. Restless legs syndrome (RLS) is a sensorimotor disorder that includes an urge to move legs, accompanied or caused by uncomfortable and unpleasant sensations in the legs; the urge to move begins or worsens during periods of rest or inactivity, the urge to move is partially or totally relieved by movement, and the urge is worse or only occurs at night. In the majority of the restless leg syndrome population, the sensation is deep seated, often described as being in the shin bones, and most commonly felt between the knee and ankle. It may be described as a creepy, shock-like, tense, electric, buzzing, itchy, or even numb sensation. A subpopulation of this restless leg syndrome patient population experiences restless leg syndrome associated pain (RLSAP) that has been described as a deep "achy pain." This pain has not been found to be relieved by many of the typical over the counter analgesics. Often, constant movement of the legs appears to be the only remedy, as these sensations usually appear during periods of rest. Furthermore, there appears to be an association between iron deficiency and those suffering from Restless Leg Syndrome (RLS). The authors theorize that there may be a possible correlation between PPIs and the symptoms (e.g. pain) associated with RLS. The authors propose that PPIs, such as omeprazole, may interfere with iron absorption in certain patients and that a subpopulation of patients who develop significant iron deficiency characterized by low serum ferritin levels while on PPIs may also develop RLS-like symptoms (including RLSAP). While there is no robust direct evidence to support any associations of PPIs and iron deficiency or PPIs associated with RLS-like symptoms (including RLSAP), it is hoped that this manuscript may spark research efforts on this issue.

Prior studies have suggested a common etiology involved in Tourette's syndrome and several comorbid conditions and symptomatology. Reportedly, current medications used in Tourette's syndrome have intolerable side-effects or are ineffective for many patients. After thoroughly researching the literature, I hypothesize that magnesium deficiency may be the central precipitating event and common pathway for the subsequent biochemical effects on substance P, kynurenine, NMDA receptors, and vitamin B6 that may result in the symptomatology of Tourette's syndrome and several reported comorbid conditions. These comorbid conditions and symptomatology include allergy, asthma, autism, attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, obsessive compulsive disorder, coprolalia, copropraxia, anxiety, depression, restless leg syndrome, migraine, self-injurious behavior, autoimmunity, rage, bruxism, seizure, heart arrhythmia, heightened sensitivity to sensory stimuli, and an exaggerated startle response. Common possible environmental and genetic factors are discussed, as well as biochemical mechanisms. Clinical studies to determine the medical efficacy for a comprehensive magnesium treatment option for Tourette's syndrome need to be conducted to make this relatively safe, low side-effect treatment option available to doctors and their patients.

Theories for restless legs syndrome (RLS) pathogenesis include iron deficiency, dopamine dysregulation and peripheral neuropathy. Increased prevalence of small intestinal bacterial overgrowth (SIBO) in controlled studies in RLS and case reports of post-infectious RLS suggest potential roles for inflammation and immunological alterations. A literature search for all conditions associated with RLS was performed. These included secondary RLS disorders and factors that may exacerbate RLS. All of these conditions were reviewed with respect to potential pathogenesis including reports of iron deficiency, neuropathy, SIBO, inflammation and immune changes. A condition was defined as highly-associated if there was a prevalence study that utilized an appropriate control group. Small case reports were recorded but not included as definite RLS-associated conditions. Fifty four diseases, syndromes and conditions have been reported to cause and/or exacerbate RLS. Of these, 38 have been reported to have a higher prevalence than age-matched controls, 9 have adequate sized reports and have general acceptance as RLS-associated conditions and 7 have been reported in case report form. Overall, 42 of the 47 RLS-associated conditions (89%) have also been associated with inflammatory and/or immune changes. In addition, 43% have been associated with peripheral iron deficiency, 40% with peripheral neuropathy and 32% with SIBO. Most of the remaining conditions have yet to be studied for these factors. The fact that 95% of the 38 highly-associated RLS conditions are also associated with inflammatory/immune changes suggests the possibility that RLS may be mediated or affected through these mechanisms. Inflammation can be responsible for iron deficiency and hypothetically could cause central nervous system iron deficiency-induced RLS. Alternatively, an immune reaction to gastrointestinal bacteria or other antigens may hypothetically cause RLS by a direct immunological attack on the central or peripheral nervous system.

Prior studies, all using SPECT techniques, failed to find any differences for dopamine transporter (DAT) in restless legs syndrome (RLS) subjects. The distinct pharmacokinetic properties associated with SPECT-determined DAT along with rapid biodynamic changes in DAT may, however, have missed membrane-bound DAT differences. The current studies assessed real-time DAT binding potentials (BP) in striatum of RLS patients using (11)C-methylphenidate and PET techniques. RLS medications were stopped at least 11 days prior to the PET study. Clinical severity of RLS was also assessed. PET scans were performed at 2 different times of day (starting at 08:30 and 19:30) in separate groups of subjects. The primary outcome measure was total striatal DAT BP. Thirty-six patients with primary RLS and 34 age- and gender-matched controls. RLS subjects had significantly lower DAT binding in the striatum compared to controls on both the Day and the Night scans. DAT was decreased in putamen and caudate but not the ventral striatum of RLS subjects. There were no diurnal differences in DAT for the total group or for control and RLS separately. DAT BP did not correlate with any clinical measures of RLS. The current study found a significant decrease in DAT BP in two independent studies. These results when viewed along with prior RLS SPECT and autopsy studies of DAT, and cell culture studies with iron deficiency and DAT, suggest that membrane-bound striatal DAT, but not total cellular DAT, may be decreased in RLS.

The restless legs syndrome is characterized by an unpleasant sensation in the legs which causes an imperative need to move the legs and is therefore considered to be a disorder of movement. When it appears before going to sleep, it may interfere with falling asleep and lead to a sleep-deficit. It is a clinical condition with a satisfactory treatment, and improvement of the associated sleep disorder. The etiology is unknown, sometimes it is familial. The syndrome is increasingly often diagnosed, particularly in association with iron deficiency, during pregnancy, in chronic renal failure and in patients with peripheral neuropathy. Polysomnography is not necessary, unless one suspects an associated disorder of periodic leg movements. Treatment is by dopaminergic, opiate, benzodiazepine, anticonvulsant drugs or clonidine.

Periodic limb movement disorder (PLMD) is one of the commonest neurological disorders and causes significant disability, if left untreated. However, it is rarely diagnosed in clinical practice, probably due to lack of awareness and/or lack of necessary diagnostic facilities. Restless leg syndrome (RLS), aging, pregnancy, uraemia, iron deficiency, polyneuropathy are some of the common causes of secondary PLMD. Clinical presentation, polysomnographic findings and management of six patients of PLMD have been discussed in this report.

Iron deficiency is the most common nutritional disorder affecting at least one third of world's population. Though anemia is common manifestation of iron deficiency, other effects of iron deficiency on various tissues, organs and systems are usually under recognized. Impaired brain development and cognitive, behavioural and psychomotor impairment are most worrisome manifestations of iron deficiency. Studies have demonstrated that some of these changes occurring during period of brain growth spurt (<2 years age) may be irreversible. Association of iron deficiency with febrile seizures, pica, breath holding spells, restless leg syndrome and thrombosis is increasingly being recognized. Impaired cell-mediated immunity and bactericidal function are generally noted in iron-deficient persons; however, the findings are inconsistent. Despite proven reversible functional immunological defects in vitro studies, a clinically important relationship between states of iron deficiency and susceptibility to infections remains controversial. Studies from malaria endemic regions have reported increased incidence of malaria in association with iron supplementation. These and some other aspects of iron deficiency are reviewed in this article.

Restless legs syndrome (RLS) has gradually been recognized as a cause for insomnia in adults, but there have been few reports about children with RLS in Japan. Here we described seven pediatric RLS patients. All of the parents of our patients had difficult times to make their children sleep due to irritability, restlessness, and demanding bedtime routines. All patients had asked their parents to rub their feet in bed, and it took more than half an hour to soothe them until they fell asleep. Their mothers had been exhausted from this night-time routine. However, they did not consider the routine abnormal, as it had been their habitual behavior since infancy. Some parents were too distressed or embarrassed to describe the symptoms of their child properly. Five patients had clear family history and none had obvious periodic leg movements during sleep. All patients showed low levels of ferritin and iron supplementation was effective in five cases. In the severest two cases, pramipexole, but not iron, was dramatically effective. Both patients started to show RLS symptoms in the early days of infancy, which may suggest more severe hereditary dopaminergic dysfunction. RLS does occur in childhood and pediatricians should bear it in mind as one of the differential diagnoses when seeing children who are irritated and/or having difficulty in initiating their sleep.

It is not clear which is preferred between iron supplement and a dopamine agonist in the treatment of restless legs syndrome (RLS) with iron deficiency. The efficacies of oral iron supplementation and pramipexole for treatment of RLS with low-normal serum ferritin (15-50 ng/ml) were compared. Thirty RLS patients who took either oral iron or pramipexole for 12 weeks and were followed at 2, 4, 8 and 12 weeks after treatment commencement were enrolled. Severities of RLS symptoms were assessed using the international RLS study group rating scale for severity (IRLS) at every visit. Treatment response was defined as a decrease in IRLS score of at least 50% from baseline. The 30 subjects were assigned equally to an iron or pramipexole group. At baseline, IRLS scores and serum ferritin levels were similar between these two groups. After 12 weeks, IRLS scores were lower than those at baseline in both groups (iron -9.1 ± 7.07, P < 0.001; pramipexole -8.7 ± 8.31, P = 0.001) and similar between the two groups. Changes in IRLS scores from baseline were similar between the two groups at each visit. The response rates of the groups were identical at 46.7%. Pramipexole was not different from oral iron in terms of efficacy and improvement speed in RLS patients with a low-normal serum ferritin, but response rate of either oral iron or pramipexole alone was moderate. Some proportion of RLS patients with iron deficiency might benefit from combined use of oral iron and dopamine agonists.

The first step in the management of restless legs syndrome (RLS) is to identify, and if possible to treat any condition which might cause or worsen RLS, such as iron deficiency or some drug treatments. The patients suffering from RLS should be prompted to keep a healthy sleep schedule. Drug treatment should be restricted to patients with a clear clinical diagnosis, decided on an individual basis, when the clinical impact is serious. Four drug classes are central to the treatment of RLS: dopaminergic agents, some antiepileptics, opioids, and benzodiazepines. Dopaminergic agonists are the treatment of choice, especially when daily treatment is indicated, or if the symptoms are severe. Two dopaminergic agonists are licensed in France for the treatment of RLS: ropinirole (Adartrel) and pramipexole (Sifrol). After initiation of treatment, the patients should benefit from a regular follow-up in order to evaluate the efficacy of treatment and to identify possible side-effects. Special care should be given to the detection of augmentation, a phenomenon characterized by a paradoxical worsening of the symptoms with treatment. Some particular conditions, such as RLS comorbid with renal insufficiency, during pregnancy, and in the child are discussed.

Restless legs syndrome is common in patients with multiple sclerosis but has not been reported as occurring due to an acute, inflammatory, demyelinating attack. Restless legs syndrome is known to be related to low brain iron levels. Multiple sclerosis has been associated with the abnormal accumulation of iron in the chronic, progressive phase of axonal degeneration. Iron deficiency may play a role in demyelination. This suggests that restless legs syndrome may be caused by the inflammatory, demyelinating component of multiple sclerosis rather than axonal degeneration. The author presents a case of self-limited restless legs syndrome occurring as an acute attack of multiple sclerosis, supporting the notion that inflammatory demyelination is the underlying pathophysiology of restless legs syndrome in multiple sclerosis.

Iron deficiency anemia is common in people with chronic kidney disease (CKD) and its importance in supporting erythropoiesis is unquestioned especially in those patients treated with erythropoietin. Clinical symptomatology such as fatigability, cold intolerance, failure to concentrate and poor effort intolerance is often attributed to anemia or uremia. That iron deficiency, per se, can cause these symptoms is poorly recognized. Clinical and animal studies that support the benefits of iron supplementation, independent of increasing hemoglobin, such as those on immune function, physical performance, thermoregulation, cognition, and restless leg syndrome and aluminum absorption is the subject of this narrative review.

To investigate the clinical feature of Parkinson's disease (PD) with restless leg syndrome (RLS) and the pathogenesis of RLS. We conducted a cross-sectional and control study. The case group concluded 31 PD with RLS patients, meanwhile 39 PD patients were selected as the control group. Clinical history, clinical manifestations, complications and laboratory examinations were compared respectively between the two groups. All the RLS symptoms did not appear in RLS patients until the PD symptoms came out. Significant differences were found in complications such as swallow disturbance, constipation and illusion, when we compared the two PD groups (P < 0.05). Compared with the PD or healthy group, the level of serum ferritin and the H-reflex latency of tibial nerve were significantly decreased in PD with RLS group (P < 0.05). Secondary RLS is a complication of PD. Deficiency of iron and decreased inhibition function of spinal cord may lead to the occurrence of RLS in PD patients. When their motor symptoms are serious and complications are more common, PD patients are more possible to have RLS symptoms.

The pathogenesis of restless legs syndrome (RLS) is unknown. Although iron deficiency anemia (IDA) is related with RLS, the mechanism of this relationship is still unknown. Therefore, we decided to examine some neurophysiological parameters that reflect the function of brainstem, spinal cord and peripheral nervous system. 34 patients diagnosed with IDA at the hematology department were questioned with a structured battery for RLS and additional symptoms. Of those, 14 patients had symptoms of RLS, while remaining 20 had no signs of this disorder. In both groups, electrophysiological examination including motor and sensory nerve conduction, F-responses, H-reflex, blink-reflex, and mixed nerve silent periods was performed. Neurological examination of all patients was normal. The two groups were identical for age and sex, and the difference between both groups concerning motor and sensory nerve conduction, F-wave, H-reflex, blink-reflex, and mixed nerve silent periods was insignificant. Results suggest that IDA does not cause electrophysiological changes in the peripheral nerves, spinal cord and brainstem, and therefore, measurement of these parameters in IDA patients does not seem effective for the confirmation of RLS.

Restless leg syndrome (RLS) and periodic limb movement disorder (PLMD) are considered to be a continuum of a neurological sleep disorder associated with abnormal iron metabolism or deficiency. I describe a case of RLS and PLMD in a cystic fibrosis patient with iron deficiency from chronic hemoptysis. This is the first case that reports RLS and PLMD manifesting from iron deficiency caused by chronic hemoptysis in advanced cystic fibrosis lung disease.

Restless legs syndrome (RLS) is a common condition that is frequently unrecognized, misdiagnosed and poorly managed. It is characterized by uncomfortable sensations deep in the legs developing at rest that compel the person to move; symptoms are worst at night and sleep disturbance is common. RLS occurs in 7%-11% of the population in Western countries, and many such people experience troublesome symptoms. Primary RLS is familial in up to two thirds of patients. RLS may also be secondary to a number of conditions including iron deficiency, pregnancy and end-stage renal failure and, perhaps, neuropathy. Secondary RLS is most common in those presenting for the first time in later life. The pathogenesis of RLS probably involves the interplay of systemic or brain iron deficiency and impaired dopaminergic neurotransmission in the subcortex of the brain. RLS is very responsive to dopaminergic therapies. Rebound of RLS symptoms during the early morning and development of severe symptoms earlier in the day (augmentation) are problematic in those treated for a prolonged period with levodopa. Consequently, dopamine agonists have become first line treatment. Anti-convulsant medications and opioids are helpful in some patients. Correction of underlying problem wherever possible is important in the management of secondary RLS.

Restless legs syndrome (RLS) is a clinically important, common disease and should be diagnosed and treated early and adequately. At present, there have been no clinical biomarkers or methodologies that can contribute to the correct diagnosis of RLS, RLS should be diagnosed on the basis of 4 essential criteria: urge to move the legs, improvement after movement, and worsening or occurrence of symptoms in the evening and at rest. When applying the criteria, RLS mimics should be ruled out and comorbid diseases should be taken into account. The origin and pathogenesis of RLS are still under investigation; however, iron deficiency in the brain has been observed on imaging and cerebrospinal fluid analyses of patients with RLS. In contrast, the results of neuroimaging studies evaluating brain dopaminergic functions in patients with RLS have yielded inconclusive results, although involvement of the hypothalamus (A11) is thought to cause impaired dopaminergic modulation in the dorsal horn and intermediolateral nucleus, resulting in the restlessness of legs.

The ubiquitously expressed iron storage protein ferritin plays a central role in maintaining cellular iron homeostasis. Cytosolic ferritins are composed of heavy (H) and light (L) subunits that co-assemble into a hollow spherical shell with an internal cavity where iron is stored. The ferroxidase activity of the ferritin H chain is critical to store iron in its Fe3+ oxidation state, while the L chain shows iron nucleation properties. We describe a unique case of a 23-yr-old female patient affected by a homozygous loss of function mutation in the L-ferritin gene, idiopathic generalized seizures, and atypical restless leg syndrome (RLS). We show that L chain ferritin is undetectable in primary fibroblasts from the patient, and thus ferritin consists only of H chains. Increased iron incorporation into the FtH homopolymer leads to reduced cellular iron availability, diminished levels of cytosolic catalase, SOD1 protein levels, enhanced ROS production and higher levels of oxidized proteins. Importantly, key phenotypic features observed in fibroblasts are also mirrored in reprogrammed neurons from the patient's fibroblasts. Our results demonstrate for the first time the pathophysiological consequences of L-ferritin deficiency in a human and help to define the concept for a new disease entity hallmarked by idiopathic generalized seizure and atypical RLS.

Iron is the most important transitional metal in the body, as it is implicated in many metabolic processes, mostly related to its capacity as an electron donor/acceptor. Iron deficiency has been long been known to cause anaemia, iron excess to cause haemochromatosis. As excess free iron can cause oxidative damage, it is important that the levels of iron in the body are tightly regulated which appears to be done only by digestive absorption, as there is no known regulating mechanism for elimination of iron. The amount of free iron is also kept to a minimum thanks to binding to transferrin for transport, and to ferritin for storage. Recent research has put emphasis on the possible role of excess iron in the brain in several degenerative diseases. Iron deficiency in the central nervous system is known to cause motor impairment and cognitive deficits; more recently, it has been suggested that it may play a role in the pathophysiology of the restless leg syndrome. 2001 Harcourt Publishers Ltd

The present paper reports biochemical and neurophysiological investigations in ten cases with restless leg syndrome. Other neuropsychiatric affections and factors which could generate the symptomatology of restless legs syndrome were not included. The EEG recordings demonstrated evident reticular neuronal hypersynchrony generated by hyperpnoea (sinusoidal slow waves). The classical EEG investigations pointed out neuromuscular hyperexcitability, but some modifications of the functional parameters of the neuromuscular excitability and conductibility (signs of neuropathy) were also noticed. In all the cases, continuous 8-hour polysomnographic recordings and monitorization on infrared TV screen were performed. Investigations reported: important disorders of sleep organization, agitated sleep with frequent periods of nocturnal awakenings, increase of the durations and percentages of light slow-wave sleep (LSWS) and rapid and frequent changes of various stages of LSWS, a decrease of duration and percentage of DSWS, a decrease of duration and percentage of REM sleep (as in other parasomnias caused by magnesium deficiency) and nocturnal EEG anomalies (long discharges of sinusoidal slow waves, of sharp waves and of sharp slow waves appearing in the LSWS stages with the disappearance in the REM sleep).

Restless legs syndrome is a neurological disorder characterized by an urgency to move the legs during periods of rest. Data from a variety of sources provide a compelling argument that the amount of iron in the brain is lower in individuals with restless legs syndrome compared with neurologically normal individuals. Moreover, a significant percentage of patients with restless legs syndrome are responsive to intravenous iron therapy. The mechanism underlying the decreased iron concentrations in restless legs syndrome brains is unknown. We hypothesize that the source of the brain iron deficit is at the blood-brain interface. Thus we analysed the expression of iron management proteins in the epithelial cells of the choroid plexus and the brain microvasculature in post-mortem tissues. The choroid plexus, obtained at autopsy, from 18 neurologically normal controls and 14 individuals who had primary restless legs syndrome was subjected to histochemical staining for iron and immunostaining for iron management proteins. Iron and heavy chain ferritin staining was reduced in the epithelial cells of choroid plexus in restless legs syndrome. Divalent metal transporter, ferroportin, transferrin and its receptor were upregulated in the choroid plexus in restless legs syndrome. Microvessels were isolated from the motor cortex of 11 restless legs syndrome and 14 control brains obtained at autopsy and quantitative immunoblot analyses was performed. Expression of heavy chain ferritin, transferrin and its receptor in the microvessels from restless legs syndrome was significantly decreased compared with the controls but divalent metal protein 1, ferroportin, prohepcidin, mitochondrial ferritin and light-chain ferritin remained unchanged. The presence of an iron regulatory protein was demonstrated in the brain microvasculature and the activity of this protein is decreased in restless legs syndrome; a finding similar to our earlier report in neuromelanin cells from the substantia nigra of restless legs syndrome brains. This study reveals that there are alterations in the iron management protein profile in restless legs syndrome compared with controls at the site of blood-brain interface suggesting fundamental differences in brain iron acquisition in individuals with restless legs syndrome. Furthermore, the decrease in transferrin receptor expression in the microvasculature in the presence of relative brain iron deficiency reported in restless legs syndrome brains may underlie the problems associated with brain iron acquisition in restless legs syndrome. The consistent finding of loss of iron regulatory protein activity in restless legs syndrome brain tissue further implicates this protein as a factor in the underlying cause of the iron deficiency in the restless legs syndrome brain. The data herein provide evidence for regulation of iron uptake and storage within brain microvessels that challenge the existing paradigm that the blood-brain barrier is merely a transport system.

Iron deficiency is a frequent side effect of blood donation. In recent years, several studies have described genetic variants associated with iron concentrations. However, the impact of these variants on iron levels is unknown in blood donors. Knowledge of genetic variants that predispose donors to iron deficiency would allow bleeding frequency and iron supplementation to be tailored to the individual donor. The genotypes of five specific single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in three genes that have been previously associated with iron status and/or restless leg syndrome (RLS) were investigated in two groups of female blood donors. The first group had low iron stores (serum ferritin ≤ 12 µg/L, n = 657), and the second group had normal to high iron stores (serum ferritin > 30 µg/L, n = 645). Genotype distribution for each of the SNPs was compared between the two groups. Homozygosity for the T-allele of BTBD9 rs9296249 was associated with lower serum ferritin. The odds ratio for low serum ferritin was 1.35 (95% confidence interval, 1.02-1.77; p = 0.03) when comparing donors with the TT genotype with donors with the CT genotype. A frequent polymorphism in BTBD9 was significantly associated with serum ferritin. This polymorphism has previously been associated with RLS, but not low iron stores in blood donors.

Restless leg syndrome (RLS) is a sensorimotor disorder. Clinical studies have implicated the dopaminergic system in RLS, while others have suggested that it is associated with insufficient levels of brain iron. To date, alterations in brain iron status have been demonstrated but, despite suggestions from the clinical literature, there have been no consistent findings documenting a dopaminergic abnormality in RLS brain tissue. In this study, the substantia nigra and putamen were obtained at autopsy from individuals with primary RLS and a neurologically normal control group. A quantitative profile of the dopaminergic system was obtained. Additional assays were performed on a catecholaminergic cell line and animal models of iron deficiency. RLS tissue, compared with controls, showed a significant decrease in D2R in the putamen that correlated with severity of the RLS. RLS also showed significant increases in tyrosine hydroxylase (TH) in the substantia nigra, compared with the controls, but not in the putamen. Both TH and phosphorylated (active) TH were significantly increased in both the substantia nigra and putamen. There were no significant differences in either the putamen or nigra for dopamine receptor 1, dopamine transporters or for VMAT. Significant increases in TH and phosphorylated TH were also seen in both the animal and cell models of iron insufficiency similar to that from the RLS autopsy data. For the first time, a clear indication of dopamine pathology in RLS is revealed in this autopsy study. The results suggest cellular regulation of dopamine production that closely matches the data from cellular and animal iron insufficiency models. The results are consistent with the hypothesis that a primary iron insufficiency produces a dopaminergic abnormality characterized as an overly activated dopaminergic system as part of the RLS pathology.

Iron deficiency is a common cause of anemia in patients with end stage renal disease (ESRD). Intravenous iron administration, especially in those requiring treatment with erythropoiesis stimulating agents (ESA) is an essential component of the management of anemia in ESRD patients. Iron improves hemoglobin, reduces ESA dose requirement and also has nonerythropoietic effects including improvement in physical performance, cognition and amelioration of restless leg syndrome. However, iron can promote oxidative stress, cause endothelial dysfunction, inflammation and tissue injury, and has a potential to cause progression of both CKD and cardiovascular disease. In this review, we discuss the benefits and risks associated with i.v. iron and the practical aspects of iron administration that can minimize the complications related to iron therapy in ESRD.

Insomnia has become a major public health issue in recent times. Although quality of sleep is affected by environmental, psychophysiological, and pharmacological factors, diet and nutrient intake also contribute to sleep problems. This study investigated the association between nutrient intake and co-morbid symptoms associated with sleep status among selected adults. Subjects in this study included 87 men and women aged 21-45 years. Presence of insomnia was assessed using the Insomnia Screening Questionnaire, and dietary intake was measured over three consecutive days by dietary survey. Descriptive analysis, ANOVA, and Chi-Square tests were performed to compute and interpret the data. Approximately 60% of the participants were insomniacs. People with insomnia consumed significantly lesser quantities of nutrients as compared to normal sleepers. Differences in intakes of energy, carbohydrates, folic acid, and B(12) were highly significant (P < 0.002). Further, intakes of protein, fat, and thiamine were significantly different (P < 0.021) between insomniacs and normal sleepers. The nutrient intake pattern of the insomniacs with co-morbid symptoms was quite different from that of the normal sleepers. Based on these results, it is probable that there is an association between nutrition deficiency, co-morbid symptoms, and sleep status. More studies are required to confirm these results.

Willis-Ekbom's disease (WED), formerly called restless legs syndrome, is more common in pregnant than in non-pregnant women, implying that the physiological and biochemical changes during pregnancy influence its development. During pregnancy, many hormone levels undergo significant changes, and some hormones significantly increase in activity and can interfere with other hormones. For example, the steroid hormone estradiol interferes with the neuroendocrine hormone dopamine. During pregnancy, the activity of the thyroid axis is enhanced to meet the increased demand for thyroid hormones during this state. Dopamine is a neuroendocrine hormone that diminishes the levels of thyrotropin and consequently of thyroxine, and one of the roles of the dopaminergic system is to counteract the activity of thyroid hormones. When the activity of dopamine is not sufficient to modulate thyroid hormones, WED may occur. Robust evidence in the medical literature suggests that an imbalance between thyroid hormones and the dopaminergic system underpins WED pathophysiology. In this article, we present evidence that this imbalance may also mediate transient WED during pregnancy. It is possible that the main hormonal alteration responsible for transient WED of pregnancy is the excessive modulation of dopamine release in the pituitary stalk by estradiol. The reduced quantities of dopamine then cause decreased modulation of thyrotropin, leading to enhanced thyroid axis activity and subsequent WED symptoms. Iron deficiency may also be a predisposing factor for WED during pregnancy, as it can both diminish dopamine and increase thyroid hormone.

Diurnal effects on motor control are evident in the human disease of Restless Leg Syndrome (RLS), which is purported to be linked to brain iron deficiency as well as alterations in dopaminergic systems. Thus, we explored the relationship between daily rhythms, the onset of motor dysregulation and brain iron deficiency in an animal model of iron deficiency. Male and female weanling Sprague-Dawley rats consuming control (CN) or iron-deficient (ID) diets were examined weekly for acoustic startle response (ASR) and prepulse inhibition (PPI) for a 5-week period. Iron deficiency reduced the magnitude, but not timing, of the ASR at specific time points. ASR was elevated 60% at the onset of the dark cycle relative to the median of the light cycle in male CN and ID rats. The respective elevation was 400% and 150% in female CN and ID rats during the first 2 weeks of testing. The diurnal cycle of ASR response was attenuated by 3 weeks of testing in both dietary treatment groups. PPI was not affected by iron deficiency, sex, diurnal cycle or the interaction between these factors. These results thus demonstrate that iron deficiency moderately alters ASR signaling although the inhibitory pathways of ASR do not appear to be affected.

Iron depletion is common in regular blood donors. The objective of the study was to investigate the frequency and severity of iron depletion in regular blood donors and whether IV iron is more effective than oral to avoid iron depletion and symptoms thereof, especially restless legs syndrome (RLS). One hundred and twenty blood donors with at least five previous whole blood donations were randomized to receive either IV iron sucrose (Venofer(®), RenaPharma/Vifor, Uppsala, Sweden), 200 mg, or to 20×100 mg of oral iron sulphate (Duroferon(®), GlaxoSmithKline, Stockholm, Sweden), after each blood donation during 1 year. Iron status and RLS incidence and severity were investigated. Iron status was generally poor among regular blood donors, especially in women, with a high incidence of iron depletion (>20%) and RLS (18%). The IV iron group increased storage iron to a greater extent than the oral iron group after 12 months (P=0·0043). Female donors were more responsive to IV iron sucrose compared to oral iron sulphate, particularly female donors below 50 years of age. RLS severity scores were significantly lower in the IV iron group. The two treatments were safe. Iron status is poor in regular blood donors, restless legs syndrome is common, and the routine iron supplementation is insufficient. IV iron sucrose substitutes iron loss in blood donors more efficiently compared with oral iron sulphate, especially in women. Iron substitution to blood donors should be individualized and based on P-ferritin monitoring.
