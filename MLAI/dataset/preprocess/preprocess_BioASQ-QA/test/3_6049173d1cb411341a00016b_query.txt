When is the drug Ivermectin used?

In developing countries, low-cost control and treatment programs that offer combined approaches against diseases and their vectors are certainly needed. Ivermectin (IVM) has been well known for its role in the treatment of parasitic diseases, due to its effect on glutamate-gated chloride channels. These same channels are also present in the mosquito vector, and thus, research has focused on the insecticidal effects of this drug. Possible alternative mechanisms of IVM on the physiology of mosquitoes, however, have not been sufficiently elaborated. We assessed the protease activity, lipid peroxidation, and local expression of STAT, p53, caspase-3, and Bax markers to study the effect of this antibiotic on digestion and immunity in Culex pipiens. Sugar- and blood-feeding assays were employed to investigate the potential influence of blood feeding on the dynamics of these parameters. IVM was found to have an effect on protease activity, lipid peroxidation as well as the expression of different markers investigated in this work. The focus on the detailed effect of this drug certainly opens the gate to broadening the spectrum of IVM and expanding its health and economic benefit, especially that it is relatively more affordable than other antibiotics on the market.

The aim of this study was to compare the economic revenue related to the use of low- or high-efficacy anthelmintic drugs within suppressive or strategic schemes of treatment in growing heifers. Heifers raised in a semi-intensive grazing system in southern Brazil were used. Levamisole and ivermectin were selected as the high- and the low-efficacy drugs, respectively, based on a previous efficacy test. Subsequently, these drugs were used within strategic (Strat; four times per year) or suppressive (Supp; once a month) treatment regimens in the heifers, and their liveweight and eggs per gram of feces counts were monthly evaluated during a 13-month period. The total costs of the treatments and their cost-benefit ratio in regard to liveweight gain were calculated. Final mean liveweight gains (kg) observed were 126.7 (Strat-Low), 133.6 (Supp-Low), 141.3 (Strat-High), 142.9 (Supp-High), and 125.8 (Control). Treatments with a high-efficacy drug resulted in monetary gains of US$ 19.56 (Strat-High) and US$ 14.98 (Supp-High), but Supp-Low and Strat-Low treatments caused economic losses. Total cost of the efficacy test (US$ 374.79) could be paid by the additional liveweight gain of 20 heifers from the Strat-High group. These results showed that it would be preferable not to treat the heifers against GIN if compared with treating them with a low-efficacy drug. In addition, we showed that the use of four treatments per year with a high-efficacy drug-selected by efficacy test-resulted in a profitable management to control GIN in growing heifers raised in a semi-intensive gazing system in southern Brazil.

Ivermectin is safe and widely used for treating helminth infections. It also kills arthropods feeding on treated subjects, including malaria vectors. Thus, ivermectin mass drug administration as an additional tool for malaria control is being evaluated by WHO. As in vitro data, animal experiments and epidemiological observations suggest that ivermectin has a direct effect on the liver stages of the malaria parasite, this study was designed to assess the prophylactic effect of ivermectin on Plasmodium falciparum controlled human malaria infection. A total of 4 volunteers were randomised to placebo, and 8 volunteers were randomised to receive ivermectin 0.4 mg/kg, orally, once 2 h before being experimentally infected intravenously with 3200 P. falciparum sporozoites. The primary endpoint was time to parasitaemia detected by positive thick blood smear; RT-qPCR was performed in parallel. All but one volunteer became thick blood smear positive between day 11 and day 12 after infection, and there was no significant effect of ivermectin on parasitaemia. Ivermectin - at the dose used - has no clinically relevant activity against the pre-erythrocytic stages of P. falciparum.
