IDEAL_ANSWER:
- DeSeq2 is a software for differential gene expression analysis of RNA sequencing data.
- Both TMM and DESeq2 are widely used for differential gene expression analysis.
- DeSeq2 performed differential gene expression analysis of paired-end tag sequencing data.
- DeSeq2 supports differential gene expression analysis by combining multiple sources of evidence.
- DeSeq2 enables differential gene expression analysis of multiple cellular origins.
- DesSeq2 is widely used for differential gene expression analysis.
- DESeq2 is a method for differential analysis of count data. It is used for the calculation of fold change and dispersion of RNA-seq data.
