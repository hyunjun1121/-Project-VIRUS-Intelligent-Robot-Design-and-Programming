What is another name for AZD0530?

[PMID: 23144237]
Src is a nonreceptor tyrosine kinase involved in the cross-talk and mediation of many signaling pathways that promote cell proliferation, adhesion, invasion, migration, and tumorigenesis. Increased Src activity has been reported in many types of human cancer, including gastric cancer. Therefore, this factor has been identified as a promising therapeutic target for cancer treatments, and targeting Src in gastric cancer is predicted to have potent effects. We evaluated the antitumor effect of a c-Src/Abl kinase inhibitor, saracatinib (AZD0530), alone or combined with chemotherapeutic agents in gastric cancer cell lines and a NCI-N87 xenograft model. Among 10 gastric cancer cell lines, saracatinib specifically inhibited the growth and migration/invasion of SNU216 and NCI-N87 cells. Saracatinib blocked the Src/FAK, HER family, and oncogenic signaling pathways, and it induced G(1) arrest and apoptosis in SNU216 and NCI-N87 cells. Apoptosis required induction of the proapoptotic BCL2 family member Bim. Knockdown of Bim using siRNA decreased apoptosis induced by treatment with saracatinib, suggesting that Bim has an important role in saracatinib-induced apoptosis. Saracatinib enhanced the effects of lapatinib, an EGFR/HER2 dual inhibitor, in SNU216 and NCI-N87 cells. Furthermore, combined treatment with saracatinib and 5-fluorouracil (5-FU) or cisplatin exerted synergistic effects in both saracatinib-sensitive and saracatinib-resistant cells. Consistent with our in vitro findings, cotreatment with saracatinib and 5-FU resulted in enhanced antitumor activity in the NCI-N87 xenografts. These data indicate that the inhibition of Src kinase activity by saracatinib alone or in combination with other agents can be a strategy to target gastric cancer.
