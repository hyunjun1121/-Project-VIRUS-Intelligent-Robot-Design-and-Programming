During odontogenesis, amelogenins from the preameloblasts are translocated to differentiating odontoblasts in the dental papilla, suggesting that amelogenins may be associated with odontoblast changes during development. In the present study, we have explored the effects of enamel matrix derivative (EMD) on the healing of a pulpal wound. Coronal pulp tissue of permanent maxillary premolars of miniature swine were exposed through buccal class V cavities. The exposed pulp was capped with EMD. The contralateral teeth served as controls and were capped with a calcium hydroxide paste (Dycal). The cavities were sealed with glass-ionomer cement. After 2 and 4 weeks, the histology of the teeth was analyzed. In the EMD-treated teeth, large amounts of newly formed dentin-like hard tissue with associated formative cells outlined the pulpal wound separating the cavity area from the remaining pulp tissue. Inflammatory cells were present in the wound area but not subjacent to the newly formed hard tissue. Morphometric analysis showed that the amount of hard tissue formed in EMD-treated teeth was more than twice that of the calcium-hydroxide-treated control teeth (p < 0.001), suggesting that EMD is capable of promoting reparative processes in the wounded pulp more strongly than is calcium hydroxide.

The enamel matrix derivative (EMD) has a positive effect on the proliferation of human periodontal ligament cells and the healing of periodontal tissues. The aim of this study was to evaluate the effects of EMD on the proliferation and differentiation of human dental pulp cells (hDPCs) in vitro. hDPCs were isolated from human impacted third molars and cultured in vitro. After treatment with100μg/mL EMD, the proliferation of hDPCs was determined by a cell counting kit 8 (CCK8) assay. After incubation in EMD osteogenic induction medium for 14 days, the osteogenic differentiation of hDPCs was evaluated by alkaline phosphatase (ALP) activity, alizarin staining and the expression of osteogenesis-related genes. The EMD osteogenic induction medium enhanced the proliferation of hDPCs. After osteogenic induction, EMD increased the osteogenic potential of hDPCs, as measured by alkaline phosphatase activity and calcium accumulation; the expression levels of osteogenesis-related genes, such as ALP, DSPP, BMP, and OPN were also upregulated. In addition, the expression levels of odontogenesis-related transcription factors Osterix and Runx2 were upregulated. EMD could enhance the mineralization of hDPSCs upregulated the expression of markers for odontoblast/osteoblast-like cells. Further studies are required to determine if EMD can improve pulp tissue repair and regeneration.

To characterize the hard tissue formed in human teeth experimentally pulp capped either with calcium hydroxide or with Emdogain Gel (Biora AB, Malmö, Sweden) - a derivative of enamel matrix (EMD), using two markers for dentine; dentine sialoprotein (DSP) and type 1 collagen (Col I). Affinity-purified rabbit anti-Col I and anti-DSP polyclonal antibodies were used to stain histological sections from nine pairs of contra-lateral premolars that had been experimentally pulp amputated and randomly capped with EMDgel or calcium hydroxide. Twelve weeks after the teeth had been pulp capped, they were extracted, fixed, demineralized and serially sectioned prior to immunohistochemical staining. In the calcium hydroxide treated teeth DSP was seen in the new hard tissue which formed a bridge. DSP was also seen in the newly formed hard tissue in the EMDgel-treated teeth. Proliferated pulp tissue partly filled the space initially occupied by EMDgel and DSP-stained hard tissue was observed alongside exposed dentine surfaces as well as in isolated masses within the proliferated pulp tissue, although the new hard tissue did not cover the pulp exposure. DSP staining was also seen in the cells lining the hard tissue in both groups. Col I staining was seen in the newly formed hard tissue in both groups. The new hard tissue formed after pulp capping with EMDgel or calcium hydroxide contained DSP and Col I, considered to be markers for dentine. Thus, the newly formed hard tissue can be characterized as dentine rather than unspecific hard tissue.

The aim was to review the efficacy of the enamel matrix derivative (EMD) in direct pulp capping (DPC) procedures. Databases were explored using the following keywords: 'dental', 'dentine', 'enamel matrix derivative', 'pulp capping' and 'treatment'. The inclusion criteria were: (i) original studies; (ii) human and animal studies; (iii) reference list of potentially relevant original and review articles; (iv) intervention: effect of EMD on pulp-capping procedures; and (v) articles published only in English. Eight studies (four human and four animal) were included. Among the human studies, two studies reported that EMD is a more efficient DPC procedure compared with calcium hydroxide (Ca(OH)2 ). One study reported Ca(OH)2 to be more efficient for DPC than EMD. One study reported no difference in the efficacies between EMD and Ca(OH)2 for DPC. All animal studies reported EMD to be more effective in reparative dentine formation in comparison with Ca(OH)2 . EMD can provide favourable results in DPC procedures.

Hydrogels have been widely studied as tissue engineering scaffolds over the past 2 decades because of their favorable biological properties. Recently, a new biodegradable glycol chitin-based thermoresponsive hydrogel scaffold (GC-TRS) was developed that can be easily applied as a mild viscous solution at room temperature but quickly transforms into a durable hydrogel under physiological conditions. The aim of this study was to investigate the effects of GC-TRS on the proliferation and odontogenic differentiation of colony-forming human dental pulp cells (hDPCs) in the presence of enamel matrix derivative. Glycol chitin was synthesized by N-acetylation of glycol chitosan. The morphology of the thermoresponsive hydrogel scaffold was observed by using scanning electron microscopy. The sol gel phase transition of the aqueous solution of glycol chitin was investigated by using the tilting method and rheometer studies. hDPCs were isolated based on their ability to generate clonogenic adherent cell clusters. The effect of GC-TRS and collagen on cell viability was examined by performing 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide (MTT) assay. Expression of markers for odontogenic/osteogenic differentiation (ie, dentin sialophosphoprotein, dentin matrix protein-1, osteonectin, and osteopontin) was analyzed by performing real-time polymerase chain reaction. GC-TRS exhibited a highly macroporous and well-interconnected porous structure. The polymer solution existed in a mildly viscous sol state, but it transitioned to a gel state and did not flow above approximately 37°C. Rheometer studies showed that the glycol chitin solution exhibited a fast sol gel transition approximately at body temperature. GC-TRS and collagen did not inhibit cell viability until 7 days. Dentin sialophosphoprotein and dentin matrix protein-1 were expressed by cells cultured in GC-TRS at a higher level than that in cells cultured in collagen (P < .05). In both the scaffold groups, dentin sialophosphoprotein, dentin matrix protein-1, and osteopontin messenger RNA was up-regulated significantly in EMD-treated hDPCs when compared with the nontreated cells (P < .05). GC-TRS allowed the proliferation and odontogenic differentiation of hDPCs. Furthermore, the differentiation was facilitated by EMD. These results suggest that GC-TRS has the potential to be used in tissue engineering techniques for dentin regeneration.
