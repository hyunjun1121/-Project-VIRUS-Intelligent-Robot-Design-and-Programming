What is the function of the spliceosome complex?

[PMID: 17574835]
Splicing is a crucial, ubiquitous and highly complex step in eukaryotic gene expression. The daunting complexity of the splicing reaction, although fascinating, has severely limited our understanding of its mechanistic details. Recent advances have begun to provide exciting new insights into the dynamic interactions that govern the function of the spliceosome, the multi-megadalton complex that performs splicing. An emerging paradigm is the presence of a succession of distinct conformational states, which are stabilized by an intricate network of interactions. Recent data suggest that even subtle changes in the composition of the interaction network can result in interconversion of the different conformational states, providing opportunities for regulation and proofreading of spliceosome function. Significant progress in proteomics has elucidated the protein composition of the spliceosome at different stages of assembly. Also, the increased sophistication and resolution of cryo-electron microscopy techniques, combined with high-resolution structural studies on a smaller scale, promise to create detailed images of the global structure of the spliceosome and its main components, which in turn will provide a plethora of mechanistic insights. Overall, the past two years have seen a convergence of data from different lines of research into what promises to become a holistic picture of spliceosome function.

The spliceosome machinery is composed of multimeric protein complexes that generate a diverse repertoire of mRNA through coordinated splicing of heteronuclear RNAs. While somatic mutations in spliceosome components have been discovered in several cancer types, the molecular bases and consequences of spliceosome aberrations in cancer are poorly understood. Here we report for the first time that PRPF6, a member of the tri-snRNP (small ribonucleoprotein) spliceosome complex, drives cancer proliferation by preferential splicing of genes associated with growth regulation. Inhibition of PRPF6 and other tri-snRNP complex proteins, but not other snRNP spliceosome complexes, selectively abrogated growth in cancer cells with high tri-snRNP levels. High-resolution transcriptome analyses revealed that reduced PRPF6 alters the constitutive and alternative splicing of a discrete number of genes, including an oncogenic isoform of the ZAK kinase. These findings implicate an essential role for PRPF6 in cancer via splicing of distinct growth-related gene products.

The excision of introns from nascent eukaryotic transcripts is catalyzed by the spliceosome, a highly complex and dynamic macromolecular machine composed of RNA and protein. Because of its complexity, biochemical analysis of the spliceosome has been previously limited to bulk assays in largely unfractionated cell extracts. We now report development of methodologies for studying the splicing of isolated single pre-mRNA molecules in real time. In this system, a fluorescently tagged pre-mRNA is tethered to a glass surface via its 3'-end. Splicing can be observed in Saccharomyces cerevisiae whole cell extract by monitoring loss of intron-specific fluorescence with a multi-wavelength total internal reflection fluorescence (TIRF) microscope. To prolong fluorophore lifetime, two enzyme-based O2 scavenging systems compatible with splicing were also developed. This work provides a powerful new approach for elucidating the mechanisms of spliceosome function and demonstrates the feasibility of utilizing TIRF microscopy for biochemical studies of single molecules in highly complex environments.

Spliceosomes are macro-complexes involving hundreds of proteins with many functional interactions. Spliceosome assembly belongs to the key processes that enable splicing of mRNA and modulate alternative splicing. A detailed list of factors involved in spliceosomal reactions has been assorted over the past decade, but, their functional interplay is often unknown and most of the present biological models cover only parts of the complete assembly process. It is a challenging task to build a computational model that integrates dispersed knowledge and combines a multitude of reaction schemes proposed earlier.Because for most reactions involved in spliceosome assembly kinetic parameters are not available, we propose a discrete modeling using Petri nets, through which we are enabled to get insights into the system's behavior via computation of structural and dynamic properties. In this paper, we compile and examine reactions from experimental reports that contribute to a functional spliceosome. All these reactions form a network, which describes the inventory and conditions necessary to perform the splicing process. The analysis is mainly based on system invariants. Transition invariants (T-invariants) can be interpreted as signaling routes through the network. Due to the huge number of T-invariants that arise with increasing network size and complexity, maximal common transition sets (MCTS) and T-clusters were used for further analysis. Additionally, we introduce a false color map representation, which allows a quick survey of network modules and the visual detection of single reactions or reaction sequences, which participate in more than one signaling route. We designed a structured model of spliceosome assembly, which combines the demands on a platform that i) can display involved factors and concurrent processes, ii) offers the possibility to run computational methods for knowledge extraction, and iii) is successively extendable as new insights into spliceosome function are reported by experimental reports. The network consists of 161 transitions (reactions) and 140 places (reactants). All reactions are part of at least one of the 71 T-invariants. These T-invariants define pathways, which are in good agreement with the current knowledge and known hypotheses on reaction sequences during spliceosome assembly, hence contributing to a functional spliceosome. We demonstrate that present knowledge, in particular of the initial part of the assembly process, describes parallelism and interaction of signaling routes, which indicate functional redundancy and reflect the dependency of spliceosome assembly initiation on different cellular conditions. The complexity of the network is further increased by two switches, which introduce alternative routes during A-complex formation in early spliceosome assembly and upon transition from the B-complex to the C-complex. By compiling known reactions into a complete network, the combinatorial nature of invariant computation leads to pathways that have previously not been described as connected routes, although their constituents were known. T-clusters divide the network into modules, which we interpret as building blocks in spliceosome maturation. We conclude that Petri net representations of large biological networks and system invariants, are well-suited as a means for validating the integration of experimental knowledge into a consistent model. Based on this network model, the design of further experiments is facilitated.

Splicing and alternate splicing are the two key biological processes that result in the generation of diverse transcript and protein isoforms in Plasmodium falciparum as well as in other eukaryotic organisms. Not much is known about the organization of splicing machinery and mechanisms in human malaria parasite. Present study reports the organization and assembly of Plasmodium spliceosome Sm core complex. Presence of all the seven Plasmodium Sm-like proteins in the intra-erythrocytic stages was assessed based on the protein(s) expression analysis using immuno-localization and western blotting. Localization/co-localization studies were performed by immunofluorescence analysis on thin parasite smear using laser scanning confocal microscope. Interaction studies were carried out using yeast two-hybrid analysis and validated by in vitro pull-down assays. PfPRMT5 (arginine methyl transferase) and PfSmD1 interaction analysis was performed by pull-down assays and the interacting proteins were identified by MALDI-TOF spectrometry. PfSm proteins are expressed at asexual blood stages of the parasite and show nucleo-cytoplasmic localization. Protein-protein interaction studies showed that PfSm proteins form a heptameric complex, typical of spliceosome core complex as shown in humans. Interaction of PfSMN (survival of motor neuron, tudor domain containing protein) or PfTu-TSN (Tudor domain of Tudor Staphylococcal nuclease) with PfSmD1 proteins was found to be methylation dependent. Co-localization by immunofluorescence and co-immunoprecipitation studies suggested an association between PfPRMT5 and PfSmD1, indicating the role of arginine methylation in assembly of Plasmodium spliceosome complex. Plasmodium Sm-like proteins form a heptameric ring-like structure, although the arrangement of PfSm proteins slightly differs from human splicing machinery. The data shows the interaction of PfSMN with PfSmD1 and this interaction is found to be methylation dependent. PfPRMT5 probably exists as a part of methylosome complex that may function in the cytoplasmic assembly of Sm proteins at asexual blood stages of P. falciparum.
