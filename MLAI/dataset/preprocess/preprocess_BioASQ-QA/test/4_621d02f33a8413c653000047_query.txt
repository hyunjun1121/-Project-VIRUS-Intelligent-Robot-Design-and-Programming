To explore the role of the mechanosensitive ion channel Piezo1 in the proliferation and osteogenic differentiation of human dental follicle cells (hDFCs), and its mechanism, so as to provide the basis for the use of hDFCs to achieve bone regeneration. hDFCs were obtained from fresh dental follicle tissues by enzymatic digestion, and cell phenotype and multipotential differentiation were identified. Identification of the expression of mechanosensitive ion channel Piezo1 was performed by immunofluorescence and immunohistochemistry. CCK-8 was used to determine the optimal concentration of the Piezo1 agonist, Yoda1. Then, according to the obtained results, Alizarin red staining, RT-PCR quantitative analysis and Western blot were used to further observe the osteogenic differentiation of hDFCs and its probable mechanism via Wnt/β-catenin signalling. The data were analysed by SPSS 22.0 software. The results of the concentration gradient experiments indicated that 0.5 µM Piezo1 agonist (Yoda1) enhanced the proliferation of hDFCs. Compared with the control group, a considerable number of calcium nodules showed that activating Piezo1 could promote the osteogenic differentiation of hDFCs. The relative mRNA and protein expression of Piezo1, ALP, RUNX2, OCN and BMP2 in the Piezo1 agonist group were higher than that of the control group. Furthermore, the expression of Wnt3a and β-catenin related to the classical osteogenic pathway were significantly up-regulated in the Piezo1 agonist group. Activating mechanosensitive ion channel Piezo1 with an appropriate concentration of Yoda1 has a positive effect on the proliferation and osteogenic differentiation of hDFCs. This mechanism of promoting osteogenic differentiation may be mediated by the Wnt/β-catenin pathway.

Mechanical ventilation can induce or aggravate lung injury, which is termed ventilator-induced lung injury (VILI). Piezo1 is a key element of the mechanotransduction process and can transduce mechanical signals into biological signals by mediating Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx, which in turn regulates cytoskeletal remodeling and stress alterations. We hypothesized that it plays an important role in the occurrence of VILI, and investigated the underlying mechanisms. High tidal volume mechanical ventilation and high magnitude cyclic stretch were performed on Sprague-Dawley rats, and A549 and human pulmonary microvascular endothelial cells, respectively, to establish VILI models. Immunohistochemical staining, flow cytometry, histological examination, enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, western blotting, quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction and survival curves were used to assess the effect of Piezo1 on induction of lung injury, as well as the signaling pathways involved. We observed that Piezo1 expression increased in the lungs after high tidal volume mechanical ventilation and in cyclic stretch-treated cells. Mechanistically, we observed the enhanced expression of RhoA/ROCK1 in both cyclic stretch and Yoda1-treated cells, while the deficiency or inhibition of Piezo1 dramatically antagonized RhoA/ROCK1 expression. Furthermore, blockade of RhoA/ROCK1 signaling using an inhibitor did not affect Piezo1 expression. GSMTx4 was used to inhibit Piezo1, which alleviated VILI-induced pathologic changes, water content and protein leakage in the lungs, and the induction of systemic inflammatory mediators, and improved the 7-day mortality rate in the model rats. These findings indicate that Piezo1 affects the development and progression of VILI through promotion of RhoA/ROCK1 signaling.

Mechanosensitive channels are integral membrane proteins that sense mechanical stimuli. Like most plasma membrane ion channel proteins they must pass through biosynthetic quality control in the endoplasmic reticulum that results in them reaching their destination at the plasma membrane. Here we show that N-linked glycosylation of two highly conserved asparagine residues in the 'cap' region of mechanosensitive Piezo1 channels are necessary for the mature protein to reach the plasma membrane. Both mutation of these asparagines (N2294Q/N2331Q) and treatment with an enzyme that hydrolyses N-linked oligosaccharides (PNGaseF) eliminates the fully glycosylated mature Piezo1 protein. The N-glycans in the cap are a pre-requisite for N-glycosylation in the 'propeller' regions, which are present in loops that are essential for mechanotransduction. Importantly, trafficking-defective Piezo1 variants linked to generalized lymphatic dysplasia and bicuspid aortic valve display reduced fully N-glycosylated Piezo1 protein. Thus the N-linked glycosylation status in vitro correlates with efficient membrane trafficking and will aid in determining the functional impact of Piezo1 variants of unknown significance.
