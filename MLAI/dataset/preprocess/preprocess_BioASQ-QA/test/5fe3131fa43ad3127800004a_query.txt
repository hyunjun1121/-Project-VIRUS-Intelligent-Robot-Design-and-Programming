Which cytokine molecule activates SMADs?

[PMID: 29973939]
In physiological conditions, the activity of the intestinal immune system is tightly regulated to prevent tissue-damaging reactions directed against components of the luminal flora. Various factors contribute to maintain immune homeostasis and diminished production and/or function of such molecules trigger and/or propagate detrimental signals, which can eventually lead to chronic colitis and colon cancer. One such a molecule is transforming growth factor-β1 (TGF-β1), a cytokine produced by many inflammatory and non-inflammatory cells and targeting virtually all the intestinal mucosal cell types, with the down-stream effect of activating intracellular Smad2/3 proteins and suppressing immune reactions. In patients with inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD), there is defective TGF-β1/Smad signaling due to high Smad7, an inhibitor of TGF-β1 activity. Indeed, knockdown of Smad7 with a specific antisense oligonucleotide restores endogenous TGF-β1 activity, thereby inhibiting inflammatory pathways in patients with IBD and colitic mice. Consistently, mice over-expressing Smad7 in T cells develop severe intestinal inflammation in various experimental models. Smad7 expression is also upregulated in colon cancer cells, in which such a protein controls positively intracellular pathways that sustain neoplastic cell growth and survival. We here review the role of TGF-β1 and Smad7 in intestinal immunity, inflammation, and cancer.

Since pronounced differences exist between the fetal and adult repair processes, we studied the proliferative response of skin fibroblasts from these two stages to transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-beta), a cytokine with a broad range of activities in tissue repair. Here, we present evidence that TGF-beta inhibits fetal human skin fibroblasts, while it is stimulatory for adult ones. This proliferative effect of TGF-beta was found to be concentration- dependent, but isoform-independent. Furthermore, even a transient exposure of the cells to this growth factor was sufficient to exert its stimulatory or inhibitory action. Accordingly, we have studied the immediate responses provoked by TGF-beta in major signaling pathways, and we have found that it induces a rapid activation of the SMAD pathway, i.e., phosphorylation and nuclear translocation of SMAD2, followed by dephosphorylation, most probably due to degradation by the proteasome. However, similar intensity and kinetics of this activation have been observed in both fetal and adult fibroblasts. On the other hand, curcumin, a natural product with wound healing properties that inhibits several intracellular signaling pathways, was found to completely abrogate the inhibitory effect of TGF-beta1 on human fetal skin fibroblasts, without affecting the stimulatory action on fibroblasts from adult donors. In conclusion, there is a major radical in the proliferative response of fetal and adult human skin fibroblasts to TGF-beta, possibly reflecting the different repair strategies followed in these two stages of development.

Aberrant activation of receptor tyrosine kinases (RTK) is causally linked to the pathobiological traits of glioblastoma and genesis of glioma stem-like cells (GSC), but the underlying mechanism is still unknown. Here, we show that epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) signaling regulates the proliferation, angiogenesis, and acquisition of GSC characteristics by inducing inhibitor of differentiation 3 (ID3) and ID3-regulated cytokines [GRO1 and interleukins (IL)-6 and 8] induction. We found that EGFR-mediated ID3 expression was regulated by Smad5, which was directly phosphorylated by AKT. Furthermore, ID3 alone imparted GSC features to primary astrocytes derived from Ink4a/Arf-deficient mouse, and EGFR-ID3-IL-6 signaling axis gave rise to tumor cell heterogeneity. Conversely, EGFR inhibitors suppressed EGFR-AKT-Smad5-driven induction of ID3, which led to a decrease in the tumorsphere forming ability of GSCs and U87MG cells that possess an active mutant EGFR, EGFRvIII, without obvious cytotoxic effects. However, these cells seemed to regain colonogenic ability after removal of the EGFR inhibitors. Together, the results delineate a novel integrative molecular mechanism in which the RTK-ID signaling pathway governs genesis and maintenance of GBM histopathologic features, such as GSCs-based tumor initiation, progression, and angiogenesis.

Transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-beta), a multifunctional cytokine, has been widely suggested to play a role in the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease. Supporting this, levels of TGF-beta are elevated in the cerebrospinal fluid, sera, and brain of patients with Alzheimer's disease. Since TGF-beta is neuroprotective, whereas Alzheimer's disease is typified by neurodegeneration, we speculated that defects in TGF-beta signaling might abrogate its neuroprotective properties. Consistently with an increase in TGF-beta in Alzheimer's disease, we found significant increases in phospho-Smad2, a major downstream signaling molecule of TGF-beta, in hippocampal neurons of Alzheimer's disease compared with age-matched control patients. However, in contrast to an expected nuclear localization, phosphorylated Smad2 in Alzheimer's disease was predominantly, and ectopically, found in the neuronal cytoplasm, specifically colocalized with neurofibrillary tangles and granulovacuolar degeneration. Given that a nuclear localization is required to regulate the transcription of TGF-beta target genes to afford neuroprotection, the ectopic localization of phosphorylated Smad2 suggests a defect in the Smad-mediated signaling pathway of TGF-beta in Alzheimer's disease and consequent loss of neuroprotective function.

Transforming growth factor beta (TGF-beta) and related polypeptides, including activins and bone morphogenetic proteins (BMPs), constitute the largest cytokine family, possessing fascinating features. TGF-beta and related peptides are multifunctional growth factors and they regulate many aspects of cellular processes such as proliferation, differentiation, adhesion and apoptosis. These evolutionarily conserved cytokines play an essential role in the development and homeostasis of virtually every tissue in organisms ranging from fruit flies to humans. Accordingly, inactivating mutations in several components of the TGF-beta signaling pathways have been found to cause a number of human disorders. The TGF-beta family members signal through cell surface serine/threonine kinase receptors. A family of proteins, designated as Smads (mammalian homologues of Drosophila Mad and C. elegans Sma), transduces the TGF-beta signal from cell surface to the nucleus. Upon activation, the TGF-beta type I receptor phosphorylates Smad2 and Smad3, which then form complexes with Smad4 and accumulate in the nucleus to regulate transcription of a variety of genes that encode crucial determinants of cell fate, such as cell cycle components, differentiation factors and cell adhesion molecules. Although Smad2 and Smad3 are highly homologous and share some overlapping activities, they have distinct functions and are regulated differentially. This review is primarily focused on our understanding of the similar as well as distinct function and regulation of Smad2 and Smad3 in TGF-beta signaling, their physiological roles revealed by knockout studies and their tumor suppressive functions.

A balanced immune response requires combating infectious assaults while striving to maintain quiescence towards the self. One of the central players in this process is the pleiotropic cytokine transforming growth factor-β (TGF-β), whose deficiency results in spontaneous systemic autoimmunity in mice. The dominant function of TGF-β is to regulate the peripheral immune homeostasis, particularly in the microbe-rich and antigen-rich environment of the gut. To maintain intestinal integrity, the epithelial cells, myeloid cells and lymphocytes that inhabit the gut secrete TGF-β, which acts in both paracrine and autocrine fashions to activate its signal transducers, the SMAD transcription factors. The SMAD pathway regulates the production of IgA by B cells, maintains the protective mucosal barrier and promotes the balanced differentiation of CD4(+) T cells into inflammatory T helper type 17 cells and suppressive FOXP3(+) T regulatory cells. While encounters with pathogenic microbes activate SMAD proteins to evoke a protective inflammatory immune response, SMAD activation and synergism with immunoregulatory factors such as the vitamin A metabolite retinoic acid enforce immunosuppression toward commensal microbes and innocuous food antigens. Such complementary context-dependent functions of TGF-β are achieved by the co-operation of SMAD proteins with distinct dominant transcription activators and accessory chromatin modifiers. This review highlights recent advances in unravelling the molecular basis for the multi-faceted functions of TGF-β in the gut that are dictacted by fluid orchestrations of SMADs and their myriad partners.

The stimuli inducing expression of single immunoglobulin IL-1-related receptor (SIGIRR) and the relevant regulatory mechanisms are not well defined. Transforming growth factor β1 (TGFβ1) delays internalization of neurokinin-1 receptor (NK1R) and subsequently enhances cellular signaling. This study investigated the effect of TGFβ1 on SIGIRR protein production by human M1 macrophages in response to stimulation with substance P (SP). SP caused upregulation of SIGIRR expression in a concentration-dependent manner, whereas aprepitant (an NK1R inhibitor) blunted this response. Silencing p38γMAPK or TAK-1 partially attenuated the response to SP stimulation, while TGFβ1/2/3 siRNA dramatically diminished it. SP induced much greater SIGIRR protein production than either lipopolysaccharide (a TLR4 agonist) or resiquimod (a TLR7/8 agonist). Unexpectedly, silencing of transcription factor specificity protein 1 (Sp1) led to significant upregulation of SIGIRR expression after SP stimulation, while KLF2 siRNA only partially enhanced it and Fli-1 siRNA reduced it. SP also upregulated TGFβ1 expression, along with a corresponding increase of SIGIRR protein, whereas silencing TGFβ1/2/3 blunted these responses. Sp1 siRNA or mithramycin (a gene-selective Sp1 inhibitor) significantly enhanced the expression of TGFβ1 and SIGIRR by macrophages after SP stimulation. Importantly, this effect of Sp1 siRNA on TGFβ1 and SIGIRR was blunted by siRNA for Smad2, Smad3, or Smad4, but not by TAK-1 siRNA. Next, we investigated the influence of transcription factor cross-talk on SIGIRR expression in response to SP. Co-transfection of macrophages with Sp1 siRNA and C/EBPβ or TIF1β siRNA attenuated the upregulation of SIGIRR by SP, while a combination of Sp1 siRNA and Fli-1 siRNA dramatically diminished it. In conclusion, TGFβ1 may be an intermediary between SP/NK1R activation and SIGIRR expression in Sp1 siRNA-transfected macrophages. In addition, Sp1 modulates TGFβ1/Smad signaling and negatively regulates SIGIRR protein production by macrophages after SP stimulation.

TGF-beta (Transforming Growth Factor-beta) cytokines employ Smad proteins as the intracellular mediator of signaling. Upon TGF-beta stimulation, the cytoplasmic Smads become phosphorylated and consequently accumulate in the nucleus to regulate target gene expression. The cytoplasm-to-nucleus redistribution of Smads, as well as the ability of Smads to activate or repress gene transcription, is under multiple layers of regulation by factors not limited to TGF-beta. With recent advance in the knowledge of regulatory factors impinged on Smads, we are beginning to understand the complexity in cellular responses to TGF-beta.

Activins belong to the transforming growth factor (TGF)-β family of multifunctional cytokines and signal via the activin receptors ALK4 or ALK7 to activate the SMAD2/3 pathway. In some cases, activins also signal via the bone morphogenetic protein (BMP) receptor ALK2, causing activation of the SMAD1/5/8 pathway. In this study, we aimed to dissect how activin A and activin B homodimers, and activin AB and AC heterodimers activate the two main SMAD branches. We compared the activin-induced signaling dynamics of ALK4/7-SMAD2/3 and ALK2-SMAD1/5 in a multiple myeloma cell line. Signaling via the ALK2-SMAD1/5 pathway exhibited greater differences between ligands than signaling via ALK4/ALK7-SMAD2/3. Interestingly, activin B and activin AB very potently activated SMAD1/5, resembling the activation commonly seen with BMPs. As SMAD1/5 was also activated by activins in other cell types, we propose that dual specificity is a general mechanism for activin ligands. In addition, we found that the antagonist follistatin inhibited signaling by all the tested activins, whereas the antagonist cerberus specifically inhibited activin B. Taken together, we propose that activins may be considered dual specificity TGF-β family members, critically affecting how activins may be considered and targeted clinically.

Transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-beta) is a multifunctional cytokine that induces growth arrest, tissue fibrosis, and epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) through activation of Smad and non-Smad signaling pathways. EMT is the differentiation switch by which polarized epithelial cells differentiate into contractile and motile mesenchymal cells. Cell motility and invasive capacity are activated upon EMT. Multiple transcription factors, including deltaEF1/ZEB1, SIP1/ZEB2, and Snail/SNAI1, are induced by TGF-beta-Smad signaling and play critical roles in TGF-beta-induced EMT. In addition, both non-Smad signaling activated by TGF-beta and cross-talk with other signaling pathways play important roles in induction of EMT. Of these, Ras signaling synergizes with TGF-beta-Smad signaling, and plays an important role in the induction of EMT. TGF-beta inhibitors prevent invasion and metastasis of advanced cancer through multiple mechanisms, including inhibition of EMT. The discovery of molecules that inhibit TGF-beta-induced EMT but not TGF-beta-induced growth arrest may be an ideal strategy for treatment of invasion and metastasis of cancer.

Interleukin-6 (IL-6) is a pro-inflammatory cytokine that plays an important role in the pathogenesis of inflammatory bowel disease. TGF-beta, a multifunctional cytokine, is a potent negative regulator of mucosal inflammation in the intestine. The aim of the present study is to determine possible cross-talk between IL-6 and TGF-beta signaling pathways. Model intestinal epithelial cell lines, Caco2-BBE were used. We show that TGF-beta receptor Type II is predominantly present in the basolateral membrane of intestinal epithelial cells. TGF-beta1 induces a time-dependent phosphorylation of Smad2 and co-immunoprecipitation of SMAD-2 with Smad-4 and its subsequently translocation to the nucleus. We show that pretreatment of cells with TGF-beta1 is associated with a down-regulation of IL-6 induced tyrosine phosphorylation of STAT1 and STAT3 and suppression of ICAM-1 expression. Furthermore, TGF-beta1 pretreatment resulted in a significant inhibition of IL-6 induced ICAM-1 promoter activity. TGF-beta mediated inhibition of IL-6 induced ICAM-1 expression was reversed by transfection with dominant negative Smad2 constructs. In conclusion, we show that: 1) TGF-beta receptor Type II is predominantly located on basolateral membrane and receptor stimulation activates Smad pathway; 2) TGF-beta1 down-regulates IL-6-induced tyrosine phoshorylation of STAT1 and STAT3 and ICAM-1 expression; and 3) Smad2 is required for the down-regulation of IL-6 signaling by TGF-beta. Collectively, our data demonstrate a cross-talk between TGF-beta and IL-6, and TGF-beta may play a role in the negative regulation of IL-6 signaling in intestinal epithelial cells.

Intestinal fibroblasts, the main effector cells of intestinal fibrosis, are considered to be a good target for anti‑fibrotic therapy. The aim of the present study was to examine the effects of pirfenidone (PFD) on human intestinal fibroblasts (HIFs) stimulated by transforming growth factor (TGF)‑β1 and to explore the potential mechanism. Prior to stimulation with TGF‑β1 (10 ng/ml), HIFs were treated with or without PFD (1 mg/ml). Cell proliferation was determined by Cell Counting Kit (CCK)‑8 and colony formation assays, and cell apoptosis was assessed using flow cytometry and a TUNEL assay. Reverse transcription‑quantitative polymerase chain reaction and western blotting were performed to evaluate the mRNA and protein expressions of α‑smooth muscle actin (α‑SMA), collagen I and fibronectin. The protein expression of TGF‑β1/mothers against decapentaplegic homolog (Smad) and phosphoinositide 3‑kinase (PI3K)/protein kinase B (AKT) signaling pathways was evaluated by western blotting. CCK‑8 and colony formation assays demonstrated that PFD significantly inhibited cell proliferation in HIFs stimulated with TGF‑β1. Flow cytometry and TUNEL assays revealed that PFD treatment significantly enhanced apoptosis in TGF‑β1‑stimulated HIFs. In addition, PFD markedly reduced TGF‑β1‑induced HIF activities, such as myofibroblast differentiation (α‑SMA), and collagen production (collagen I and fibronectin). These effects of PFD were mediated by the inhibition of the TGF‑β1/Smad and PI3K/AKT signaling pathways. Therefore, the present study demonstrated that PFD reduced TGF‑β1‑induced fibrogenic activities of HIFs, suggesting that PFD may be a potential therapeutic agent for intestinal fibrosis.

Transforming growth factor-β (TGF-β) is an anti-inflammatory cytokine and is expressed in the injured spinal cord. TGF-β signals through receptors to activate Smad proteins, which translocate into the nucleus. In the present study, we investigated the chronological alterations and cellular locations of the TGF-β/Smad signaling pathway following spinal cord injury (SCI) in mice. ELISA analysis showed that the concentration of interleukin-6 (IL-6) in injured spinal cords significantly increases immediately after SCI, while the concentration of TGF-β gradually increased after SCI, peaked at 2 days, and then gradually decreased. Immunohistochemical studies revealed that Smad3 was mainly expressed in neurons of the spinal cord. Phosphorylated Smad3 at the C-terminus (p-Smad3C) was stained within the motor neurons in the anterior horn, while phosphorylated Smad3 at the linker regions (p-Smad3L) was expressed in astrocytes within gray matter. These findings suggest that SCI induces gradual increases in TGF-β and induces different activation of p-Smad3C and p-Smad3L. Phosphorylated Smad3C might be involved in neuronal degeneration after SCI, and p-Smad3L may play a role in glial scar formation by astrocytes.

TGFβ is the quintessential cytokine of T cell homeostasis. TGFβ signaling is required for the efficient differentiation and maintenance of CD4(+)FOXP3(+) T cells that inhibit immune responses. Conversely, in conjunction with the inflammatory cytokine IL-6, TGFβ promotes Th17 cell differentiation. The mechanism by which TGFβ signals synergize with IL-6 to generate inflammatory versus immunosuppressive T cell subsets is unclear. TGFβ signaling activates receptor SMADs, SMAD2 and SMAD3, which associate with a variety of nuclear factors to regulate gene transcription. Defining relative contributions of distinct SMAD molecules for CD4 T cell differentiation is critical for mapping the versatile intracellular TGFβ-signaling pathways that tailor TGFβ activities to the state of host interaction with pathogens. We show here that SMAD2 is essential for Th17 cell differentiation and that it acts in part by modulating the expression of IL-6R on T cells. Although mice lacking SMAD2 specifically in T cells do not develop spontaneous lymphoproliferative autoimmunity, Smad2-deficient T cells are impaired in their response to TGFβ in vitro and in vivo, and they are more pathogenic than controls when transferred into lymphopenic mice. These results demonstrate that SMAD2 is uniquely essential for TGFβ signaling in CD4(+) T effector cell differentiation.

Transforming growth factor (TGF)-beta(1) is a pleiotropic cytokine/growth factor that is thought to play a critical role in the modulation of inflammatory events. We demonstrate that exogenous TGF-beta(1) can inhibit the expression of the proinflammatory adhesion molecule, E-selectin, in vascular endothelium exposed to inflammatory stimuli both in vitro and in vivo. This inhibitory effect occurs at the level of transcription of the E-selectin gene and is dependent on the action of Smad proteins, a class of intracellular signaling proteins involved in mediating the cellular effects of TGF-beta(1). Furthermore, we demonstrate that these Smad-mediated effects in endothelial cells result from a novel competitive interaction between Smad proteins activated by TGF-beta(1) and nuclear factor kappaB (NFkappaB) proteins activated by inflammatory stimuli (such as cytokines or bacterial lipopolysaccharide) that is mediated by the transcriptional coactivator cyclic AMP response element-binding protein (CREB)-binding protein (CBP). Augmentation of the limited amount of CBP present in endothelial cells (via overexpression) or selective disruption of Smad-CBP interactions (via a dominant negative strategy) effectively antagonizes the ability of TGF-beta(1) to block proinflammatory E-selectin expression. These data thus demonstrate a novel mechanism of interaction between TGF-beta(1)-regulated Smad proteins and NFkappaB proteins regulated by inflammatory stimuli in vascular endothelial cells. This type of signaling mechanism may play an important role in the immunomodulatory actions of this cytokine/growth factor in the cardiovascular system.

The hepatic stellate cell (HSC) is the predominant cell type responsible for excess collagen deposition during liver fibrosis. Both transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-beta), the most potent fibrogenic cytokine for HSCs, which classically activates Smad signaling, and p38 MAPK signaling have been shown to influence collagen gene expression; however, the relative contribution and mechanisms that these two signaling pathways have in regulating collagen gene expression have not been investigated. The aim of this study was to investigate the relative roles and mechanisms of both Smad and p38 MAPK signaling in alpha1(I) collagen gene expression in HSCs. Inhibiting either p38 MAPK or Smad signaling reduced alpha1(I) collagen mRNA expression in untreated or TGF-beta-treated HSCs, and when both signaling pathways were simultaneously inhibited, alpha1(I) collagen gene expression was essentially blocked. Both signaling pathways were found to independently and additively increase alpha1(I) collagen gene expression by transcriptional mechanisms. TGF-beta treatment increased alpha1(I) collagen mRNA half-life, mediated by increased stability of alpha1(I) collagen mRNA through p38 MAPK signaling but not through Smad signaling. In conclusion, both p38 MAPK and Smad signaling independently and additively regulate alpha1(I) collagen gene expression by transcriptional activation, whereas p38 MAPK and not Smad signaling increased alpha1(I) collagen mRNA stability.

The transforming growth factor-β (TGF-β) family plays major pleiotropic roles by regulating many physiological processes in development and tissue homeostasis. The TGF-β signaling pathway outcome relies on the control of the spatial and temporal expression of >500 genes, which depend on the functions of the Smad protein along with those of diverse modulators of this signaling pathway, such as transcriptional factors and cofactors. Ski (Sloan-Kettering Institute) and SnoN (Ski novel) are Smad-interacting proteins that negatively regulate the TGF-β signaling pathway by disrupting the formation of R-Smad/Smad4 complexes, as well as by inhibiting Smad association with the p300/CBP coactivators. The Ski and SnoN transcriptional cofactors recruit diverse corepressors and histone deacetylases to repress gene transcription. The TGF-β/Smad pathway and coregulators Ski and SnoN clearly regulate each other through several positive and negative feedback mechanisms. Thus, these cross-regulatory processes finely modify the TGF-β signaling outcome as they control the magnitude and duration of the TGF-β signals. As a result, any alteration in these regulatory mechanisms may lead to disease development. Therefore, the design of targeted therapies to exert tight control of the levels of negative modulators of the TGF-β pathway, such as Ski and SnoN, is critical to restore cell homeostasis under the specific pathological conditions in which these cofactors are deregulated, such as fibrosis and cancer.

Transforming growth factor beta (TGF-?), a pleiotropic cytokine, promotes cell proliferation and migration in multiple cancers, including nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC). microRNA-124 (miR-124) becomes downregulated in NPC and inhibits the tumorigenesis of this disease. However, the role of miR-124 in TGF-?-induced NPC development remains unknown. In this study, constant TGF-? stimulation repressed miR-124 expression, whereas miR-124 overexpression antagonized TGF-?-promoted NPC cell growth and migration. miR-124 overexpression decreased p-SMAD2/3, SMAD4, and p-ERK levels, indicating that ectopic miR-124 overexpression inhibited SMAD and non-SMAD pathways. Pro-oncogenic lncRNA MALAT1 was targeted by miR-124 that regulated ERK/MAPK by targeting MALAT1 independent of the SMAD signaling pathway. In conclusion, our work clarified the significant role of miR-124 in TGF-? signaling pathways independent of the SMAD signaling pathway and showed the potential of miR-124 as a new therapeutic target against NPC.

Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) is a progressive, life-threatening and interstitial lung disease with the median survival of only 3-5 years. However, due to the unclear etiology and problems in accurate diagnosis, up to now only two drugs were approved by FDA for the treatment of IPF and their outcome responses are limited. Numerous studies have shown that TGF-β is the most important cytokine in the development of pulmonary fibrosis and plays a role through its downstream signaling molecule TGF-binding receptor Smads protein. In this paper, compounds bearing 2(1H)-quinolone scaffold were designed and their anti-fibrosis effects were evaluated. Of these compounds, 20f was identified as the most active one and could inhibit TGF-β-induced collagen deposition of NRK-49F cells and mouse fibroblasts migration with comparable activity and lower cytotoxicity than nintedanib in vitro. Further mechanism studies indicated that 20f reduced the expression of fibrogenic phenotypic protein α-SMA and collagen Ⅰ by inhibiting the TGF-β/Smad dependent pathways and ERK1/2 and p38 pathways. Moreover, compared with the nintedanib, 20f (100 mg/kg/day, p.o) more effectively alleviated collagen deposition in lung tissue and delayed the destruction of lung tissue structure both in bleomycin-induced prevention and treatment mice pulmonary fibrosis models. The immunohistochemical experiments further showed that 20f could block the expression level of phosphorylated Smad3 in the lung tissue cells, which resulted in its anti-fibrosis effects in vivo. In addition, 20f demonstrated good bioavailability (F = 41.55% vs 12%, compare with nintedanib) and an appropriate elimination half-life (T<sub>1/2</sub> = 3.5 h), suggesting that 20f may be a potential drug candidate for the treatment of pulmonary fibrosis.

Nectin-like molecule-2 (Necl-2), a junction molecule, is exclusively expressed by spermatogenic cells. It mediates homophilic interaction between germ cells and heterophilic interaction between Sertoli and germ cells. Knockout studies have shown that loss of Necl-2 causes male infertility, suggesting Necl-2-based cell adhesion is crucial for spermatogenesis. Transforming growth factor-βs (TGF-βs) are crucial for regulating cell junction restructuring that are required for spermatogenesis. In the present study, we aim to investigate the mechanism on how TGF-β1 regulates Necl-2 expression to achieve timely junction restructuring in the seminiferous epithelium during spermatogenesis. We have demonstrated that TGF-β1 reduces Necl-2 mRNA and protein levels at both transcriptional and post-translational levels. Using inhibitor and clathrin shRNA, we have revealed that TGF-β1 induces Necl-2 protein degradation via clathrin-dependent endocytosis. Endocytosis assays further confirmed that TGF-β1 accelerates the internalization of Necl-2 protein to cytosol. Immunofluorescence staining also revealed that TGF-β1 effectively removes Necl-2 from cell-cell interface. In addition, TGF-β1 reduces Necl-2 mRNA via down-regulating Necl-2 promoter activity. Mutational studies coupled with knockdown experiments have shown that TGF-β1-induced Necl-2 repression requires activation of Smad proteins. EMSA and ChIP assays further confirmed that TGF-β1 promotes the binding of Smad proteins onto MyoD and CCAATa motifs in vitro and in vivo. Taken together, TGF-β1 is a potent cytokine that provides an effective mechanism in controlling Necl-2 expression in the testis via Smad-dependent gene repression and clathrin-mediated endocytosis.

In the past three years, a novel signal transduction pathway downstream of the transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-beta) superfamily receptor serine-threonine kinases has been shown to be mediated by a family of latent transcription factors called 'Smads'. These proteins mediate a short-circuited pathway in which a set of receptor-activated Smads are phosphorylated directly by the receptor kinase and then translocate to the nucleus complexed to the common mediator, Smad4, to participate in transcriptional complexes. Smads 2 and 3 mediate signals predominantly from the TGF-beta receptors. Of these, specific roles have been ascribed to Smad3 in control of chemotaxis of neutrophils and macrophages and the inhibition of Smad3 activity by the oncogene Evi-1 suggests that it may play a role in leukemogenesis. Other data, such as the induction by the inflammatory cytokine interferon-gamma of an inhibitory Smad, Smad7, which blocks the actions of Smad3, suggest that identification of the specific gene targets of Smad proteins in immune cells will provide new insight into the mechanisms of TGF-beta action on these cells.

MUC4: encodes a large transmembrane mucin that is overexpressed in pancreatic adenocarcinomas. The molecular mechanisms responsible for that altered pattern of expression are unknown. TGF-beta, a pleiotropic cytokine, regulates numerous genes involved in pancreatic carcinogenesis via activation of the Smads proteins and MUC4 promoter is rich in Smad-binding elements. Our aim was to study whether the regulation of MUC4 expression by TGF-beta in pancreatic cancer cells was strictly dependent on Smad4 activity. Three pancreatic cancer cell lines, CAPAN-1 (MUC4+/Smad4-), CAPAN-2 (MUC4+/Smad4+) and PANC-1 (MUC4-/Smad4+), were used. By RT-PCR, transfection assays and immunohistochemistry, we show that (i) both MUC4 mRNA and apomucin expression are upregulated by TGF-beta, (ii) Smad2 positively cooperates with Smad4 to activate the promoter, (iii) activation of Smad4 by exogenous TGF-beta induces Smad4 binding to the promoter, (iv) Smad7 and c-ski both inhibit activation by Smad4. When Smad4 is mutated and inactive, TGF-beta activates MUC4 expression via MAPK, PI3K and PKA signaling pathways. Absence of expression in PANC-1 cells is due to histone deacetylation. Altogether, these results indicate that upregulation of MUC4 by TGF-beta is restricted to well-differentiated pancreatic cancer cells, and point out a novel mechanism for TGF-beta as a key molecule in targeting MUC4 overexpression in pancreatic adenocarcinomas.

Cytokines of the transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-beta) superfamily transduce their signals by activating receptor-regulated Smads (R-Smads). Distinct R-Smads or combinations of R-Smads are activated by TGF-beta, activin, or bone morphogenetic proteins (BMPs). R-Smads activated by BMPs induce expression of Id proteins, which act as inhibitors of differentiation and stimulators of cell growth by inhibiting the function of basic helix-loop-helix transcription factors. In endothelial cells, TGF-beta binds to two distinct type I receptor serine-threonine kinases, ALK-5 and ALK-1; the latter activates the same R-Smads that are activated by BMP and induces synthesis of Id (inhibitor of differentiation or inhibitor of DNA binding) proteins. Growing evidence suggests that Id proteins may play crucial roles in angiogenesis, neurogenesis, and osteogenesis and act as key molecules in regulating biological responses induced by BMPs and TGF-beta.

Transforming growth factor-β (TGF-β) is an immunosuppressive cytokine that inhibits the proinflammatory functions of T cells, and it is a major factor in abrogating T cell activity against tumors. Canonical TGF-β signaling results in the activation of Smad proteins, which are transcription factors that regulate target gene expression. We found that the cell surface molecule platelet endothelial cell adhesion molecule-1 (PECAM-1) facilitated noncanonical (Smad-independent) TGF-β signaling in T cells. Subcutaneously injected tumor cells that are dependent on TGF-β-mediated suppression of immunity for growth grew more slowly in PECAM-1(-/-) mice than in their wild-type counterparts. T cells isolated from PECAM-1(-/-) mice demonstrated relative insensitivity to the TGF-β-dependent inhibition of interferon-γ (IFN-γ) production, granzyme B synthesis, and cellular proliferation. Similarly, human T cells lacking PECAM-1 demonstrated decreased sensitivity to TGF-β in a manner that was partially restored by reexpression of PECAM-1. Co-incubation of T cells with TGF-β and a T cell-activating antibody resulted in PECAM-1 phosphorylation on an immunoreceptor tyrosine-based inhibitory motif (ITIM) and the recruitment of the inhibitory Src homology 2 (SH2) domain-containing tyrosine phosphatase-2 (SHP-2). Such conditions also induced the colocalization of PECAM-1 with the TGF-β receptor complex as identified by coimmunoprecipitation, confocal microscopy, and proximity ligation assays. These studies indicate a role for PECAM-1 in enhancing the inhibitory functions of TGF-β in T cells and suggest that therapeutic targeting of the PECAM-1-TGF-β inhibitory axis represents a means to overcome TGF-β-dependent immunosuppression within the tumor microenvironment.

Transforming growth factor (TGF)-beta is a pleiotropic cytokine regulating a variety of cellular processes such as cell growth, differentiation, apoptosis, migration, cell adhesion, and immune response. In the well-understood classical TGF-beta signaling pathway, TGF-beta activates Smad signalling via its two cell surface receptors such as TbetaRII and ALK5/TbetaRI, leading to Smad-mediated transcriptional regulation. In addition, TGF-beta may also activate other signaling pathways like mitogen-activated protein kinase, PI3K, etc. The signaling of TGF-beta is finely regulated at different levels. Inhibitory Smads, including Smad6 and Smad7, are key regulators of TGF-beta/bone morphogenetic protein (BMP) signaling by negative feedback loops. They can form stable complexes with activated type I receptors and thereby blocking the phosphorylation of R-Smads, or recruit ubiquitin E3 ligases, such as Smurf1/2, resulting in the ubiquitination and degradation of the activated type I receptors. Besides, these inhibitory Smad proteins also inhibit TGF-beta/BMP signaling in the nucleus by interacting with transcriptional repressors, such as histone deacetylases, Hoxc-8, and CtBP, or disrupting the formation of the TGF-beta-induced functional Smad-DNA complexes. Smad7 is in turn regulated by different stimuli, including TGF-beta, IFN-gamma, TNF-alpha as well as ultraviolet and TPA, and mediates the crosstalk between TGF-beta and other signaling pathways. Deregulation of Smad7 expression has been associated with various human diseases, such as tissue fibrosis, inflammatory disease as well as carcinogenesis. Overexpression of Smad7 has been shown to antagonize TGF-beta-mediated fibrosis, carcinogenesis, and inflammation, suggesting a therapeutic potential of Smad7 to treat these diseases.

Liver fibrosis is a progressive pathologic process that involves deposition of excess extracellular matrix leading to distorted architecture and culminating in cirrhosis. The role of transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-beta) as a key molecule in the development and progression of hepatic fibrosis via the activation of hepatic stellate cells, among other fibroblast populations, is without controversy. We hereby show that TGF-beta1 induces an epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT) state in mature hepatocytes in vitro. EMT state was marked by significant upregulation of alpha(1)(I) collagen mRNA expression and type I collagen deposition. Similar changes were found in a "normal" mouse hepatocyte cell line (AML12), thus confirming that hepatocytes are capable of EMT changes and type I collagen synthesis. We also show that in hepatocytes in the EMT state, TGF-beta1 induces the snail-1 transcription factor and activates the Smad2/3 pathway. Evidence for a central role of the TGF-beta1/Smad pathway is further supported by the inhibition of EMT by Smad4 silencing using small interference RNA technology. In conclusion, TGF-beta1, a known pro-apoptotic cytokine in mature hepatocytes, is capable of mediating phenotypic changes and plasticity in the form of EMT, resulting in collagen deposition. Our findings support a potentially crucial role for EMT in the development and progression of hepatic fibrogenesis.

Chronic inflammation plays an important role in the initiation and progression of various human diseases including benign prostatic hyperplasia or prostate cancer. Here we show that the proinflammatory cytokine interleukin-6 (IL-6) has prosurvival effects and chronically activates the Jak2/STAT3 signalling pathway in a model of benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH-1). We demonstrate that the antiinflammatory cytokine transforming growth factor-beta1 (TGF-beta1), which also permanently activates its canonical signalling pathway through SMAD proteins in BPH-1 cells, modifies the effects of IL-6 on cell proliferation. Importantly, TGF-beta1 inhibits IL-6 signal transduction by decreasing the phosphorylation levels of STAT3. This effect is associated with decreased expression of Jak2 at both mRNA and protein levels. Moreover, we showed that TGF-beta1 inhibits IL-6-induced expression of the cancer-associated gene MUC1. These observations demonstrated a novel interaction between TGF-beta1 and IL-6 signalling and suggested another mechanism of how defects in TGF-beta signalling, frequently associated with prostate pathologies, can contribute to the disruption of tissue homeostasis.

Inflammatory immune responses play an important role in mucosal homeostasis and gut diseases. Nuclear factor κB (NF-κB), central to the proinflammatory cascade, is activated in necrotizing enterocolitis (NEC), a devastating condition of intestinal injury with extensive inflammation in premature infants. TGF-β is a strong immune suppressor and a factor in breast milk, which has been shown to be protective against NEC. In an NEC animal model, oral administration of the isoform TGF-β1 activated the downstream effector Smad2 in intestine and significantly reduced NEC incidence. In addition, TGF-β1 suppressed NF-κB activation, maintained levels of the NF-κB inhibitor IκBα in the intestinal epithelium, and systemically decreased serum levels of IL-6 and IFN-γ. The immature human fetal intestinal epithelial cell line H4 was used as a reductionistic model of the immature enterocyte to investigate mechanism. TGF-β1 pretreatment inhibited the TNF-α-induced IκBα phosphorylation that targets the IκBα protein for degradation and inhibited NF-κB activation. Chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) assays demonstrated decreased NF-κB binding to the promoters of IL-6, IL-8, and IκBα in response to TNF-α with TGF-β1 pretreatment. These TGF-β1 effects appear to be mediated through the canonical Smad pathway as silencing of the TGF-β central mediator Smad4 resulted in loss of the TGF-β1 effects. Thus, TGF-β1 is capable of eliciting anti-inflammatory effects by inhibiting NF-κB specifically in the intestinal epithelium as well as by decreasing systemic IL-6 and IFN-γ levels. Oral administration of TGF-β1 therefore can potentially be used to protect against gastrointestinal diseases.

Transforming growth factor beta (TGFbeta) controls cellular behavior in embryonic and adult tissues. TGFbeta binding to serine/threonine kinase receptors on the plasma membrane activates Smad molecules and additional signaling proteins that together regulate gene expression. In this review, mechanisms and models that aim at explaining the coordination between several components of the signaling network downstream of TGFbeta are presented. We discuss how the activity and duration of TGFbeta receptor/Smad signaling can be regulated by post-translational modifications that affect the stability of key proteins in the pathway. We highlight links between these mechanisms and human diseases, such as tissue fibrosis and cancer.

Suppressor of cytokine signaling 1 (SOCS1) is an important negative regulator for cytokines; however, the role of SOCS1 in Th17 differentiation has not been clarified. We generated T cell-specific SOCS1-deficient mice and found that these mice were extremely resistant to a Th17-dependent autoimmune disease model, experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis. SOCS1-deficient naive CD4(+) T cells were predominantly differentiated into Th1 and poorly into Th17 in vitro. These phenotypes were canceled in IFN-gamma(-/-) background, suggesting that a large amount of IFN-gamma in SOCS1-deficient T cells suppressed Th17 differentiation. IL-6 plus TGF-beta enhanced retinoic acid receptor-related orphan receptor (ROR)-gammat expression and suppressed IFN-gamma production in wild-type T cells, whereas these effects were severely impaired in SOCS1-deficient T cells. These phenotypes can be partly explained by STAT3 suppression by enhanced SOCS3 induction through hyper-STAT1 activation in SOCS1-deficient T cells. In addition, SOCS1-deficient T cells were much less sensitive to TGF-beta. Suppression of Th1 differentiation by TGF-beta was impaired in SOCS1-deficient T cells. TGF-beta-mediated Smad transcriptional activity was severely inhibited in SOCS1-deficient cells in the presence of IFN-gamma. Such impairment of TGF-beta functions were not observed in SOCS3-overexpressed cells, indicating that suppression of Smads was independent of SOCS3. Therefore, SOCS1 is necessary for Th17 differentiation by suppressing antagonistic effect of IFN-gamma on both STAT3 and Smads. Induction of SOCS3 can partly explain IFN-gamma-mediated STAT3 suppression, while other mechanism(s) will be involved in IFN-gamma-mediated Smad suppression. SOCS1-deficient T cells will be very useful to investigate the molecular mechanism for the STAT1-mediated suppression of Th17 development.

Exposure of renal mesangial cells to sphingosine 1-phosphate (S1P) leads to a rapid and transient activation of the mitogen- and stress-activated protein kinases but also the protein kinase B. Here, we show that S1P also induces phosphorylation of Smad proteins, which are members of the transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-beta) signaling device. However, Smad phosphorylation occurred more slowly with a maximal effect after 20-30 min of S1P stimulation when compared with the rapid activation of the MAPKs. Interestingly, Smad phosphorylation is increased by pertussis toxin, which is in contrast to the complete inhibition of S1P-induced MAPK phosphorylation by pertussis toxin. TGF-beta is a potent anti-inflammatory cytokine, which in mesangial cells attenuates the expression of (i) inducible nitricoxide synthase (iNOS) caused by interleukin (IL)-1beta, (ii) secreted phospholipase A(2) (sPLA(2)), and (iii) matrix metalloproteinase-9 (MMP-9). These gene products are also down-regulated by S1P in a concentration-dependent manner. Furthermore, the expression of connective tissue growth factor is enhanced by both TGF-beta(2) and S1P. These effects of S1P are not mediated by the MAPK cascade as neither pertussis toxin nor the MAPK cascade inhibitor U0126 are able to reverse this inhibition. Overexpression of the inhibitory Smad-7 or down-regulation of co-Smad-4 lead to a reversal of the blocking effect of S1P on IL-1beta-induced NO release. Moreover, down-regulating the TGF-beta receptor type II by the siRNA technique or antagonizing the S1P(3) receptor subtype with suramin abrogates S1P-stimulated Smad phosphorylation. In summary, our data show that S1P trans-activates the TGF-beta receptor and triggers activation of Smads followed by activation of connective tissue growth factor gene transcription and inhibition of IL-1beta-induced expression of iNOS, sPLA(2), and MMP-9.

The versatile cytokine transforming growth factor β (TGF-β) regulates cellular growth, differentiation, and migration during embryonic development and adult tissue homeostasis. Activation of TGF-β receptors leads to phosphorylation of Smad2 and Smad3, which oligomerize with Smad4 and accumulate in the nucleus where they recognize gene regulatory regions and orchestrate transcription. Termination of Smad-activated transcription involves Smad dephosphorylation, nuclear export, or ubiquitin-mediated degradation. In an unbiased proteomic screen, we identified poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase-1 (PARP-1) as a Smad-interacting partner. PARP-1 dissociates Smad complexes from DNA by ADP-ribosylating Smad3 and Smad4, which attenuates Smad-specific gene responses and TGF-β-induced epithelial-mesenchymal transition. Thus, our results identify ADP-ribosylation of Smad proteins by PARP-1 as a key step in controlling the strength and duration of Smad-mediated transcription.
