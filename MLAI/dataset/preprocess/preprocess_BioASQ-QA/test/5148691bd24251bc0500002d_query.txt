Cells respond to stresses such as osmotic shock and heat shock by activating stress-activated protein kinases (SAPKs), including c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) [1]. Activation of JNK requires phosphorylation of threonine and tyrosine residues in the TPY activation loop motif [2, 3] and can be reversed by the removal of either phosphate group. Numerous JNK phosphatases including dual-specificity phosphatases [4, 5], have been identified. Many stimuli activate JNK by increasing its rate of phosphorylation; however, JNK dephosphorylation is inhibited in cells after heat shock [6], suggesting that a JNK phosphatase(s) is inactivated. M3/6 is a dual-specificity phosphatase selective for JNK [7, 8]. We have previously expressed M3/6 in the mouse bone marrow cell line BAF3 in order to show that JNK activation by IL-3 is necessary for cell survival and proliferation [9]. Here we report that M3/6 dissociates from JNK and appears in an insoluble fraction after heat shock. These data identify M3/6 as a JNK phosphatase that is inactivated by heat shock and provide a molecular mechanism for the activation of JNK by heat shock.

Oxidative stress activates the c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) pathway. However, the exact mechanisms by which reactive oxygen species (ROS) activate JNK are unclear. We found that the ability of hydrogen peroxide (H(2)O(2)) to induce JNK activation varied in different cell types. Pyrrolidine dithiocarbamate (PDTC), a presumed antioxidant, induced JNK activation on its own and enhanced JNK activation by H(2)O(2) in many cell types, including Jurkat, HEK293, and LNCaP and Tsu-Pr1 prostate cancer cells. The activation of JNK by PDTC, in the presence or absence of exogenous H(2)O(2), was dependent on its chelating ability to metal ions, most likely copper ions. Despite the strong JNK-activating ability, H(2)O(2) plus PDTC did not induce significant activation of the upstream kinases, SEK1/MKK4 and MKK7. However, the JNK inactivation rate was slower in cells treated with H(2)O(2) plus PDTC compared with the rate in cells treated with ultraviolet C (UV-C). Treatment of H(2)O(2) plus PDTC significantly decreased the expression levels of a JNK phosphatase, M3/6 (also named hVH-5), but not the levels of other phosphatases (PP2A and PP4). In contrast, UV-C irradiation did not cause the down-regulation of M3/6. These results suggest that JNK activation by H(2)O(2) plus PDTC resulted from the down-regulation of JNK phosphatases. Our data also reveal a necessity to carefully evaluate the pharmacological and biochemical properties of PDTC.

Rosiglitazone, a synthetic peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-γ (PPARγ) agonist, prevents cell death after cerebral ischemia in animal models, but the underlying mechanism has not been clarified. In this study, we examined how rosiglitazone protects neurons against ischemia. Mice treated with rosiglitazone were subjected to 60 minutes of focal ischemia followed by reperfusion. Rosiglitazone reduced infarct volume after ischemia and reperfusion. We show that this neuroprotective effect was reversed with a PPARγ antagonist. Western blot analysis showed a significant increase in expression of phosphorylated stress-activated protein kinases (c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) and p38) in ischemic brain tissue. Rosiglitazone blocked this increase. Furthermore, we observed that rosiglitazone increased expression of the dual-specificity phosphatase 8 (DUSP8) protein and messenger RNA in ischemic brain tissue. Dual-specificity phosphatase 8 is a mitogen-activated protein kinase phosphatase that can dephosphorylate JNK and p38. Another key finding of the present study was that knockdown of DUSP8 in primary cultured cortical neurons that were subjected to oxygen-glucose deprivation diminished rosiglitazone's effect on downregulation of JNK phosphorylation. Thus, rosiglitazone's neuroprotective effect after ischemia is mediated by blocking JNK phosphorylation induced by ischemia via DUSP8 upregulation.

Specific outcomes upon activation of the c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) pathway critically depend on the intensity and duration of signal transmission. Dual-specificity phosphatases (DUSPs) play a very important role in these events by modulating the extent of JNK phosphorylation and activation and thus regulating cellular responses to stress. M3/6 (DUSP8) is one of the dual-specificity protein phosphatases with distinct specificity towards JNK. It has been shown that M3/6 itself is phosphorylated by JNK upon stimulation with arsenite, but the role of this phosphorylation has not been investigated. In this study, we mapped JNK-induced phosphorylation sites on M3/6 using mass spectrometry. Phosphorylated residues Ser 515, Thr 518 and Ser 520 were identified and site-directed mutagenesis was employed to investigate their role. Upon arsenite stimulation, M3/6 mutated at these sites exhibited decreased phosphorylation compared to the wild-type protein. No difference was observed in terms of the enzyme's in vitro phosphatase activity, its substrate specificity towards JNK isoforms, its interactions with JNK and the scaffold family of JNK-interacting proteins (JIPs), its stability or its subcellular localization. Interestingly, expression of M3/6 phosphorylation mutants delayed the time-course of JNK phosphorylation and activation by arsenite. We propose that phosphorylation of the M3/6 phosphatase by JNK in response to stress stimuli results in attenuation of phosphatase activity and acceleration of JNK activation.

Stress signals elicit a wide variety of cellular responses, many of which converge on the phosphorylation of JNK and p38 kinases, the activation of which has been well-characterized. How these kinases are switched off by dephosphorylation is not well understood. Here we describe how diverse cellular stresses affect differently the stability and activity of a JNK-inactivating dual-specificity threonine-tyrosine phosphatase M3/6. Both anisomycin and arsenite activate the JNK pathway and, in addition, inactivate the M3/6 phosphatase. However, while anisomycin treatment of cells leads to M3/6 protein degradation, arsenite appears to inactivate M3/6 directly. These results might have implications for the mechanism of tumour promotion by arsenic.

Polyglutamine diseases, including Huntington's disease, designate a group of nine neurodegenerative disorders characterized by the presence of a toxic polyglutamine expansion in specific target proteins. Using cell and mouse models, we have shown that expanded polyglutamine led to activation of the stress kinase JNK and the transcription factor AP-1, which are implicated in neuronal death. Polyglutamine expansion-induced stress shared common features with protein-damaging stress such as heat shock, because activation of JNK involved inhibition of JNK phosphatase activities. Indeed, expanded polyglutamine impaired the solubility of the dual-specificity JNK phosphatase M3/6. Aggregation of M3/6 by polyglutamine expansion appeared to be indirect, because M3/6 was not recruited into polyglutamine inclusions. The heat shock protein HSP70, which is known to inhibit JNK during the heat shock response, suppressed polyglutamine-mediated aggregation of M3/6 and activation of JNK. Interestingly, levels of HSP70 were down-regulated by polyglutamine expansion. We suggest that reduction of HSP70 by expanded polyglutamine is implicated in aggregation and inhibition of M3/6 and in activation of JNK and AP-1.

Mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) cascades are involved in the regulation of cellular proliferation, differentiation, survival, apoptosis, as well as in inflammatory responses. Signal intensity and duration have been recognized as crucial parameters determining MAPK signaling output. Phosphatases play a particularly important role in this respect, by tightly controlling MAPK phosphorylation and activation. M3/6 (DUSP8) is a dual-specificity phosphatase implicated in the dephosphorylation and inactivation of JNK and, to a lesser extent, p38 MAPKs and is found in a complex with these kinases, along with other pathway components, held together by scaffold proteins. The JNK family consists of three genes, giving rise to at least ten different splice variants. Some functional differences between these gene products have been demonstrated, but the underlying molecular mechanisms and the roles of individual splice variants are still incompletely understood. We have investigated the interaction of M3/6 with JNK isoforms, as well as scaffold proteins of the JNK interacting protein (JIP) family, in order to elucidate the contribution of M3/6 to the regulation of distinct JNK signaling modules. M3/6 exhibited stronger binding towards JNK1β and JNK2α isoforms and this was reflected in higher enzymatic activity towards JNK2α2 when compared to JNK1α1 in vitro. After activation of the pathway by exposure of cells to arsenite, the interaction of M3/6 with JNK1α and JNK3 was enhanced, whereas that with JNK1β or JNK2α decreased. The modulation of binding affinities was found to be independent of JNK-mediated M3/6 phosphorylation. Furthermore, arsenite treatment resulted in an inducible recruitment of M3/6 to JNK-interacting protein 3 (JIP3) scaffold complexes, while its interaction with JIP1 or JIP2 was constitutive. The presented data suggest an isoform-specific role for the M3/6 phosphatase and the dynamic targeting of M3/6 towards distinct JNK-containing signaling complexes.
