Cyclin dependent protein kinases (CDKs) have become attractive drug targets in an effort to identify effective inhibitors of the parasite Plasmodium falciparum, the causative agent of the most severe form of human malaria. We tested known CDK inhibitors for their ability to inhibit two malarial CDKs: Pfmrk and PfPK5. Many broad spectrum CDK inhibitors failed to inhibit Pfmrk suggesting that the active site differs from other CDKs in important ways. By screening compounds in the Walter Reed chemical database, we identified oxindole-based compounds as effective inhibitors of Pfmrk (IC(50) = 1.5 microM). These compounds have low cross-reactivity against PfPK5 and human CDK1 demonstrating selectivity for Pfmrk. Amino acid comparison of the active sites of Pfmrk and PfPK5 identified unique amino acid differences that may explain this selectivity and be exploited for further drug development efforts.

Plasmodium falciparum, the causative agent of the most lethal form of human malaria, relies on de novo pyrimidine biosynthesis. A gene encoding orotate phosphoribosyltransferase (OPRT), the fifth enzyme of the de novo pathway catalyzing formation of orotidine 5'-monophosphate (OMP) and pyrophosphate (PP(i)) from 5-phosphoribosyl-1-pyrophosphate (PRPP) and orotate, was identified from P. falciparum (pfOPRT). The deduced amino acid sequence for pfOPRT was compared with OPRTs from other organisms and found to be most similar to that of Escherichia coli. The catalytic residues and consensus sequences for substrate binding in the enzyme were conserved among other organisms. The pfOPRT was exceptional in that it contained a unique insertion of 20 amino acids and an amino-terminal extension of 66 amino acids, making the longest amino acid sequence (281 amino acids with a predicted molecular mass of 33kDa). The cDNA of the pfOPRT gene was cloned, sequenced and functionally expressed in soluble form. The recombinant pfOPRT was purified from the E. coli lysate by two steps, nickel metal-affinity and gel-filtration chromatography. From 1l E. coli culture, 1.2-1.5mg of pure pfOPRT was obtained. SDS-PAGE revealed that the pfOPRT had a molecular mass of 33kDa and analytical gel-filtration chromatography showed that the enzyme activity eluted at approximately 67kDa. Using dimethyl suberimidate to cross-link neighboring subunits of the pfOPRT, it was confirmed that the native enzyme exists in a dimeric form. The steady state kinetics of initial velocity and product inhibition studies indicate that the enzyme pfOPRT follows a random sequential kinetic mechanism. Compounds aimed at the pfOPRT nexus may act against the parasite through at least two mechanisms: by directly inhibiting the enzyme activity, or be processed to an inhibitor of thymidylate synthase. This study provides a working system with which to investigate new antimalarial agents targeted against P. falciparum OPRT.

Plasmodium falciparum, the causative agent of malaria, relies extensively on glycolysis coupled with homolactic fermentation during its blood-borne stages for energy production. Selective inhibitors of the parasite lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), central to NAD(+) regeneration, therefore potentially provide a route to new antimalarial drugs directed against a novel molecular target. A series of heterocyclic, azole-based compounds are described that preferentially inhibit P. falciparum LDH at sub-micromolar concentrations, typically at concentrations about 100-fold lower than required for human lactate dehydrogenase inhibition. Crystal structures show these competitive inhibitors form a network of interactions with amino acids within the active site of the enzyme, stacking alongside the nicotinamide ring of the NAD(+) cofactor. These compounds display modest activity against parasitized erythrocytes, including parasite strains with known resistance to existing anti-malarials and against Plasmodium berghei in BALB/c mice. Initial toxicity data suggest the azole derivatives have generally low cytotoxicity, and preliminary pharmoco-kinetic data show favorable bioavailability and circulation times. These encouraging results suggest that further enhancement of these structures may yield candidates suitable for consideration as new therapeutics for the treatment of malaria. In combination these studies also provide strong support for the validity of targeting the Plasmodium glycolytic pathway and, in particular, LDH in the search for novel anti-malarials.

L-Malate dehydrogenase (PfMDH) from Plasmodium falciparum, the causative agent for the most severe form of malaria, has shown remarkable similarities to L: -lactate dehydrogenase (PfLDH). PfMDH is more closely related to [LDH-like] MDHs characterized in archae and other prokaryotes. Initial sequence analysis and identification of critical amino acid residues involved in inter-subunit salt-bridge interactions predict tetrameric structure for PfMDH. The catalytically active recombinant PfMDH was characterized as a tetramer. The enzyme is localized primarily in the parasites cytosol. To gain molecular insights into PfMDH/PfLDH relationships and to understand the quaternary structure of PfMDH, dimers were generated by mutation to the potential salt-bridge interacting sites. The R183A and R214G mutations, which snapped the salt bridges between the dimers and resulted in lower dimeric state, did not affect catalytic properties of the enzyme. The mutant dimers of PfMDH were active equally as the wild-type PfMDH. The studies reveal structure of PfMDH as a dimer of dimers. The tetrameric state of PfMDH was not essential for catalytic functions of the enzyme but may be an evolutionary adaptation for cytosolic localization to support its role in NAD/NADH coupling, an important metabolic function for survival of the malaria parasite.

Hsp90 is an important cellular chaperone and attractive target for therapeutics against both cancer and infectious organisms. The Hsp90 protein from the parasite Plasmodium falciparum, the causative agent of malaria, is critical for this organism's survival; the anti-Hsp90 drug geldanamycin is toxic to P. falciparum growth. We have solved the structure of the N-terminal ATP-binding domain of P. falciparum Hsp90, which contains a principal drug-binding pocket, in both apo and ADP-bound states at 2.3 A resolution. The structure shows that P. falciparum Hsp90 is highly similar to human Hsp90, and likely binds agents such as geldanamycin in an identical manner. Our results should aid in the structural understanding of Hsp90-drug interactions in P. falciparum, and provide a scaffold for future drug-discovery efforts.

Plasmodium, the causative agent of malaria, must first infect hepatocytes to initiate a mammalian infection. Sporozoites migrate through several hepatocytes, by breaching their plasma membranes, before infection is finally established in one of them. Here we show that wounding of hepatocytes by sporozoite migration induces the secretion of hepatocyte growth factor (HGF), which renders hepatocytes susceptible to infection. Infection depends on activation of the HGF receptor, MET, by secreted HGF. The malaria parasite exploits MET not as a primary binding site, but as a mediator of signals that make the host cell susceptible to infection. HGF/MET signaling induces rearrangements of the host-cell actin cytoskeleton that are required for the early development of the parasites within hepatocytes. Our findings identify HGF and MET as potential targets for new approaches to malaria prevention.

The emergence and dissemination of drug-resistant malaria parasites represent one of the most important problems in malaria case management. Plasmodium falciparum is the causative agent of the most lethal form of human malaria. The molecular mechanisms that control the life cycle of the malaria parasite are still poorly understood. The published genome sequence (P. falciparum strain 3D7) reveals that several homologs of eukaryotic signaling proteins, such as protein kinases and phosphatases, are conserved in P. falciparum. Proteins kinases are now widely recognized as valuable drug targets in protozoan parasites. In this study, gene silencing with double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) and microarray techniques were used to study the biological function of the cAMP-dependent protein kinase catalytic subunit (PfPKAc) in the parasite erythrocytic life cycle. Treatment of parasites with PfPKAc dsRNA resulted in a marked reduction of endogenous PfPKAc mRNA associated with a compensatory decrease of PfPKAr mRNA followed by morphological changes in schizont stages and cell cycle arrest. The global effects of gene silencing were also investigated using a P. falciparum pan-genomic microarray. Transcriptomic analysis showed that the expression of 329 genes was altered in response to downregulation of PfPKAc mRNA particularly genes in specific metabolic pathways linked with merozoite invasion processes, the calcium/calmodulin signaling, and kinases network and mitochondrial functions.

Plasmodium falciparum, the most important causative agent of human malaria, undergoes antigenic variation as a means of prolonging infection and ensuring transmission between hosts. Clonal variation is observed in the surface adhesins expressed on infected erythrocytes: primarily in the PfEMP1 adhesin encoded by the large var gene family. The sirtuin PfSIR2A was the first protein discovered to have a major influence on antigenic variation in P. falciparum. In the absence of PfSIR2A, normal silencing of the variantly-expressed var gene family is partially deregulated. To thoroughly investigate the role of PfSIR2A in controlling antigenic variation, multiple independent clones of wildtype and PfSIR2A-knockout (DeltaSir2a) parasites were generated. var gene expression was then measured qualitatively, quantitatively and longitudinally over extended periods in culture. DeltaSir2a parasites were found to activate about 10 specific var genes in every independent clone analyzed. The activated genes were biased towards the upsA, upsBA and upsEvar gene subclasses. The total var transcript level was two to three-fold higher in DeltaSir2a parasites than in wildtype parasites and at least one transcript - encoding the pregnancy malaria adhesin VAR2CSA - was successfully translated and expressed on the infected cell surface. In the absence of PfSIR2A, antigenic switching over time was also diminished, although not abolished. This work expands our understanding of clonal antigenic variation in this important human pathogen and demonstrates a central role for PfSIR2A in regulating both the variant expression of specific var gene subsets and the overall quantity of var gene expression.

Toxoplasma gondii is a member of the phylum Apicomplexa that includes several important human pathogens, such as Cryptosporidium and Plasmodium falciparum, the causative agent of human malaria. It is an obligate intracellular parasite that can cause severe disease in congenitally infected neonates and immunocompromised individuals. Despite the importance of attachment and invasion to the success of the parasite, little is known about the underlying mechanisms that drive these processes. Here we describe a screen to identify small molecules that block the process of host cell invasion by the T. gondii parasite. We identified a small molecule that specifically and irreversibly blocks parasite attachment and subsequent invasion of host cells. Using tandem orthogonal proteolysis-activity-based protein profiling, we determined that this compound covalently modifies a single cysteine residue in a poorly characterized protein homologous to the human protein DJ-1. Mutation of this key cysteine residue in the native gene sequence resulted in parasites that were resistant to inhibition of host cell attachment and invasion by the compound. Further analysis of the invasion phenotype confirmed that modification of Cys127 on TgDJ-1 resulted in a block of microneme secretion and motility, even in the presence of direct stimulators of calcium release. Together, our results suggest that TgDJ-1 plays an important role that is likely downstream of the calcium flux required for microneme secretion, parasite motility, and subsequent invasion of host cells.

Plasmodium falciparum is the causative agent of malaria, a deadly infectious disease for which treatments are scarce and drug-resistant parasites are now increasingly found. A comprehensive method of identifying and quantifying metabolites of this intracellular parasite could expand the arsenal of tools to understand its biology, and be used to develop new treatments against the disease. Here, we present two methods based on liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry for reliable measurement of water-soluble metabolites involved in phospholipid biosynthesis, as well as several other metabolites that reflect the metabolic status of the parasite including amino acids, carboxylic acids, energy-related carbohydrates, and nucleotides. A total of 35 compounds was quantified. In the first method, polar compounds were retained by hydrophilic interaction chromatography (amino column) and detected in negative mode using succinic acid-(13)C(4) and fluorovaline as internal standards. In the second method, separations were carried out using reverse phase (C18) ion-pair liquid chromatography, with heptafluorobutyric acid as a volatile ion pairing reagent in positive detection mode, using d(9)-choline and 4-aminobutanol as internal standards. Standard curves were performed in P. falciparum-infected and uninfected red blood cells using standard addition method (r(2)>0.99). The intra- and inter-day accuracy and precision as well as the extraction recovery of each compound were determined. The lower limit of quantitation varied from 50pmol to 100fmol/3×10(7)cells. These methods were validated and successfully applied to determine intracellular concentrations of metabolites from uninfected host RBCs and isolated Plasmodium parasites.

The sulfonamide and sulfone (sulfa) group of antimalarials has been used extensively throughout malaria endemic regions of the world to control this important infectious disease of humans. Sulfadoxine is the most extensively used drug of this group of drugs and is usually combined with pyrimethamine (Fansidar), particularly for the control of Plasmodium falciparum, the causative agent of the most lethal form of malaria. Resistance to the sulfadoxine/pyrimethamine combination is widespread. Analysis using molecular, genetic and biochemical approaches has shown that the mechanism of resistance to sulfadoxine involves mutation of dihydropteroate synthase, the enzyme target of this group of drugs. Understanding the mechanism of resistance of P. falciparum to sulfa drugs has allowed detailed analysis of the epidemiology of the spread of drug resistance alleles in the field(1)and, in the future, opens the way to the development of novel antimalarials to this target enzyme.

In spite of research efforts to develop vaccines against the causative agent of human malaria, Plasmodium falciparum, effective control remains elusive. The predominant vaccine strategy focuses on targeting parasite blood stages in the vertebrate host. An alternative approach has been the development of transmission-blocking vaccines (TBVs). TBVs target antigens on parasite sexual stages that persist within the insect vector, anopheline mosquitoes, or target mosquito midgut proteins that are presumed to mediate parasite development. By blocking parasite development within the insect vector, TBVs effectively disrupt transmission and the resultant cascade of secondary infections. Using a mosquito midgut-specific mouse monoclonal antibody (MG96), we have partially characterized membrane-bound midgut glycoproteins in Anopheles gambiae and Anopheles stephensi. These proteins are present on the microvilli of midgut epithelial cells in both blood-fed and unfed mosquitoes, suggesting that the expression of the protein is not induced as a result of blood feeding. MG96 exhibits a dose-dependent blocking effect against Plasmodium yoelii development in An. stephensi. We achieved 100% blocking of parasite development in the mosquito midgut. Preliminary deglycosylation assays indicate that the epitope recognized by MG96 is a complex oligosaccharide. Future investigation of the carbohydrate epitope as well as gene identification should provide valuable insight into the possible mechanisms of ookinete attachment and invasion of mosquito midgut epithelial cells.

Life cell imaging is a tool for cell biology that has provided invaluable insights into many dynamic processes such as cell division, morphogenesis, or endo- and exocytosis. While observing cells by time-lapse imaging is a standard procedure in many systems, this technique was until recently not available for blood stages of Plasmodium falciparum, the causative agent of the most severe form of human malaria. Here, we provide a detailed description of the procedure for time-lapse-based four-dimensional microscopy in blood stages of this important pathogen. With the widespread use of P. falciparum transfection to fluorescently tag proteins of interest, this technique provides a new tool to study the biology of malaria blood stages that is hoped to lead to a better appreciation of the dynamic processes in this life cycle phase.

Plasmodium parasites, the causative agent of malaria, are transmitted through the bites of infected Anopheles mosquitoes resulting in over 250 million new infections each year. Despite decades of research, there is still no vaccine against malaria, highlighting the need for novel control strategies. One innovative approach is the use of genetically modified mosquitoes to effectively control malaria parasite transmission. Deliberate alterations of cell signaling pathways in the mosquito, via targeted mutagenesis, have been found to regulate parasite development (1). From these studies, we can begin to identify potential gene targets for transformation. Targeted mutagenesis has traditionally relied upon the homologous recombination between a target gene and a large DNA molecule. However, the construction and use of such complex DNA molecules for generation of stably transformed cell lines is costly, time consuming and often inefficient. Therefore, a strategy using locked nucleic acid-modified oligonucleotides (LNA-ONs) provides a useful alternative for introducing artificial single nucleotide substitutions into episomal and chromosomal DNA gene targets (reviewed in (2)). LNA-ON-mediated targeted mutagenesis has been used to introduce point mutations into genes of interest in cultured cells of both yeast and mice (3,4). We show here that LNA-ONs can be used to introduce a single nucleotide change in a transfected episomal target that results in a switch from blue fluorescent protein (BFP) expression to green fluorescent protein (GFP) expression in both Anopheles gambiae and Anopheles stephensi cells. This conversion demonstrates for the first time that effective mutagenesis of target genes in mosquito cells can be mediated by LNA-ONs and suggests that this technique may be applicable to mutagenesis of chromosomal targets in vitro and in vivo.

Cell-mediated immunity plays a crucial role in the control of many infectious diseases, necessitating the need for adjuvants that can augment cellular immune responses elicited by vaccines. It is well established that protection against one such disease, malaria, requires strong CD8(+) T cell responses targeted against the liver stages of the causative agent, Plasmodium spp. In this report we show that the dendritic cell-specific chemokine, dendritic cell-derived CC chemokine 1 (DC-CK1), which is produced in humans and acts on naive lymphocytes, can enhance Ag-specific CD8(+) T cell responses when coadministered with either irradiated Plasmodium yoelii sporozoites or a recombinant adenovirus expressing the P. yoelii circumsporozoite protein in mice. We further show that these enhanced T cell responses result in increased protection to malaria in immunized mice challenged with live P. yoelii sporozoites, revealing an adjuvant activity for DC-CK1. DC-CK1 appears to act preferentially on naive mouse lymphocytes, and its adjuvant effect requires IL-12, but not IFN-gamma or CD40. Overall, our results show for the first time an in vivo role for DC-CK1 in the establishment of primary T cell responses and indicate the potential of this chemokine as an adjuvant for vaccines against malaria as well as other diseases in which cellular immune responses are important.

It has been shown on the model pair Ae. aegypti-P. gallinaceum that dimilin, an inhibitor of insect chitin synthesis has practically no effect on female sensitivity to malaria agent. An analogue of the juvenile hormone juvemon at a concentration of 0.001-0.002 mg/l, causing death of 35% of insects, produces a 7-17% decrease in sporozoite index value. In concentration of 0.004-0.05 mg/l, there is a tendency towards an increase in the vector capacity of the survived female individuals. No differences in the intensity of infection have been revealed between test and control female individuals. No noticeable inhibition of the physiological conditions of test female individuals determined by the following parameters: activity of their aggression towards the donor and their death before and alter the infective feeding have been observed. Thus, none of the substances tested is an inhibitor of the development of malaria plasmodia and their vectors.

Malaria is characterized by cyclical fevers and high levels of inflammation, and while an early inflammatory response contributes to parasite clearance, excessive and persistent inflammation can lead to severe forms of the disease. Here, we show that Plasmodium falciparum-infected erythrocytes contain uric acid precipitates in the cytoplasm of the parasitophorous vacuole, which are released when erythrocytes rupture. Uric acid precipitates are highly inflammatory molecules that are considered a danger signal for innate immunity and are the causative agent in gout. We determined that P. falciparum-derived uric acid precipitates induce maturation of human dendritic cells, increasing the expression of cell surface co-stimulatory molecules such as CD80 and CD86, while decreasing human leukocyte antigen-DR expression. In accordance with this, uric acid accounts for a significant proportion of the total stimulatory activity induced by parasite-infected erythrocytes. Moreover, the identification of uric acid precipitates in P. falciparum- and P. vivax-infected erythrocytes obtained directly from malaria patients underscores the in vivo and clinical relevance of our findings. Altogether, our data implicate uric acid precipitates as a potentially important contributor to the innate immune response to Plasmodium infection and may provide a novel target for adjunct therapies.

Plasmodium falciparum is the main causative agent of malaria. Of the 5 484 predicted genes of P. falciparum, about 57% do not have sufficient sequence similarity to characterized genes in other species to warrant functional assignments. Non-homology methods are thus needed to obtain functional clues for these uncharacterized genes. Gene expression data have been widely used in the recent years to help functional annotation in an intra-species way via the so-called Guilt By Association (GBA) principle. We propose a new method that uses gene expression data to assess inter-species annotation transfers. Our approach starts from a set of likely orthologs between a reference species (here S. cerevisiae and D. melanogaster) and a query species (P. falciparum). It aims at identifying clusters of coexpressed genes in the query species whose coexpression has been conserved in the reference species. These conserved clusters of coexpressed genes are then used to assess annotation transfers between genes with low sequence similarity, enabling reliable transfers of annotations from the reference to the query species. The approach was used with transcriptomic data sets of P. falciparum, S. cerevisiae and D. melanogaster, and enabled us to propose with high confidence new/refined annotations for several dozens hypothetical/putative P. falciparum genes. Notably, we revised the annotation of genes involved in ribosomal proteins and ribosome biogenesis and assembly, thus highlighting several potential drug targets. Our approach uses both sequence similarity and gene expression data to help inter-species gene annotation transfers. Experiments show that this strategy improves the accuracy achieved when using solely sequence similarity and outperforms the accuracy of the GBA approach. In addition, our experiments with P. falciparum show that it can infer a function for numerous hypothetical genes.

Plasmodium falciparum, the causative agent of malaria, is sensitive to oxidative stress and therefore the family of antioxidant enzymes, peroxiredoxins (Prxs) represent a target for antimalarial drug design. We present here the 1.8 A resolution crystal structure of P.falciparum antioxidant protein, PfAOP, a Prx that in terms of sequence groups with mammalian PrxV. The structure is compared to all 11 known Prx structures to gain maximal insight into its properties. We describe the common Prx fold and show that the dimeric PfAOP can be mechanistically categorized as a 1-Cys Prx. In the active site the peroxidatic Cys is over-oxidized to cysteine sulfonic acid, making this the first Prx structure seen in that state. Now with structures of Prxs in Cys-sulfenic, -sulfinic and -sulfonic acid oxidation states known, the structural steps involved in peroxide binding and over-oxidation are suggested. We also describe that PfAOP has an alpha-aneurism (a one residue insertion), a feature that appears characteristic of the PrxV-like group. In terms of crystallographic methodology, we enhance the information content of the model by identifying bound water sites based on peak electron densities, and we use that information to infer that the oxidized active site has suboptimal interactions that may influence catalysis. The dimerization interface of PfAOP is representative of an interface that is widespread among Prxs, and has sequence-dependent variation in geometry. The interface differences and the structural features (like the alpha-aneurism) may be used as markers to better classify Prxs and study their evolution.

The culminating step of the intraerythrocytic development of Plasmodium falciparum, the causative agent of malaria, is the spectacular release of multiple invasive merozoites on rupture of the infected erythrocyte membrane. This work reports for the first time that the whole process, taking place in time scales as short as 400 milliseconds, is the result of an elastic instability of the infected erythrocyte membrane. Using high-speed differential interference contrast (DIC) video microscopy and epifluorescence, we demonstrate that the release occurs in 3 main steps after osmotic swelling of the infected erythrocyte: a pore opens in ~ 100 milliseconds, ejecting 1-2 merozoites, an outward curling of the erythrocyte membrane is then observed, ending with a fast eversion of the infected erythrocyte membrane, pushing the parasites forward. It is noteworthy that this last step shows slight differences when infected erythrocytes are adhering. We rationalize our observations by considering that during the parasite development, the infected erythrocyte membrane acquires a spontaneous curvature and we present a subsequent model describing the dynamics of the curling rim. Our results show that sequential erythrocyte membrane curling and eversion is necessary for the parasite efficient angular dispersion and might be biologically essential for fast and numerous invasions of new erythrocytes.

The structures of glycosylphosphatidylinositols (GPIs) in Plasmodium have been described [Gerold, Schuppert and Schwarz (1994) J. Biol. Chem. 269, 2597-2606]. A detailed understanding of GPI synthesis in Plasmodium is a prerequisite for identifying differences present in biosynthetic pathways of parasites and host cells. A comparison of the biosynthetic pathway of GPIs has revealed differences between mammalian cells and parasitic protozoans. A cell-free incubation system prepared from asexual erythrocytic stages of Plasmodium falciparum, the causative agent of malaria in humans, is capable of synthesizing the same spectrum of GPIs as that found in metabolically labelled parasites. The formation of mannosylated GPIs in the cell-free system is shown to be inhibited by GTP and, unexpectedly, micromolar concentrations of GDP-Man. Lower concentrations of GDP-Man affect the spectrum of GPIs synthesized. The inositol ring of GPIs of P. falciparum is modified by an acyl group. The preferred donor of this fatty acid at the inositol ring is myristoyl-CoA. Inositol acylation has to precede the mannosylation of GPIs because, in the absence of acyl-CoA or CoA, mannosylated GPIs were not detected. Inositol myristoylation is a unique feature of plasmodial GPIs and thus might provide a potential target for drug therapy.

Sphingolipids are essential components of eukaryotic cell membranes, particularly the plasma membrane, and are involved in a diverse array of signal transduction pathways. Mammals produce sphingomyelin (SM) as the primary complex sphingolipid via the well characterised SM synthase. In contrast yeast, plants and some protozoa utilise an evolutionarily related inositol phosphorylceramide (IPC) synthase to synthesise IPC. This activity has no mammalian equivalent and IPC synthase has been proposed as a target for anti-fungals and anti-protozoals. However, detailed knowledge of the sphingolipid biosynthetic pathway of the apicomplexan protozoan parasites was lacking. In this study bioinformatic analyses indicated a single copy orthologue of the putative SM synthase from the apicomplexan Plasmodium falciparum (the causative agent of malaria) was a bona fide sphingolipid synthase in the related model parasite, Toxoplasma gondii (TgSLS). Subsequently, TgSLS was indicated, by complementation of a mutant cell line, to be a functional orthologue of the yeast IPC synthase (AUR1p), demonstrating resistance to the well characterised AUR1p inhibitor aureobasidin A. In vitro, recombinant TgSLS exhibited IPC synthase activity and, for the first time, the presence of IPC was demonstrated in T. gondii lipid extracts by mass spectrometry. Furthermore, host sphingolipid biosynthesis was indicated to influence, but be non-essential for, T. gondii proliferation, suggesting that whilst scavenging does take place de novo sphingolipid synthesis may be important for parasitism.

Plasmodium vivax is traditionally known to cause benign tertian malaria, although recent reports suggest that P. vivax can also cause severe life-threatening disease analogous to severe infection due to P. falciparum. There are limited published data on the clinical and epidemiological profiles of children suffering from 'severe malaria' in an urban setting of India. To assess the clinical and epidemiological profiles of children with severe malaria, a prospective study was carried out during June 2008-December 2008 in the Department of Pediatrics, Guru Teg Bahadur Hospital, a tertiary hospital located in East Delhi, India. Data on children aged < or = 12 years, diagnosed with severe malaria, were analyzed for their demographic, clinical and laboratory parameters. All patients were categorized and treated as per the guidelines of the World Health Organization. In total, 1,680 children were screened for malaria at the paediatric outpatient and casualty facilities of the hospital. Thirty-eight children tested positive for malaria on peripheral smear examination (2.26% slide positivity rate). Of these, 27 (71%) were admitted and categorized as severe malaria as per the definition of the WHO while another 11 (29%) received treatment on outpatient basis. Most (24/27; 88.8%) cases of severe malaria (n=27) were infected with P. vivax. Among the cases of severe malaria caused by Plasmodium vivax (n=24), 12 (50%) presented with altered sensorium (cerebral malaria), seven (29.1%) had severe anaemia (haemoglobin <5 g/dL), and 17 (70.8%) had thrombocytopaenia, of which two had spontaneous bleeding (epistaxis). Cases of severe vivax malaria are clinically indistinguishable from severe falciparum malaria. Our study demonstrated that majority (88.8%) of severe malaria cases in children from Delhi and adjoining districts of Uttar Pradesh were due to P. vivax-associated infection. P. vivax should, thus, be regarded as an important causative agent for severe malaria in children.

Plasmodium falciparum, the causative agent of malaria, relies on a complex protein-secretion system for protein targeting into numerous subcellular destinations. Recently, a homologue of the Golgi re-assembly stacking protein (GRASP) was identified and used to characterise the Golgi organisation in this parasite. Here, we report on the presence of a splice variant that leads to the expression of a GRASP isoform. Although the first GRASP protein (GRASP1) relies on a well-conserved myristoylation motif, the variant (GRASP2) displays a different N-terminus, similar to GRASPs found in fungi. Phylogenetic analyses between GRASP proteins of numerous taxa point to an independent evolution of the unusual N-terminus that could reflect unique requirements for Golgi-dependent protein sorting and organelle biogenesis in P. falciparum. Golgi association of GRASP2 depends on the hydrophobic N-terminus that resembles a signal anchor, leading to a unique mode of Golgi targeting and membrane attachment.

It has recently been suggested that topoisomerases could be important targets for drugs used in several diseases. This prompted us to purify and characterize the topoisomerases I and II present in the erythrocytes of protozoan parasites of the genus Plasmodium, the causative agent of malaria, in order to later use these enzymatic systems in antimalarial drug assays. The topoisomerases were purified from Plasmodium berghei, a parasite of mouse red cells. The Plasmodium topoisomerase II consists of two subunits with a molecular weight of about 160K. The enzyme is ATP- and Mg2+-dependent. The conditions for the reactions of relaxation, unknotting, decatenation, and catenation were found to be similar to those observed with enzymes from other eukaryotic cells. The Plasmodium topoisomerase I is a monomeric enzyme with a Mr of 70K-100K. It is ATP-independent and K+- or Na-dependent. Mg2+ is not required for relaxation but stimulates the reaction. Topoisomerase II was more sensitive to drug action than topoisomerase I. The most active drugs were the ellipticine derivatives. The antimalarial drugs, currently used in human clinical therapy, were poor inhibitors. Some antitumoral drugs stimulated the double-stranded DNA cleavage activity of Plasmodium topoisomerase II, like that of mammalian topoisomerases II. Antimalarial drugs had no stimulating activity. It is therefore suggested that Plasmodium topoisomerases are not good targets for antimalarial drugs.

In this study, the epidemiological characteristics of malaria cases in Edirne province were investigated. Between the years of 1994-2002, a total of 317,087 blood samples were collected from soldiers in the province with selective active surveillance and from the resident population with active or passive surveillance methods, by the medical staff of Malaria Control Department and Health Centers, to search the presence of Plasmodium. In 281 of them Plasmodium spp. were detected, and the characteristics of malaria cases were investigated. Of the cases, 238 (84.7%) were detected in the first three years and mostly in September. While the indigenous cases were detected in the districts where rice planted intensely, the imported cases were detected in the districts heavily populated by military staff. Of the imported cases, 62% originated from Diyarbakir, Batman and Sanliurfa provinces (Southeast part of Turkey). P. vivax was detected as the causative agent in all blood samples except one P. ovale. This latter case has been the only one in Turkey so far and he was a student from Afghanistan. Attaching importance to fight off mosquitoes in intensely rice planted districts and strictly surveying the military staff, particularly from the region of Southern-East Anatolia, have led to successful control of the malaria cases in Edirne region.

Plasmodium falciparum is the causative agent of the most burdensome form of human malaria, affecting 200-300 million individuals per year worldwide. The recently sequenced genome of P. falciparum revealed over 5,400 genes, of which 60% encode proteins of unknown function. Insights into the biochemical function and regulation of these genes will provide the foundation for future drug and vaccine development efforts toward eradication of this disease. By analyzing the complete asexual intraerythrocytic developmental cycle (IDC) transcriptome of the HB3 strain of P. falciparum, we demonstrate that at least 60% of the genome is transcriptionally active during this stage. Our data demonstrate that this parasite has evolved an extremely specialized mode of transcriptional regulation that produces a continuous cascade of gene expression, beginning with genes corresponding to general cellular processes, such as protein synthesis, and ending with Plasmodium-specific functionalities, such as genes involved in erythrocyte invasion. The data reveal that genes contiguous along the chromosomes are rarely coregulated, while transcription from the plastid genome is highly coregulated and likely polycistronic. Comparative genomic hybridization between HB3 and the reference genome strain (3D7) was used to distinguish between genes not expressed during the IDC and genes not detected because of possible sequence variations. Genomic differences between these strains were found almost exclusively in the highly antigenic subtelomeric regions of chromosomes. The simple cascade of gene regulation that directs the asexual development of P. falciparum is unprecedented in eukaryotic biology. The transcriptome of the IDC resembles a "just-in-time" manufacturing process whereby induction of any given gene occurs once per cycle and only at a time when it is required. These data provide to our knowledge the first comprehensive view of the timing of transcription throughout the intraerythrocytic development of P. falciparum and provide a resource for the identification of new chemotherapeutic and vaccine candidates.

A novel method for the in vitro detection of the protozoan Plasmodium, the causative agent of malaria, has been developed. It comprises a protocol for cleanup of whole blood samples, followed by direct ultraviolet laser desorption (LD) time-of-flight mass spectrometry. Intense ion signals are observed from intact ferriprotoporphyrin IX (heme), sequestered by malaria parasites during their growth in human red blood cells. The LD mass spectrum of the heme is structure-specific, and the signal intensities are correlated with the sample parasitemia (number of parasites per unit volume of blood). Parasitemia levels on the order of 10 parasites/microL blood can be unambiguously detected by this method. Consideration of laser beam parameters (spot size, rastering across the sample surface) and actual sample consumption suggests that the detection limits can be further improved by at least an order of magnitude. The influence of experimental factors, such as desorbed ion polarity, laser exposure and fluence, sample size, and parasite growth stage, on the threshold for parasite detection is also addressed.

Malaria parasites are known to invade and develop in erythrocytes and reticulocytes, but little is known about their infection of nucleated erythroid precursors. We used an in vitro cell system that progressed through basophilic, polychromatic, orthochromatic, and reticulocyte stages to mature erythrocytes. We show that orthochromatic cells are the earliest stages that may be invaded by Plasmodium falciparum, the causative agent of fatal human malaria. Susceptibility to invasion is distinct from intracellular survival and occurs at a time of extensive erythroid remodeling. Together these data suggest that the potential for complexity of host interactions involved in infection may be vastly greater than hitherto realized.

A causative agent of human malaria, Plasmodium falciparum, is transmitted by Anopheles mosquitoes. The malaria parasite is under intensive attack from the mosquito's innate immune system during its sporogonic development. We have used genetic engineering to create immune-enhanced Anopheles stephensi mosquitoes through blood meal-inducible expression of a transgene encoding the IMD pathway-controlled NF-kB Rel2 transcription factor in the midgut and fat-body tissue. Transgenic mosquitoes showed greater resistance to Plasmodium and microbial infection as a result of timely concerted tissue-specific immune attacks involving multiple effectors. The relatively weak impact of this genetic modification on mosquito fitness under laboratory conditions encourages further investigation of this approach for malaria control.

Decoquinate has single-digit nanomolar activity against in vitro blood stage Plasmodium falciparum parasites, the causative agent of human malaria. In vitro evolution of decoquinate-resistant parasites and subsequent comparative genomic analysis to the drug-sensitive parental strain revealed resistance was conferred by two nonsynonymous single nucleotide polymorphisms in the gene encoding cytochrome b. The resultant amino acid mutations, A122T and Y126C, reside within helix C in the ubiquinol-binding pocket of cytochrome b, an essential subunit of the cytochrome bc(1) complex. As with other cytochrome bc(1) inhibitors, such as atovaquone, decoquinate has low nanomolar activity against in vitro liver stage P. yoelii and provides partial prophylaxis protection when administered to infected mice at 50 mg kg(-1). In addition, transgenic parasites expressing yeast dihydroorotate dehydrogenase are >200-fold less sensitive to decoquinate, which provides additional evidence that this drug inhibits the parasite's mitochondrial electron transport chain. Importantly, decoquinate exhibits limited cross-resistance to a panel of atovaquone-resistant parasites evolved to harbor various mutations in cytochrome b. The basis for this difference was revealed by molecular docking studies, in which both of these inhibitors were shown to have distinctly different modes of binding within the ubiquinol-binding site of cytochrome b.

IFN-gamma secretion by natural killer (NK) cells is pivotal to several tumor and viral immune responses, during which NK and dendritic cells cooperation is required. We show here that macrophages are mandatory for NK cell IFN-gamma secretion in response to erythrocytes infected with Plasmodium falciparum (Pf), a causative agent of human malaria. In addition, direct sensing of Pf infection by NK cells induces their production of the proinflammatory chemokine CXCL8, without triggering their granule-mediated cytolytic programs. Despite their reported role in Pf recognition, Toll-like receptor (TLR) 2, TLR9, and TLR11 are individually dispensable for NK cell activation induced by Pf-infected erythrocytes. However, IL-18R expression on NK cells, IL-18 production by macrophages, and MyD88 on both cell types are essential components of this previously undescribed pathway of NK cell activation in response to a parasite infection.

An essential requisite for transmission of Plasmodium, the causative agent of malaria, is the successful completion of a complex developmental cycle in its mosquito vector. Of hundreds of ookinetes that form in the mosquito midgut, only few transform into oocysts, a loss attributed to the action of the mosquito immune system. However, once oocysts form, they appear to be resistant to mosquito defences. During oocyst development, a thick capsule forms around the parasite and appears to function as a protective cover. Little information is available about the composition of this capsule. Here we report on the identification and partial characterization of the first Plasmodium oocyst capsule protein (PbCap380). Genetic analysis indicates that the gene is essential and that PbCap380(-) mutant parasites form oocysts in normal numbers but are gradually eliminated. As a result, mosquitoes infected with PbCap380(-) parasites do not transmit malaria. Targeting of the oocyst capsule may provide a new strategy for malaria control.

Plasmodium falciparum, the causative agent of the most deadly form of human malaria, is unable to salvage pyrimidines and must rely on de novo biosynthesis for survival. Dihydroorotate dehydrogenase (DHODH) catalyzes the rate-limiting step in the pyrimidine biosynthetic pathway and represents a potential target for anti-malarial therapy. A high throughput screen and subsequent medicinal chemistry program identified a series of N-alkyl-5-(1H-benzimidazol-1-yl)thiophene-2-carboxamides with low nanomolar in vitro potency against DHODH from P. falciparum, P. vivax, and P. berghei. The compounds were selective for the parasite enzymes over human DHODH, and x-ray structural data on the analog Genz-667348, demonstrated that species selectivity could be attributed to amino acid differences in the inhibitor-binding site. Compounds from this series demonstrated in vitro potency against the 3D7 and Dd2 strains of P. falciparum, good tolerability and oral exposure in the mouse, and ED(50) values in the 4-day murine P. berghei efficacy model of 13-21 mg/kg/day with oral twice-daily dosing. In particular, treatment with Genz-667348 at 100 mg/kg/day resulted in sterile cure. Two recent analogs of Genz-667348 are currently undergoing pilot toxicity testing to determine suitability as clinical development candidates.

In the Republic of Yemen, Plasmodium falciparum is the predominant causative agent of malaria and is associated with adverse consequences for pregnant women and their babies. The prevalence and clinical manifestations of malaria among 500 pregnant (260) and non-pregnant (240) women were compared. Clinical examinations, laboratory investigations and a structured questionnaire were used to collect data. The prevalence of malaria was higher among pregnant women (55%) than non-pregnant women (20%). Anaemia was significantly more prevalent among pregnant woman than non-pregnant women and also more prevalent in pregnant women with malaria than non-pregnant women with malaria.

Plasmodium sporozoites, the causative agent of malaria, are injected into their vertebrate host through the bite of an infected Anopheles mosquito, homing to the liver where they invade hepatocytes to proliferate and develop into merozoites that, upon reaching the bloodstream, give rise to the clinical phase of infection. To investigate how host cell signal transduction pathways affect hepatocyte infection, we used RNAi to systematically test the entire kinome and associated genes in human Huh7 hepatoma cells for their potential roles during infection by P. berghei sporozoites. The three-phase screen covered 727 genes, which were tested with a total of 2,307 individual siRNAs using an automated microscopy assay to quantify infection rates and qRT-PCR to assess silencing levels. Five protein kinases thereby emerged as top hits, all of which caused significant reductions in infection when silenced by RNAi. Follow-up validation experiments on one of these hits, PKCsigma (PKCzeta), confirmed the physiological relevance of our findings by reproducing the inhibitory effect on P. berghei infection in adult mice treated systemically with liposome-formulated PKCsigma-targeting siRNAs. Additional cell-based analyses using a pseudo-substrate inhibitor of PKCsigma added further RNAi-independent support, indicating a role for host PKCsigma on the invasion of hepatocytes by sporozoites. This study represents the first comprehensive, functional genomics-driven identification of novel host factors involved in Plasmodium sporozoite infection.

Single-stranded DNA binding (SSB) proteins play central roles in genome maintenance in all organisms. Plasmodium falciparum, the causative agent of malaria, encodes an SSB protein that localizes to the apicoplast and likely functions in the replication and maintenance of its genome. P. falciparum SSB (Pf-SSB) shares a high degree of sequence homology with bacterial SSB proteins but differs in the composition of its C-terminus, which interacts with more than a dozen other proteins in Escherichia coli SSB (Ec-SSB). Using sedimentation methods, we show that Pf-SSB forms a stable homo-tetramer alone and when bound to single-stranded DNA (ssDNA). We also present a crystal structure at 2.1 Å resolution of the Pf-SSB tetramer bound to two (dT)(35) molecules. The Pf-SSB tetramer is structurally similar to the Ec-SSB tetramer, and ssDNA wraps completely around the tetramer with a "baseball seam" topology that is similar to Ec-SSB in its "65 binding mode". However, the polarity of the ssDNA wrapping around Pf-SSB is opposite to that observed for Ec-SSB. The interactions between the bases in the DNA and the amino acid side chains also differ from those observed in the Ec-SSB-DNA structure, suggesting that other differences may exist in the DNA binding properties of these structurally similar proteins.

Malaria is a devastating disease. For transmission to occur, Plasmodium, the causative agent of malaria, must complete a complex developmental cycle in its mosquito vector. Thus, the mosquito is a potential target for disease control. Plasmodium ookinetes, which develop within the mosquito midgut, must first cross the midgut's peritrophic matrix (PM), a thick extracellular sheath that completely surrounds the blood meal. The PM poses a partial, natural barrier against parasite invasion of the midgut and it is speculated that modifications to the PM may lead to a complete barrier to infection. However, such strategies require thorough characterization of the structure of the PM. Here, we describe for the first time, the complete PM proteome of the main malaria vector, Anopheles gambiae. Altogether, 209 proteins were identified by mass spectrometry. Among them were nine new chitin-binding peritrophic matrix proteins, expanding the list from three to twelve peritrophins. Lastly, we provide a model for the putative interactions among the proteins identified in this study.

The causative agent of malaria, Plasmodium, possesses three translationally active compartments: the cytosol, the mitochondrion and a relic plastid called the apicoplast. Aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases to charge tRNA are thus required for all three compartments. However, the Plasmodiumfalciparum genome encodes too few tRNA synthetases to supply a unique enzyme for each amino acid in all three compartments. We have investigated the subcellular localisation of three tRNA synthetases (AlaRS, GlyRS and ThrRS), which occur only once in the nuclear genome, and we show that each of these enzymes is dually localised to the P. falciparum cytosol and the apicoplast. No mitochondrial fraction is apparent for these three enzymes, which suggests that the Plasmodium mitochondrion lacks at least these three tRNA synthetases. The unique Plasmodium ThrRS is the presumed target of the antimalarial compound borrelidin. Borrelidin kills P. falciparum parasites quickly without the delayed death effect typical of apicoplast translation inhibitors and without an observable effect on apicoplast morphology. By contrast, mupirocin, an inhibitor of the apicoplast IleRS, kills with a delayed death effect that inhibits apicoplast growth and division. Because inhibition of dual targeted tRNA synthetases should arrest translation in all compartments of the parasite, these enzymes deserve further investigation as potential targets for antimalarial drug development.

The global area for Plasmodium ovale is small as compared with that for other species of human malaria pathogens. It has expanded in Asian areas and remained as before in the African ones. In the past 20 years, there have been 2129 malaria cases imported from far abroad to Russia, including 84 (4%) cases of vivax malaria (P. ovale). The patients were most foreign citizens: 70 from 20 African countries and 7 from two countries of Oceania, such as Papua New Guinea and Indonesia. The other 7 patients were Russia's people who had returned from different countries of Africa. For this period there have been a total of 5 cases of mixed infection: tropical P. falciparum malaria + vivax P. ovale malaria. The mission of detected new sympatric subspecies (P. ovale curtisi and P. ovale wallikeri) inhabiting the tropical countries with continuous local transmission remains unclear. Only a thorough study of these subspecies will be able to effectively apply preventive measures and to carry out their elimination in future.

Plasmodium falciparum is the causative agent of the most severe type of malaria, a life-threatening disease affecting the lives of over three billion people. Factors like widespread resistance against available drugs and absence of an effective vaccine are seriously compounding control of the malaria parasite. Thus, there is an urgent need for the identification and validation of new drug targets. The enzymes of the polyamine biosynthesis pathway have been suggested as possible targets for the treatment of malaria. One of these enzymes is spermidine synthase (SPDS, putrescine aminopropyltransferase), which catalyzes the transfer of an aminopropyl moiety from decarboxylated S-adenosylmethionine (dcAdoMet) to putrescine, leading to the formation of spermidine and 5'-methylthioadenosine. Here we present the three-dimensional structure of P. falciparum spermidine synthase (pfSPDS) in apo form, in complex with dcAdoMet and two inhibitors, S-adenosyl-1,8-diamino-3-thio-octane (AdoDATO) and trans-4-methylcyclohexylamine (4MCHA). The results show that binding of dcAdoMet to pfSPDS stabilizes the conformation of the flexible gatekeeper loop of the enzyme and affects the conformation of the active-site amino acid residues, preparing the protein for binding of the second substrate. The complexes of AdoDATO and 4MCHA with pfSPDS reveal the mode of interactions of these compounds with the enzyme. While AdoDATO essentially fills the entire active-site pocket, 4MCHA only occupies part of it, which suggests that simple modifications of this compound may yield more potent inhibitors of pfSPDS.

Antibacterial, antiparasitidal and antiviral properties have recently been attributed to members of the secreted phospholipases A(2) (sPLA(2)s) superfamily. Seven sPLA(2)s from groups IA, IB, IIA and III, were tested here in different culture conditions for inhibition of the in vitro intraerythrocytic development of Plasmodium falciparum, the causative agent of the most severe form of human malaria. In the presence of human serum, all sPLA(2)s were inhibitory, with three out of seven exhibiting IC(50)<0.1 nM. In all cases, inhibition could be induced by enzymatic pre-treatment of the serum. By contrast, no effect was observed when parasites were grown in a semi-defined medium (AlbuMAX II) devoid of lipoproteins and containing 10 times less phospholipids than the medium with human serum, strongly suggesting that hydrolysis of serum generating toxic lipid by-products, rather than a direct interaction of the sPLA(2) with the infected erythrocyte, is a general feature of the anti-Plasmodium properties of sPLA(2)s. Furthermore, in serum, six out of the seven sPLA(2)s were toxic against both trophozoite and schizont stages of the parasite development, contrasting with the trophozoite-selective bee venom enzyme's toxicity. Deciphering the molecular mechanisms at play in the phenotypic singularity of the bee venom enzyme toxicity might offer new prospects in antimalarial fight.

The effectiveness of methylene blue (MB) combined with pyrimethamine (PYR), chloroquine (CQ) or quinine (Q) was examined in a classical four-day suppressive test against a causative agent of rodent malaria, Plasmodium berghei. A marked potentiation was observed when MB was administered at a non-curative dose of 15 mg/kg/day in combination with PYR (0.19 mg/kg/day) or Q (25 mg/kg/day). No synergy was found between MB (15 mg/Kg) and CQ (0.75 mg/Kg). Our results suggest that the combination of MB with PYR or Q may improve the efficacy of these currently used antimalarial drugs.

Plasmodium falciparum, the causative agent of human malaria, invades host erythrocytes using several proteins on the surface of the invasive merozoite, which have been proposed as potential vaccine candidates. Members of the multi-gene PfRh family are surface antigens that have been shown to play a central role in directing merozoites to alternative erythrocyte receptors for invasion. Recently, we identified a large structural polymorphism, a 0.58Kb deletion, in the C-terminal region of the PfRh2b gene, present at a high frequency in parasite populations from Senegal. We hypothesize that this region is a target of humoral immunity. Here, by analyzing 371 P. falciparum isolates we show that this major allele is present at varying frequencies in different populations within Senegal, Africa, and throughout the world. For allelic dimorphisms in the asexual stage antigens, Msp-2 and EBA-175, we find minimal geographic differentiation among parasite populations from Senegal and other African localities, suggesting extensive gene flow among these populations and/or immune-mediated frequency-dependent balancing selection. In contrast, we observe a higher level of inter-population divergence (as measured by F(st)) for the PfRh2b deletion, similar to that observed for SNPs from the sexual stage Pfs45/48 loci, which is postulated to be under directional selection. We confirm that the region containing the PfRh2b polymorphism is a target of humoral immune responses by demonstrating antibody reactivity of endemic sera. Our analysis of inter-population divergence suggests that in contrast to the large allelic dimorphisms in EBA-175 and Msp-2, the presence or absence of the large PfRh2b deletion may not elicit frequency-dependent immune selection, but may be under positive immune selection, having important implications for the development of these proteins as vaccine candidates.

Plasmodium falciparum, the causative agent of the most severe form of malaria in humans invades erythrocytes using multiple ligand-receptor interactions. The P. falciparum reticulocyte binding-like homologue proteins (PfRh or PfRBL) are important for entry of the invasive merozoite form of the parasite into red blood cells. We have analysed two members of this protein family, PfRh2a and PfRh2b, and show they undergo a complex series of proteolytic cleavage events before and during merozoite invasion. We show that PfRh2a undergoes a cleavage event in the transmembrane region during invasion consistent with activity of the membrane associated PfROM4 protease that would result in release of the ectodomain into the supernatant. We also show that PfRh2a and PfRh2b bind to red blood cells and have defined the erythrocyte-binding domain to a 15 kDa region at the N-terminus of each protein. Antibodies to this receptor-binding region block merozoite invasion demonstrating the important function of this domain. This region of PfRh2a and PfRh2b has potential in a combination vaccine with other erythrocyte binding ligands for induction of antibodies that would block a broad range of invasion pathways for P. falciparum into human erythrocytes.

Human malaria is among the most ubiquitous and destructive tropical, parasitic diseases in the world today. The causative agent, Plasmodium falciparum, contains an unusual, essential organelle known as the apicoplast. Inhibition of this degenerate chloroplast results in second generation death of the parasite and is the mechanism by which antibiotics function in treating malaria. In order to better understand the biochemistry of this organelle, we have cloned a putative, 20 kDa, co-chaperonin protein, Pf-cpn20, which localizes to the apicoplast. Although this protein is homologous to the cpn20 that is found in plant chloroplasts, its ability to function as a co-chaperonin was questioned in the past. In the present study, we carried out a structural analysis of Pf-cpn20 using circular dichroism and analytical ultracentrifugation and then used two different approaches to investigate the ability of this protein to function as a co-chaperonin. In the first approach, we purified recombinant Pf-cpn20 and tested its ability to act as a co-chaperonin for GroEL in vitro, while in the second, we examined the ability of Pf-cpn20 to complement an E. coli depletion of the essential bacterial co-chaperonin GroES. Our results demonstrate that Pf-cpn20 is fully functional as a co-chaperonin in vitro. Moreover, the parasitic co-chaperonin is able to replace GroES in E. coli at both normal and heat-shock temperatures. Thus, Pf-cpn20 functions as a co-chaperonin in chaperonin-mediated protein folding. The ability of the malarial protein to function in E. coli suggests that this simple system can be used as a tool for further analyses of Pf-cpn20 and perhaps other chaperone proteins from P. falciparum.

The synthesis of the recently characterized depsipeptide szentiamide (1), which is produced by the entomopathogenic bacterium Xenorhabdus szentirmaii, is described. Whereas no biological activity was previously identified for 1, the material derived from the efficient synthesis enabled additional bioactivity tests leading to the identification of a notable activity against insect cells and Plasmodium falciparum, the causative agent of malaria.

It is generally accepted that the mitochondria play central roles in energy production of most eukaryotes. In contrast, it has been thought that Plasmodium spp., the causative agent of malaria, rely mainly on cytosolic glycolysis but not mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation for energy production during blood stages. However, Plasmodium spp. possesses all genes necessary for the tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle and most of the genes for electron transport chain (ETC) enzymes. Therefore, it remains elusive whether oxidative phosphorylation is essential for the parasite survival. To elucidate the role of TCA metabolism and ETC in malaria parasites, we deleted the gene for flavoprotein (Fp) subunit, Pbsdha, one of four components of complex II, a catalytic subunit for succinate dehydrogenase activity. The Pbsdha(-) parasite grew normally at blood stages in mouse. In contrast, ookinete formation of Pbsdha(-) parasites in the mosquito stage was severely impaired. Finally, Pbsdha(-) ookinetes failed in oocyst formation, leading to complete malaria transmission blockade. These results suggest that malaria parasite may switch the energy metabolism from glycolysis to oxidative phosphorylation to adapt to the insect vector where glucose is not readily available for ATP production.

Plasmodium falciparum, the causative agent of the deadliest form of malaria, and human immunodeficiency virus type-1 (HIV-1) are among the most important health problems worldwide, being responsible for a total of 4 million deaths annually. Due to their extensive overlap in developing regions, especially Sub-Saharan Africa, co-infections with malaria and HIV-1 are common, but the interplay between the two diseases is poorly understood. Epidemiological reports have suggested that malarial infection transiently enhances HIV-1 replication and increases HIV-1 viral load in co-infected individuals. Because this viremia stays high for several weeks after treatment with antimalarials, this phenomenon could have an impact on disease progression and transmission. The cellular immunological mechanisms behind these observations have been studied only scarcely. The few in vitro studies investigating the impact of malaria on HIV-1 have demonstrated that exposure to soluble malarial antigens can increase HIV-1 infection and reactivation in immune cells. However, these studies used whole cell extracts of P. falciparum schizont stage parasites and peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC), making it hard to decipher which malarial component(s) was responsible for the observed effects and what the target host cells were. Recent work has demonstrated that exposure of immature monocyte-derived dendritic cells to the malarial pigment hemozoin increased their ability to transfer HIV-1 to CD4+ T cells, but that it decreased HIV-1 infection of macrophages(8). To shed light on this complex process, a systematic analysis of the interactions between the malaria parasite and HIV-1 in different relevant human primary cell populations is critically needed. Several techniques for investigating the impact of HIV-1 on the phagocytosis of micro-organisms and the effect of such pathogens on HIV-1 replication have been described. We here present a method to investigate the effects of P. falciparum-infected erythrocytes on the replication of HIV-1 in human primary monocyte-derived macrophages. The impact of parasite exposure on HIV-1 transcriptional/translational events is monitored by using single cycle pseudotyped viruses in which a luciferase reporter gene has replaced the Env gene while the effect on the quantity of virus released by the infected macrophages is determined by measuring the HIV-1 capsid protein p24 by ELISA in cell supernatants.

Plasmodium falciparum, the major causative agent of human malaria, contains three separate genomes. The apicoplast (an intracellular organelle) contains an ∼35-kb circular DNA genome of unusually high A/T content (>86%) that is replicated by the nuclear-encoded replication complex Pfprex. Herein, we have expressed and purified the DNA polymerase domain of Pfprex [KPom1 (Klenow-like polymerase of malaria 1)] and measured its fidelity using a LacZ-based forward mutation assay. In addition, we analyzed the kinetic parameters for the incorporation of both complementary and noncomplementary nucleotides using Kpom1 lacking 3'→5' exonucleolytic activity. KPom1 exhibits a strongly biased mutational spectrum in which T→C is the most frequent single-base substitution and differs significantly from the closely related Escherichia coli DNA polymerase I. Using E. coli harboring a temperature-sensitive polymerase I allele, we established that KPom1 can complement the growth-defective phenotype at an elevated temperature. We propose that the error bias of KPom1 may be exploited in the complementation assay to identify nucleoside analogs that mimic this base-mispairing and preferentially inhibit apicoplast DNA replication.

The merozoite surface protein (MSP)-1 of Plasmodium falciparum, the causative agent of malaria tropica, is considered to be a promising vaccine candidate. Although its stable cloning and expression has been difficult in the past, adenoviral vectors expressing the complex protein are described in the present study. Codon-optimized msp-1 was used to construct a set of first generation (ΔE1Ad) and high-capacity adenovirus (HC-Ad) vectors, and cellular and humoral immune responses induced by the vectors were characterized in detail in mice. Generation of stable ΔE1Ad and HC-Ad vectors expressing full-length MSP-1 and their production to high vector titers was found to be feasible. Epitope identification and analysis of frequencies of specific CD8 T-cells revealed that MSP-1 expressing HC-Ad vectors induced higher frequencies of interferon-γ + CD8 T-cells than ΔE1 vectors. Irrespective of the vector format, higher titers of MSP-1 specific antibodies were generated by Ad vectors expressing MSP-1 from a chicken β-actin (CAG) promoter comprising the cytomegalovirus early enhancer element and the chicken β-actin promoter. The findings of the present study suggest that Ad vectors expressing full-length codon-optimized MSP-1 are promising candidate vaccines against P. falciparum infections. Use of the HC-Ad vector type for delivery, as well as the CAG promoter to control MSP-1 expression, may further increase the efficacy of this vaccine candidate.

Dendritic cells (DC) and macrophages phagocytose pathogens and degrade them in their phagosomes to allow for proper presentation of foreign antigens to other cells of the immune system. The Plasmodium parasite, causative agent of malaria, infects RBC that are phagocytosed by DC and macrophages during the course of infection. Under specific conditions, the functionality of these cells can be affected by phagocytosis of Plasmodium-infected RBC. We investigated whether phagosomal maturation and degradation of Plasmodium yoelii-infected RBC in phagosomes is affected in DC and macrophages. We show that recruitment of the phagolysosomal marker Lamp-1 and of MHC-II, as well as acidification of phagosomes, was achieved in a timely manner. Using P. yoelii-infected RBC labelled with a fluorescent dye or transgenic green fluorescent protein (GFP)-expressing parasites, we found a gradual, rapid decrease in the phagosome fluorescence signal, indicating that P. yoelii-infected RBC are efficiently degraded in macrophages and DC. We also observed that pre-incubation of DC with infected RBC did not affect phagosomal maturation of newly internalized P. yoelii-infected RBC. In conclusion, after phagocytosis, Plasmodium-infected RBC are degraded by DC and macrophages, suggesting that the process of phagosomal maturation is effectively completed in malaria.

Plasmodium, the causative agent of malaria, has to undergo sexual differentiation and development in anopheline mosquitoes for transmission to occur. To isolate genes specifically induced in both organisms during the early stages of Plasmodium differentiation in the mosquito, two cDNA libraries were constructed, one enriched for sequences expressed in differentiating Plasmodium berghei ookinetes and another enriched for sequences expressed in Anopheles stephensi guts containing invading ookinetes and early oocysts. Sequencing of 457 ookinete library clones and 652 early oocyst clones represented 175 and 346 unique expressed sequence tags, respectively. Nine of 13 Plasmodium and four of the five Anopheles novel expressed sequence tags analyzed on Northern blots were induced during ookinete differentiation and mosquito gut invasion. Ancaspase-7, an Anopheles effector caspase, is proteolytically activated during Plasmodium invasion of the midgut. WARP, a gene encoding a Plasmodium surface protein with a von Willebrand factor A-like adhesive domain, is expressed only in ookinetes and early oocysts. An anti-WARP polyclonal antibody strongly inhibits (70-92%) Plasmodium development in the mosquito, making it a candidate antigen for transmission blocking vaccines. The present results and those of an accompanying report (Srinivasan, P., Abraham, E. G., Ghosh, A. K., Valenzuela, J., Ribeiro, J. M. C., Dimopoulos G., Kafatos, F. C., Adams, J.

The naturally occurring benzoquinone ansamycin compound, geldanamycin (GA), is a specific inhibitor of heat shock protein 90 (Hsp90) and is a potential anticancer agent. Since Plasmodium falciparum has been reported to have an Hsp90 ortholog, we tested the possibility that GA might inhibit it and thereby display antiparasitic activity. We provide direct recombinant DNA evidence for the Hsp90 protein of Plasmodium falciparum, the causative agent of fatal malaria. While the mRNA of Hsp90 was mainly expressed in ring and trophozoite stages, the protein was found in all stages, although schizonts contained relatively lower amounts. In vitro the parasitic Hsp90 exhibited an ATP-binding activity that could be specifically inhibited by GA. Plasmodium growth in human erythrocyte culture was strongly inhibited by GA with an IC50 of 20 nM, compared to the IC50 of 15 nM for chloroquine (CQ) under identical conditions. When used in combination, the two drugs acted synergistically. GA was equally effective against CQ-sensitive and CQ-resistant strains (3D7 and W2, respectively) and on all erythrocytic stages of the parasite. Together, these results suggest that an active and essential Hsp90 chaperone cycle exists in Plasmodium and that the ansamycin antibiotics will be an important tool to dissect its role in the parasite. Additionally, the favorable pharmacology of GA, reported in human trials, makes it a promising antimalarial drug.

Plasmodium falciparum is the main causative agent of tropical malaria, the most severe parasitic disease in the world. Growing resistance of Plasmodia towards available drugs is an increasing problem in countries where malaria is endemic. As Plasmodia are sensitive to oxidative stress, augmenting this in the parasite represents a promising principle for the development of novel antimalarial drugs. The NADP-dependent glutamate dehydrogenase (GDH) of P.falciparum is largely responsible for the production of NADPH in the parasite, which in turn serves as electron source for the antioxidative enzymes glutathione reductase and thioredoxin reductase. As GDH does not occur in the host erythrocyte, GDH is a particularly attractive target for drug therapy. The three-dimensional structure of P.falciparum GDH in the unligated state has been determined by X-ray crystallography to a resolution of 2.7A. Compared to the mammalian enzymes, two amino acid residues are exchanged in the putative active site of the parasite GDH. The most obvious differences between parasite and human GDH are the subunit interfaces of the hexameric proteins. In the parasite protein, several salt-bridges mediate contacts between the subunits whereas in the human enzyme these interactions are mainly of hydrophobic nature. Furthermore, P.falciparum GDH possesses a unique N-terminal extension that does not occur in any other GDH sequence so far studied. These findings might be exploited for the design of peptidomimetics capable of disrupting the oligomeric organisation of the parasite enzyme.

Mitochondrial (mt) genomes from diverse phylogenetic groups vary considerably in size, structure, and organization. The genus Plasmodium, causative agent of malaria, of the phylum Apicomplexa, has the smallest mt genome in the form of a circular and/or tandemly repeated linear element of 6 kb, encoding only three protein genes (cox1, cox3, and cob). The closely related genera Babesia and Theileria also have small mt genomes (6.6 kb) that are monomeric linear with an organization distinct from Plasmodium. To elucidate the structural divergence and evolution of mt genomes between Babesia/Theileria and Plasmodium, we determined five new sequences from Babesia bigemina, B. caballi, B. gibsoni, Theileria orientalis, and T. equi. Together with previously reported sequences of B. bovis, T. annulata, and T. parva, all eight Babesia and Theileria mt genomes are linear molecules with terminal inverted repeats (TIRs) on both ends containing three protein-coding genes (cox1, cox3, and cob) and six large subunit (LSU) ribosomal RNA (rRNA) gene fragments. The organization and transcriptional direction of protein-coding genes and the rRNA gene fragments were completely conserved in the four Babesia species. In contrast, notable variation occurred in the four Theileria species. Although the genome structures of T. annulata and T. parva were nearly identical to those of Babesia, an inversion in the 3-kb central region was found in T. orientalis. Moreover, the T. equi mt genome is the largest (8.2 kb) and most divergent with unusually long TIR sequences, in which cox3 and two LSU rRNA gene fragments are located. The T. equi mt genome showed little synteny to the other species. These results suggest that the Theileria mt genome is highly diverse with lineage-specific evolution in two Theileria species: genome inversion in T. orientalis and gene-embedded long TIR in T. equi.

A new lycorine derivative LT1 (4) was isolated from the aerial part and bulbs of Lycoris traubii Hayward (Amaryllidaceae). Its structure including absolute configuration was established by spectroscopic analysis and semi-synthesis to be 1-O-(3'S)-hydroxybutanoyllycorine. Some lycorine ester derivatives including LT1 were examined for their inhibitory activity against Trypanosoma brucei brucei, the parasite associated with sleeping sickness, and against Plasmodium falciparum, the causative agent of malaria. Among them, 2-O-acetyllycorine (6) showed the most potent activity against parasitic T. b. brucei, and LT1 (4), 1-O-(3'R)-hydroxybutanoyllycorine (8), 1,2-di-O-butanoyllycorine (11), and 1-O-propanoyllycorine (12) showed significant activity against P. falciparum in an in vitro experiment.

Plasmodium falciparum, the causative agent of the most serious form of malaria, infects about 5-10% of the world human population per year. It is well established that the erythrocytic stages of the malaria parasite rely mainly on glycolysis for their energy supply. In the present study, the glucose utilisation of erythrocyte population with parasitaemia levels similar to that of malaria patients was measured. The results allowed us to assess the effect of the parasites on the glucose utilisation of the vast majority of uninfected erythrocytes. Using [2-13C]glucose and nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) technique, the glucose utilisation in normal red blood cell (RBC) and P. falciparum infected red blood cell (IRBC) populations was measured. The IRBC population consisted of > 96% RBC and < 4% of parasite infected red blood cells (PRBC). The glycolytic enzymes were assayed to assess the effect of infected red cells on the enzymatic activities of uninfected ones. The rate of glucose utilisation by IRBC was considerably higher than that of RBC. Upon addition of 25% v/v conditioned culture medium (CM) of IRBC, RBCs exhibited a significant decrease in glucose utilisation. The CM could directly inhibit the activities of RBC glycolytic enzymes-phosphofructokinase (PFK) and pyruvate kinase (PK), without interfering with the activity of the pentose phosphate pathway enzyme-glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G-6-PD). The present study showed that the clinical level of P. falciparum infected RBCs (< 4% parasitaemia) significantly enhance the glycolytic flux as well as down-regulate the glucose utilisation rate in the majority of uninfected RBC population. The mechanism of inhibition seems to be direct inhibition of the regulatory glycolytic enzymes-PFK and PK.

Plasmodium falciparum the main causative agent of malaria is an important public health vector. With the use of PCR, its genetic diversity has been extensively studied with dearth information from Nigeria. In this study, 100 P. falciparum strains merozoite surface protein 1(msp-1), merozoite surface protein 2 (msp-2) and Glutamate rich protein (Glurp) from Ogun State General Hospitals were characterized. The genetic diversity of P. falciparum isolates was analyzed by restriction fragment length polymorphism following gel electrophoresis of DNA products from nested polymerase chain reactions (PCR) of their respective allelic families KI, MAD 20, RO33 (MSP-1);FC27, 3D7 (MSP-2) and Glutamate rich protein respectively. Majority of the patients showed monoclonal infections while multiplicity of the infection for msp-1 and msp-2 were 1.1 and 1.2 respectively. The estimated number of genotypes was 8 msp-1 (4 KI; 3 MAD; 1 RO33) and 6 msp-2 (3 FC27; 3 3D7). 80% of the isolates coded for Glurp with allelic size ranged between 700 and 900 bp. The allelic distributions however were similar to those previously reported in other endemic malaria countries. Future studies will be designed to include other malaria endemic regions of Nigeria such as the oil exploration regions.

Plasmodium falciparum, the causative agent of the most lethal form of human malaria, is incapable of de novo purine synthesis, and thus, purine acquisition from the host is an indispensable nutritional requirement. This purine salvage process is initiated by the transport of preformed purines into the parasite. We have identified a gene encoding a nucleoside transporter from P. falciparum, PfNT1, and analyzed its function and expression during intraerythrocytic parasite development. PfNT1 predicts a polypeptide of 422 amino acids with 11 transmembrane domains that is homologous to other members of the equilibrative nucleoside transporter family. Southern analysis and BLAST searching of The Institute for Genomic Research (TIGR) malaria data base indicate that PfNT1 is a single copy gene located on chromosome 14. Northern analysis of RNA from intraerythrocytic stages of the parasite demonstrates that PfNT1 is expressed throughout the asexual life cycle but is significantly elevated during the early trophozoite stage. Functional expression of PfNT1 in Xenopus laevis oocytes significantly increases their ability to take up naturally occurring D-adenosine (K(m) = 13.2 microM) and D-inosine (K(m) = 253 microM). Significantly, PfNT1, unlike the mammalian nucleoside transporters, also has the capacity to transport the stereoisomer L-adenosine (K(m) > 500 microM). Inhibition studies with a battery of purine and pyrimidine nucleosides and bases as well as their analogs indicate that PfNT1 exhibits a broad substrate specificity for purine and pyrimidine nucleosides. These data provide compelling evidence that PfNT1 encodes a functional purine/pyrimidine nucleoside transporter whose expression is strongly developmentally regulated in the asexual stages of the P. falciparum life cycle. Moreover, the unusual ability to transport L-adenosine and the vital contribution of purine transport to parasite survival makes PfNT1 an attractive target for therapeutic evaluation.

A putative glutathione peroxidase gene (Swiss-Prot accession number Z 68200) of Plasmodium falciparum, the causative agent of tropical malaria, was expressed in Escherichia coli and purified to electrophoretic homogeneity. Like phospholipid hydroperoxide glutathione peroxidase of mammals, it proved to be monomeric. It was active with H(2)O(2) and organic hydroperoxides but, unlike phospholipid hydroperoxide glutathione peroxidase, not with phosphatidylcholine hydroperoxide. With glutathione peroxidases it shares the ping-pong mechanism with infinite V(max) and K(m) when analyzed with GSH as substrate. As a homologue with selenocysteine replaced by cysteine, its reactions with hydroperoxides and GSH are 3 orders of magnitude slower than those of the selenoperoxidases. Unexpectedly, the plasmodial enzyme proved to react faster with thioredoxins than with GSH and most efficiently with thioredoxin of P. falciparum (Swiss-Prot accession number 202664). It is therefore reclassified as thioredoxin peroxidase. With plasmodial thioredoxin, the enzyme also displays ping-pong kinetics, yet with a limiting K(m) of 10 microm and a k(1)' of 0.55 s(-)1. The apparent k(1)' for oxidation with cumene, t-butyl, and hydrogen peroxides are 2.0 x 10(4) m(-1) s(-1), 3.3 x 10(3) m(-1) s(-1), and 2.5 x 10(3) m (-1) s(-1), respectively. k(2)' for reduction by autologous thioredoxin is 5.4 x 10(4) m(-1) s(-1) (21.2 m(-1) s(-1) for GSH). The newly discovered enzymatic function of the plasmodial gene product suggests a reconsideration of its presumed role in parasitic antioxidant defense.

Centromeres are essential for the faithful transmission of chromosomes to the next generation, therefore being essential in all eukaryotic organisms. The centromeres of Plasmodium falciparum, the causative agent of the most severe form of malaria, have been broadly mapped on most chromosomes, but their epigenetic composition remained undefined. Here, we reveal that the centromeric histone variant PfCENH3 occupies a 4-4.5 kb region on each P. falciparum chromosome, which is devoid of pericentric heterochromatin but harbours another histone variant, PfH2A.Z. These CENH3 covered regions pinpoint the exact position of the centromere on all chromosomes and revealed that all centromeric regions have similar size and sequence composition. Immunofluorescence assay of PfCENH3 strongly suggests that P. falciparum centromeres cluster to a single nuclear location prior to and during mitosis and cytokinesis but dissociate soon after invasion. In summary, we reveal a dynamic association of Plasmodium centromeres, which bear a unique epigenetic signature and conform to a strict structure. These findings suggest that DNA-associated and epigenetic elements play an important role in centromere establishment in this important human pathogen.

Plasmodium falciparum, the causative agent of the most lethal form of human malaria, uses multiple ligand-receptor interactions to invade host red blood cells (RBCs). We studied the invasion of P falciparum into abnormal RBCs from humans carrying the Southeast Asian ovalocytosis (SAO) trait. One particular parasite line, 3D7-A, invaded these cells efficiently, whereas all other lines studied invaded SAO RBCs to only about 20% of the extent of normal (non-SAO) cells. This result is consistent with the clinical observation that SAO individuals can experience high-density P falciparum infections and provides an explanation for previous discrepant results on invasion of SAO RBCs. Characterization of the invasion phenotype of 3D7-A revealed that efficient invasion of SAO RBCs was paralleled by relatively efficient invasion of normal RBCs treated with either neuraminidase, trypsin, or chymotrypsin and a novel capacity to invade normal RBCs treated sequentially with both neuraminidase and trypsin. Our results suggest that only parasites able to use some particular invasion pathways can invade SAO RBCs efficiently in culture. A similar situation might occur in the field.

Cerebral involvement in parasitoses is an important clinical manifestation of most of the human parasitoses. Parasites that have been described to affect the central nervous system (CNS), either as the dominant or as a collateral feature, include cestodes (Taenia solium (neurocysticerciasis), Echinococcus granulosus (cerebral cystic echinococcosis), E. multilocularis (cerebral alveolar echinococcosis), Spirometra mansoni (neurosparganosis)), nematodes (Toxocara canis and T. cati (neurotoxocariasis), Trichinella spiralis (neurotrichinelliasis), Angiostrongylus cantonensis and A. costaricensis (neuroangiostrongyliasis), Gnathostoma spinigerum (gnathostomiasis)), trematodes (Schistosoma mansoni (cerebral bilharziosis), Paragonimus westermani (neuroparagonimiasis)), or protozoa (Toxoplasma gondii (neurotoxoplasmosis), Acanthamoeba spp. or Balamuthia mandrillaris (granulomatous amoebic encephalitis), Naegleria (primary amoebic meningo-encephalitis), Entamoeba histolytica (brain abscess), Plasmodium falciparum (cerebral malaria), Trypanosoma brucei gambiense/rhodesiense (sleeping sickness) or Trypanosoma cruzi (cerebral Chagas disease)). Adults or larvae of helminths or protozoa enter the CNS and cause meningitis, encephalitis, ventriculitis, myelitis, ischaemic stroke, bleeding, venous thrombosis or cerebral abscess, clinically manifesting as headache, epilepsy, weakness, cognitive decline, impaired consciousness, confusion, coma or focal neurological deficits. Diagnosis of cerebral parasitoses is dependent on the causative agent. Available diagnostic tools include clinical presentation, blood tests (eosinophilia, plasmodia in blood smear, antibodies against the parasite), cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) investigations, imaging findings and occasionally cerebral biopsy. Treatment relies on drugs and sometimes surgery. Outcome of cerebral parasitoses is highly variable, depending on the effect of drugs, whether they are self-limiting (e.g. Angiostrongylus costaricensis) or whether they remain undetected or asymptomatic, like 25% of neurocysticerciasis cases.

Chloroquine has been the mainstay of antimalarial chemotherapy but the rapid spread of resistance to this important drug has now compromised its efficacy. The mechanism of chloroquine resistance has not been known but recent evidence from Plasmodium falciparum, the causative agent of the most severe form of human malaria, suggested similarities to the multidrug resistance phenotype (MDR) of mammalian tumour cells which is mediated by a protein molecule termed P-glycoprotein. Two mdr genes (pfmdr1 and pfmdr2) encoding P-glycoprotein homologues have been identified in P. falciparum and one of these (pfmdr1) has several alleles that have been linked to the chloroquine resistance phenotype. In contrast analysis of a genetic cross between chloroquine-resistant and -sensitive P. falciparum has suggested that the genes encoding the known P-glycoprotein homologues are not linked. This review outlines the similarities of the chloroquine resistance phenotype with the MDR phenotype of mammalian tumour cells and explores the possible role of the pfmdr genes.

Understanding gene regulation in Plasmodium, the causative agent of malaria, is an important step in deciphering its complex life cycle as well as leading to possible new targets for therapeutic applications. Very little is known about gene regulation in Plasmodium, and in particular, few regulatory elements have been identified. Such discovery has been significantly hampered by the high A-T content of some of the genomes of Plasmodium species, as well as the challenge in associating discovered regulatory elements to gene regulatory cascades due to Plasmodium's complex life cycle. We report a new method of using comparative genomics to systematically discover motifs in Plasmodium without requiring any functional data. Different from previous methods, our method does not depend on sequence alignments, and thus is particularly suitable for highly divergent genomes. We applied our method to discovering regulatory motifs between the human parasite, P.falciparum, and its rodent-infectious relative, P.yoelii. We also tested our procedure against comparisons between P.falciparum and the primate-infectious, P.knowlesi. Our computational effort leads to an initial catalog of 38 distinct motifs, corresponding to over 16 200 sites in the Plasmodium genome. The functionality of these motifs was further supported by their defined distribution within the genome as well as a correlation with gene expression patterns. This initial map provides a systematic view of gene regulation in Plasmodium, which can be refined as additional genomes become available. The new algorithm, named motif discovery using orthologous sequences (MDOS), is available at http://www.ics.uci.edu/ approximately xhx/project/mdos/.

Plasmodium falciparum, the causative agent of the fatal form of malaria, synthesizes GMP primarily from IMP and, hence, needs active GMPS (GMP synthetase) for its survival. GMPS, a G-type amidotransferase, catalyses the amination of XMP to GMP with the reaction occurring in two domains, the GAT (glutamine amidotransferase) and ATPPase (ATP pyrophosphatase). The GAT domain hydrolyses glutamine to glutamate and ammonia, while the ATPPase domain catalyses the formation of the intermediate AMP-XMP from ATP and XMP. Co-ordination of activity across the two domains, achieved through channelling of ammonia from GAT to the effector domain, is the hallmark of amidotransferases. Our studies aimed at understanding the kinetic mechanism of PfGMPS (Plasmodium falciparum GMPS) indicated steady-state ordered binding of ATP followed by XMP to the ATPPase domain with glutamine binding in a random manner to the GAT domain. We attribute the irreversible, Ping Pong step seen in initial velocity kinetics to the release of glutamate before the attack of the adenyl-XMP intermediate by ammonia. Specific aspects of the overall kinetic mechanism of PfGMPS are different from that reported for the human and Escherichia coli enzymes. Unlike human GMPS, absence of tight co-ordination of activity across the two domains was evident in the parasite enzyme. Variations seen in the inhibition by nucleosides and nucleotide analogues between human GMPS and PfGMPS highlighted differences in ligand specificity that could serve as a basis for the design of specific inhibitors. The present study represents the first report on recombinant His-tagged GMPS from parasitic protozoa.

Plasmodium falciparum, the causative agent of the most lethal form of human malaria, totally depends on de novo pyrimidine biosynthetic pathway. Orotate phosphoribosyltransferase (OPRT) and orotidine 5'-monophosphate decarboxylase (OMPDC), the fifth and sixth enzymes in the pathway catalyzing formation of uridine 5'-monophosphate (UMP), remain largely uncharacterized in the protozoan parasite. In this study, we achieved purification of OPRT and OMPDC to near homogeneity from P. falciparum cultivated in vitro. The OPRT and OMPDC activities were co-eluted in all chromatographic columns during purification, suggesting the purified proteins exist as a multienzyme complex with a molecular mass of 140+/-8 kDa and contain two subunits each of OPRT and OMPDC. Monomeric forms of OPRT and OMPDC had molecular masses of 32+/-3 and 38+/-3 kDa, respectively, in agreement with those of proteins predicted from P. falciparum genome database. Interestingly, kinetic parameters and inhibitory constants of both OPRT and OMPDC activities were found to be different to those of the bifunctional human red cell UMP synthase. Our evidence provides the first example of OPRT and OMPDC existing as a multienzyme complex.

Plasmodium falciparum, the causative agent of human malaria, expresses two aminopeptidases, PfM1AAP and PfM17LAP, critical to generating a free amino acid pool used by the intraerythrocytic stage of the parasite for proteins synthesis, growth and development. These exopeptidases are potential targets for the development of a new class of anti-malaria drugs. To define the substrate specificity of recombinant forms of these two malaria aminopeptidases we used a new library consisting of 61 fluorogenic substrates derived both from natural and unnatural amino acids. We obtained a detailed substrate fingerprint for recombinant forms of the enzymes revealing that PfM1AAP exhibits a very broad substrate tolerance, capable of efficiently hydrolyzing neutral and basic amino acids, while PfM17LAP has narrower substrate specificity and preferentially cleaves bulky, hydrophobic amino acids. The substrate library was also exploited to profile the activity of the native aminopeptidases in soluble cell lysates of P. falciparum malaria. This data showed that PfM1AAP and PfM17LAP are responsible for majority of the aminopeptidase activity in these extracts. These studies provide specific substrate and mechanistic information important for understanding the function of these aminopeptidases and could be exploited in the design of new inhibitors to specifically target these for anti-malaria treatment.

Apical membrane antigen 1 (AMA1) is an asexual blood-stage protein expressed in the invasive merozoite form of Plasmodia species, which are the causative agent of malaria. We have complemented the function of Plasmodium falciparum AMA1 (PfAMA1) with a divergent AMA1 transgene from Plasmodium chabaudi (PcAMA1). It was not possible to disrupt the PfAMA1 gene using 'knock-out' plasmids, although we demonstrate that the PfAMA1 gene can be targeted by homologous recombination. These experiments suggest that PfAMA1 is critical, perhaps essential, for blood-stage growth. Importantly, we showed that PcAMA1 expression in P. falciparum provides trans-species complementation to at least 35% of the function of endogenous PfAMA1 in human red cells. Furthermore, expression of this transgene in P. falciparum leads to more efficient invasion of murine erythrocytes. These results indicate an important role for AMA1 in the invasion of red blood cells (RBCs) across divergent Plasmodium species.

A three-dimensional structure of histo-aspartic protease (HAP), a pepsin-like enzyme from the causative agent of malaria Plasmodium falciparum, is suggested on the basis of homologous modeling followed by equilibration by the method of molecular dynamics. The presence of a His residue in the catalytic site instead of an Asp residue, which is characteristic of pepsin-like enzymes, and replacement of some other conserved residues in the active site make it possible for the enzyme to function by the covalent mechanism inherent in serine proteases. The detailed structures of HAP complexes with pepstatin, a noncovalent inhibitor of aspartic proteases, and phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, a covalent inhibitor of serine proteases, as well as with a pentapeptide substrate are discussed.

Plasmodium vivax is an important human pathogen causing malaria in more temperate climates of the world. Similar to Plasmodium falciparum, the causative agent for malaria tropica, drug resistance is beginning to emerge for this parasite species and this hampers adequate treatment of infection. We have used a short-term ex vivo drug assay to monitor activity of OZ277 (RBx-11160), a fully synthetic anti-malarial peroxide, and the diamidine DB75 against P. vivax. For both compounds as well as the anti-malarial reference compounds artesunate, artemether, and chloroquine, the in vitro IC(50) values were determined in one-cycle hypoxanthine incorporation assays. Results from such assays were found to be very similar compared to IC(50) values obtained from one-cycle P. falciparum hypoxanthine assays. We demonstrate the anti-parasite activity of OZ277 and the reference compounds to be faster than that of DB75. These data warrant clinical testing of OZ277 against P. vivax malaria and support recent data on clinical activity against P. vivax for DB75.

In Plasmodium falciparum, the causative agent of cerebral malaria, silent information regulator 2 (Sir2) has been implicated in pathogenesis through its role in var gene silencing. P. falciparum Sir2 (PfSir2) in addition to the catalytic core, has a 13 residue N-terminal and 4 residue C-terminal extension over the shorter Archaeoglobus fulgidus Sir2. In this paper, we highlight our studies aimed at understanding the kinetic mechanism of PfSir2 and the role of N- and C-terminal extensions in protein function and oligomerization. Bisubstrate kinetic analysis showed that PfSir2 exhibits a rapid equilibrium ordered sequential mechanism, with peptide binding preceding NAD(+). This study also reports on surfactin as a novel Sir2 inhibitor exhibiting competitive inhibition with respect to NAD(+) and uncompetitive inhibition with acetylated peptide. This inhibition pattern with surfactin provides further support for ordered binding of substrates. Surfactin was also found to be a potent inhibitor of intra-erythrocytic growth of P. falciparum with 50% inhibitory concentration in the low micromolar range. PfSir2, like the yeast homologs (yHst2 and Sir2p), is a trimer in solution. However, dissociation of trimer to monomers in the presence of NAD(+) is characteristic of the parasite enzyme. Oligomerization studies on N- and/or C-terminal deletion constructs of PfSir2 highlight the role of C-terminus of the protein in mediating homotrimerization. N-terminal deletion resulted in reduced catalytic efficiency although substrate affinity was not altered in the constructs. Interestingly, deletion of both the ends relaxed NAD(+) specificity.

The causative agent of malaria, Plasmodium falciparum posses a single aquaglyceroporin (PfAQP) which represents a potential drug target for treatment of the disease. PfAQP is localized to the parasite membrane to transport water, glycerol, ammonia and possibly glycolytic intermediates. In order to enable design of inhibitors we set out to determine the 3D structure of PfAQP, where the first bottleneck to overcome is achieving high enough yield of recombinant protein. The wild type PfAQP gene was expressed to low or undetectable levels in the expression hosts, Escherichia coli and Pichia pastoris, which was assumed to be due to different genomic A+T content and different codon usage. Thus, two codon-optimized PfAQP genes were generated. The Opt-PfAQP for E. coli still did not result in high production yields, possibly due to folding problems. However, PfAQP optimized for P. pastoris was successfully expressed in P. pastoris for production and in Saccharomyces cerevisiae for functional studies. In S. cerevisiae, PfAQP mediated glycerol transport but unexpectedly water transport could not be confirmed. Following high-level membrane-localized expression in P. pastoris (estimated to 64mg PfAQP per liter cell culture) PfAQP was purified to homogeneity (18mg/L) and initial attempts at crystallization of the protein yielded several different forms.

Despite vast efforts and expenditures in the past few decades, malaria continues to kill millions of persons every year, and new approaches for disease control are urgently needed. To complete its life cycle in the mosquito, Plasmodium, the causative agent of malaria, has to traverse the epithelia of the midgut and salivary glands. Although strong circumstantial evidence indicates that parasite interactions with the two organs are specific, hardly any information is available about the interacting molecules. By use of a phage display library, we identified a 12-aa peptide--salivary gland and midgut peptide 1 (SM1)--that binds to the distal lobes of the salivary gland and to the luminal side of the midgut epithelium, but not to the midgut surface facing the hemolymph or to ovaries. The coincidence of the tissues with which parasites and the SM1 peptide interact suggested that the parasite and peptide recognize the same surface ligand. In support of this hypothesis, the SM1 peptide strongly inhibited Plasmodium invasion of salivary gland and midgut epithelia. These experiments suggest a new strategy for the genetic manipulation of mosquito vectorial capacity.

Of the 5,484 predicted proteins of Plasmodium falciparum, the main causative agent of malaria, about 60% do not have sufficient sequence similarity with proteins in other organisms to warrant provision of functional assignments. Non-homology methods are thus needed to obtain functional clues for these uncharacterized genes. We present PlasmoDraft http://atgc.lirmm.fr/PlasmoDraft/, a database of Gene Ontology (GO) annotation predictions for P. falciparum genes based on postgenomic data. Predictions of PlasmoDraft are achieved with a Guilt By Association method named Gonna. This involves (1) a predictor that proposes GO annotations for a gene based on the similarity of its profile (measured with transcriptome, proteome or interactome data) with genes already annotated by GeneDB; (2) a procedure that estimates the confidence of the predictions achieved with each data source; (3) a procedure that combines all data sources to provide a global summary and confidence estimate of the predictions. Gonna has been applied to all P. falciparum genes using most publicly available transcriptome, proteome and interactome data sources. Gonna provides predictions for numerous genes without any annotations. For example, 2,434 genes without any annotations in the Biological Process ontology are associated with specific GO terms (e.g. Rosetting, Antigenic variation), and among these, 841 have confidence values above 50%. In the Cellular Component and Molecular Function ontologies, 1,905 and 1,540 uncharacterized genes are associated with specific GO terms, respectively (740 and 329 with confidence value above 50%). All predictions along with their confidence values have been compiled in PlasmoDraft, which thus provides an extensive database of GO annotation predictions that can be achieved with these data sources. The database can be accessed in different ways. A global view allows for a quick inspection of the GO terms that are predicted with high confidence, depending on the various data sources. A gene view and a GO term view allow for the search of potential GO terms attached to a given gene, and genes that potentially belong to a given GO term.

The feasibility was determined of influencing Ae. aegypti sensitivity to bird malaria agent P. gallinaceum by sublethal concentrations of herbicides (ordram and propanide) and fungicides (fundozol and blue vitriol) introduced into the larvae habitation medium or into the imago feed. No stable changes in the infectivity of test female individuals, as compared to the control, have been observed. Specific action of the group of preparations under study has been noted. It has been shown that the use of herbicides causes a decrease in some parameters of the vector potential (survival and aggressiveness) of the survived insects, however, it is accompanied by a tendency towards enhanced invasion by malaria plasmodia. The treatment of larvae with fungicides has less effect on the viability of the imago and their reaction to the prey, however, unlike herbicides, fungicides are associated with a tendency towards reduced Ae. aegypti sensitivity to P. gallinaceum. When fungicides are added to the imago feed the indexes of test female individuals infectivity do not differ from the control ones.

Thioredoxin reductase (TrxR) is the homodimeric flavoenzyme that catalyzes reduction of thioredoxin disulfide (Trx). For Plasmodium falciparum, a causative agent of tropical malaria, TrxR is an essential protein which has been validated as a drug target. The high-throughput screening of 350000 compounds has identified Mannich bases as a new class of TrxR mechanism-based inhibitors. During catalysis, TrxR conducts reducing equivalents from the NADPH-reduced flavin to Trx via the two redox-active cysteine pairs, Cys88-Cys93 and Cys535'-Cys540', referred to as N-terminal and C-terminal cysteine pairs. The structures of unsaturated Mannich bases suggested that they could act as bisalkylating agents leading to a macrocycle that involves both C-terminal cysteines of TrxR. To confirm this hypothesis, different Mannich bases possessing one or two electrophilic centers were synthesized and first studied in detail using glutathione as a model thiol. Michael addition of glutathione to the double bond of an unsaturated Mannich base (3a) occurs readily at physiological pH. Elimination of the amino group, promoted by base-catalyzed enolization of the ketone, is followed by addition of a second nucleophile. The intermediate formed in this reaction is an alpha,beta-unsaturated ketone that can react rapidly with a second thiol. When studying TrxR as a target of Mannich bases, we took advantage of the fact that the charge-transfer complex formed between the thiolate of Cys88 and the flavin in the reduced enzyme can be observed spectroscopically. The data show that it is the C-terminal Cys 535'-Cys540' pair rather than the N-terminal Cys88-Cys93 pair that is modified by the inhibitor. Although alkylated TrxR is unable to turn over its natural substrate Trx, it can reduce low M(r) electron acceptors such as methyl methanethiolsulfonate by using its unmodified N-terminal thiols. On the basis of results with chemically distinct Mannich bases, a detailed mechanism for the inactivation of TrxR is proposed.

Acyl Carrier Protein (ACP) has a single reactive sulfhydryl necessary for function in covalently binding nascent fatty acids during biosynthesis. In Plasmodium falciparum, the causative agent of the most lethal form of malaria, fatty acid biosynthesis occurs in the apicoplast organelle during the liver stage of the parasite life cycle. During the blood stage, fatty acid biosynthesis is inactive and the redox state of the apicoplast has not been determined. We solved the crystal structure of ACP from P. falciparum in reduced and disulfide-linked forms, and observe the surprising result that the disulfide in the PfACP cross-linked dimer is sequestered from bulk solvent in a tight molecular interface. We assessed solvent accessibility of the disulfide with small molecule reducing agents and found that the disulfide is protected from BME but less so for other common reducing agents. We examined cultured P. falciparum parasites to determine which form of PfACP is prevalent during the blood stages. We readily detected monomeric PfACP in parasite lysate, but do not observe the disulfide-linked form, even under conditions of oxidative stress. To demonstrate that PfACP contains a free sulfhydryl and is not acylated or in the apo state, we treated blood stage parasites with the disulfide forming reagent diamide. We found that the effects of diamide are reversed with reducing agent. Together, these results suggest that the apicoplast is a reducing compartment, as suggested by models of P. falciparum metabolism, and that PfACP is maintained in a reduced state during blood stage growth.

The problem of drug resistance of Plasmodium falciparum, the causative agent of tropical malaria and its role in the general system of malaria control are discussed. The aspects of distribution of drug resistant strains of P. falciparum and the main principles of determination of the malaria causative agent sensitivity to antimalaria drugs are presented. The determination implies the use of various procedures for performing the tests under clinical conditions in vivo and various modifications of the in vitro tests, as well as estimation of their results. The use of a 48-hour in vitro test provided the revealing of certain advantages of dabequine, a new drug made in the USSR in comparison to chloroquine with respect to drug resistant strains of P. falciparum from the southern areas of Vietnam. The advantages and disadvantages or limitations of every procedure in comparison to the others are indicated and it is shown that the in vivo and in vitro tests are supplementing each other. The known procedures provide the results not earlier than in 24-48 hours which required developing of a rapid procedure. Brief characteristics of a rapid biochemical procedure are presented. This procedure was developed at the E. I. Martsinovsky Institute of Medical Parasitology and Tropical Medicine on an experimental model of P. berghei, the causative agent of rodent malaria. It provides the results in 4-5 hours.

The gene of an NADP+-specific glutamate dehydrogenase was cloned from Plasmodium falciparum, the causative agent of tropical malaria. Southern-blot analysis indicates a single-copy gene. The gene encodes a protein with 470 residues which has 50% of all residues identical with those of the glutamate dehydrogenases from other low eukaryotes and eubacteria. In contrast, the sequence identity with the human enzyme is marginal, which underlines the long evolutionary distance between parasite and host. The gene was overexpressed in Escherichia coli. The kinetic properties of the recombinant enzyme are in good agreement with those of the authentic enzyme. The parasite enzyme is inhibited by D-glutamate and glutarate, but not by chloroquine. Like other coenzyme-specific glutamate dehydrogenases, but in contrast to the dual-specific mammalian enzymes, the P. falciparum enzyme is not affected by GTP and ADP. The physical and chemical properties of the protein are in accordance with the cytosol being the major localization. The gene does not encode a cleavable mitochondrial presequence and the Mr of the recombinant protein and the protein isolated from the parasite are indistinguishable on SDS/PAGE. Western-blot analysis of stage-specific parasites shows that glutamate dehydrogenase is present in all intraerythrocytic stages. The signal increased continuously from rings, early trophozoites to late trophozoites and decreased slightly in the segmenter stage. Glutamate dehydrogenase, suggested to be the major source of NADPH in the parasite, is an attractive target molecule for the rational development of new antimalarial drugs.

We have previously showed alterations in the thymus during experimental infection with Plasmodium berghei, the causative agent of Malaria. Such alterations comprised histological changes with loss of delimitation between cortical and medullar regions, a profound atrophy with depletion of CD4(+)CD8(+) double-positive (DP) thymocytes, and severe changes in the expression of cell migration-related molecules, belonging to the extracellular matrix and chemokine protein families. Taken together, these considerations prompted us to evaluate if the acute thymic atrophy observed during Plasmodium infection was correlated with increased apoptotic levels of thymocytes or with their premature emigration to the periphery. Our results confirmed that the marked reduction of the thymus weight in infected animals was accompanied by histological alterations, which included a very large number of cells showing nuclear condensation and karyorrhectic changes surrounded by histiocytes suggesting increased levels of apoptosis. This was confirmed by immunohistochemistry and flow cytometry techniques. In order to verify if an accelerated emigration of thymic cells to the peripheral lymphoid organs was also occurring we analyzed the spleen and mesenteric lymph nodes from control and infected mice. No significant differences were found in the spleen, but were seen after 14 days of infection between control and infected mice in the mesenteric lymph nodes. The main alteration was the presence of double negative (CD4(-)CD8(-)) and double positive (CD4(+)CD8(+)) cells. We concluded that both apoptosis of thymocytes and premature egress of immature cells take place during infection. Additional studies will be necessary to verify how such alterations might influence the systemic immune response to the parasite.

Mosquitos Ae. aegypti and An. stephensi contact with sublethal doses of deltametrin and cypermetrin pyretroids at larval stage and in grown state, when diet includes sugar with pyretroids, had no influence on the sensitivity of survived females to malaria agents P. gallinaceum and P. berghei. Mosquitos under experiment showed no obvious inhibition of the physiological condition in comparison with the control ones.

Ferroquine (FQ or SR97193) is a novel antimalarial drug candidate, currently in development at Sanofi-Aventis. In contrast to conventional drugs, FQ is the first organometallic drug: a ferrocenyl group covalently flanked by a 4-aminoquinoline and a basic alkylamine. FQ is able to overcome the CQ resistance problem, an important limit to the control of Plasmodium falciparum, the principal causative agent of malaria. After fifteen years of effort, it is now possible to propose a multifactorial mechanism of action of FQ by its capacity to target lipids, to inhibit the formation of hemozoin and to generate reactive oxygen species.

Trypanosomes do not inhabit or grow in anopheles mosquitoes, the vector for the transmission of Plasmodium parasites the causative agent for malaria. The possession of lytic factors by the anopheline mosquito was thus considered. Head and midgut sections prepared in phosphate buffered saline were tested for trypanocidal action against T. congolense. While the head section was inactive towards the trypanosomes, the midgut extract at 0.2 mg ml(-1) diminished the motility of the parasites within 2 min of incubation; killing 50% of the population after 5 min. At 0.5 mg ml(-1) of the extract, about 90% of the parasites were killed within 2 min of incubation. The midgut fraction was subjected to a purification protocol involving successive chromatography on: octyl-sepharose, reactive brown agarose and fetuin-agarose columns. A final trypanocidal active fraction (gp45), which moved homogeneously during electrophoresis as a 45-kDa protein, was recovered from the fetuin-agarose column. The protein reacted positively with thiobarbituric acid, which suggests it is a sialoglycoprotein. Desialylation of the glycoprotein nullified its trypanocidal activity on T. congolense. Similarly, when the saccharides, lactose, methyl-beta-galactoside, lactulose, methyl-umbelliferyl-beta-galactoside (MU-Gal), were included in the culture medium, they inhibited the gp45 trypanocidal activity. Asialo-fetuin and asialo-RBC also inhibited the gp45-induced killing of T. congolense cells. The potential use of anopheline 45 kDa protein in the production of transgenic tsetse flies (Glossina spp.) in the control of trypanosomiasis is discussed.

The lack of repeated bloodsucking does not affect essentially the infection of Ae. aegypti mosquitoes with malaria agent, P. gallinaceum.

Techniques for targeted genetic disruption in Plasmodium, the causative agent of malaria, are currently intractable for those genes that are essential for blood stage development. The ability to use RNA interference (RNAi) to silence gene expression would provide a powerful means to gain valuable insight into the pathogenic blood stages but its functionality in Plasmodium remains controversial. Here we have used various RNA-based gene silencing approaches to test the utility of RNAi in malaria parasites and have undertaken an extensive comparative genomics search using profile hidden Markov models to clarify whether RNAi machinery exists in malaria. These investigative approaches revealed that Plasmodium lacks the enzymology required for RNAi-based ablation of gene expression and indeed no experimental evidence for RNAi was observed. In its absence, the most likely explanations for previously reported RNAi-mediated knockdown are either the general toxicity of introduced RNA (with global down-regulation of gene expression) or a specific antisense effect mechanistically distinct from RNAi, which will need systematic analysis if it is to be of use as a molecular genetic tool for malaria parasites.

The genome sequence of Plasmodium falciparum, the causative agent of the most severe form of malaria in humans, rapidly approaches completion, but our ability to genetically manipulate this organism remains limited. Chromosomal integration has only been achieved following the prolonged maintenance of circularised episomal plasmids which selects for single crossover recombinants. It has not been possible to construct genetic deletions via double crossover recombination, presumably due to the low frequency of this event. We have used the Herpes simplex virus thymidine kinase gene and the Escherichia coli cytosine deaminase gene for negative selection of P. falciparum. Parasites were transformed with plasmids expressing the thymidine kinase and cytosine deaminase genes by positive selection for the human dihydrofolate reductase gene. Parasites expressing thymidine kinase are susceptible to the pro-drug ganciclovir while those expressing cytosine deaminase are sensitive to 5-fluorocytosine. Parental parasites were inherently resistant to these drugs. A significant 'bystander effect' was evident in cultures with either ganciclovir or 5-fluorocytosine. Positive and negative selection of the thymidine kinase transformants with both ganciclovir and WR99210 resulted in the selection of parasites containing a genetic deletion of the Pfrh3 gene, the first targeted double crossover deletions in P. falciparum. The use of negative selection for gene disruptions via double crossover recombination will dramatically improve our ability to analyse protein function and opens the possibility of using this strategy for a variety of gene deletion and modification experiments in the analysis of this important infectious agent.

The contact of Aedes aegypti mosquitoes with DDT one hour prior to the infectious feeding results in a slight decrease of their susceptibility to Plasmodium gallinaceum. The contact 24 hours prior to the infectious feeding does not affect the susceptibility of mosquitoes.

On a model pair Aedes aegypti--Plasmodium gallinaceum in has been shown that changes in the conditions of larvae development caused by the addition into the water medium of the live culture of Synochocystis sp. cyanobacteria or green seaweeds Chlorella vulgaris, acetone extracts from the live culture precipitate or Chlorella powder, as well as nitrogen-containing fertilizer--ammonium chloride did not lower the sensitivity of the imago flying to malaria parasites. The results of the experiments assessing the effect of biologically active compounds introduced into the larvae habitation medium on the ability to change sensitivity of the survived mosquito females to malaria agent have been summed up. The data obtained are indicative of the high level of mutual adaptation between mosquito-carriers and malaria parasites.

Plasmodium falciparum is the causative agent of the most severe form of human malaria. The rapid multiplication of the parasite within human erythrocytes requires an active production of new membranes. Phosphatidylcholine is the most abundant phospholipid in Plasmodium membranes, and the pathways leading to its synthesis are attractive targets for chemotherapy. In addition to its synthesis from choline, phosphatidylcholine is synthesized from serine via an unknown pathway. Serine, which is actively transported by Plasmodium from human serum and readily available in the parasite, is subsequently converted into phosphoethanolamine. Here, we describe in P. falciparum a plant-like S-adenosyl-l-methionine-dependent three-step methylation reaction that converts phosphoethanolamine into phosphocholine, a precursor for the synthesis of phosphatidylcholine. We have identified the gene, PfPMT, encoding this activity and shown that its product is an unusual phosphoethanolamine methyltransferase with no human homologs. P. falciparum phosphoethanolamine methyltransferase (Pfpmt) is a monopartite enzyme with a single catalytic domain that is responsible for the three-step methylation reaction. Interestingly, Pfpmt activity is inhibited by its product phosphocholine and by the phosphocholine analog, miltefosine. We show that miltefosine can also inhibit parasite proliferation within human erythrocytes. The importance of this enzyme in P. falciparum membrane biogenesis makes it a potential target for malaria chemotherapy.

Malaria is a major human health problem and is responsible for over 2 million deaths per year. It is caused by a number of species of the genus Plasmodium, and Plasmodium falciparum is the causative agent of the most lethal form. Consequently, the development of a vaccine against this parasite is a priority. There are a number of stages of the parasite life cycle that are being targeted for the development of vaccines. Important candidate antigens include proteins on the surface of the asexual merozoite stage, the form that invades the host erythrocyte. The development of methods to manipulate the genome of Plasmodium species has enabled the construction of gain-of-function and loss-of-function mutants and provided new strategies to analyse the role of parasite proteins. This has provided new information on the role of merozoite antigens in erythrocyte invasion and also allows new approaches to address their potential as vaccine candidates.

Plasmodium falciparum, the causative agent of human malaria, is totally dependent on de novo pyrimidine biosynthetic pathway. A gene encoding P. falciparum dihydroorotase (pfDHOase) was cloned and expressed in Escherichia coli as monofunctional enzyme. PfDHOase revealed a molecular mass of 42kDa. In gel filtration chromatography, the major enzyme activity eluted at 40kDa, indicating that it functions in a monomeric form. This was similarly observed using the native enzyme purified from P. falciparum. Interestingly, kinetic parameters of the enzyme and inhibitory effect by orotate and its 5-substituted derivatives parallel that found in mammalian type I DHOase. Thus, the malarial enzyme shares characteristics of both type I and type II DHOases. This study provides the monofunctional property of the parasite DHOase lending further insights into its differences from the human enzyme which forms part of a multifunctional protein.

Insecticide-resistance threatens the control of mosquito-borne diseases like malaria or dengue fever. To ensure sustainable vector control we need a full understanding of the factors driving the evolution of resistance. We test the hypothesis that the expression of insecticide-resistance depends on the available resources by rearing genetically DDT-resistant and sensitive larvae of Anopheles mosquitoes at three diet regimes, which correspond to 40%, 70% and 100% of the normal diet and exposing the adult females to DDT 5, 10 and 15 days after emergence. In both colonies post-exposure survival decreased with age at exposure. Additionally, the food levels and DDT-resistance were positively correlated in both colonies, although only in the DDT-resistant one was this relationship statistically significant. The impact of larval diet was smaller than the effect of age at exposure. We discuss our results and explain the implication of this study to resistance monitoring for public health and vector management.

In Uganda, malaria and lymphatic filariasis (causative agent Wuchereria bancrofti) are transmitted by the same vector species of Anopheles mosquitoes, and thus are likely to share common environmental risk factors and overlap in geographical space. In a comprehensive nationwide survey in 2000-2003 the geographical distribution of W. bancrofti was assessed by screening school-aged children for circulating filarial antigens (CFA). Concurrently, blood smears were examined for malaria parasites. In this study, the resultant malariological data are analysed for the first time and the CFA data re-analysed in order to identify risk factors, produce age-stratified prevalence maps for each infection, and to define the geographical patterns of Plasmodium sp. and W. bancrofti co-endemicity. Logistic regression models were fitted separately for Plasmodium sp. and W. bancrofti within a Bayesian framework. Models contained covariates representing individual-level demographic effects, school-level environmental effects and location-based random effects. Several models were fitted assuming different random effects to allow for spatial structuring and to capture potential non-linearity in the malaria- and filariasis-environment relation. Model-based risk predictions at unobserved locations were obtained via Bayesian predictive distributions for the best fitting models. Maps of predicted hyper-endemic malaria and filariasis were furthermore overlaid in order to define areas of co-endemicity. Plasmodium sp. parasitaemia was found to be highly endemic in most of Uganda, with an overall population adjusted parasitaemia risk of 47.2% in the highest risk age-sex group (boys 5-9 years). High W. bancrofti prevalence was predicted for a much more confined area in northern Uganda, with an overall population adjusted infection risk of 7.2% in the highest risk age-group (14-19 year olds). Observed overall prevalence of individual co-infection was 1.1%, and the two infections overlap geographically with an estimated number of 212,975 children aged 5 - 9 years living in hyper-co-endemic transmission areas. The empirical map of malaria parasitaemia risk for Uganda presented in this paper is the first based on coherent, national survey data, and can serve as a baseline to guide and evaluate the continuous implementation of control activities. Furthermore, geographical areas of overlap with hyper-endemic W. bancrofti transmission have been identified to help provide a better informed platform for integrated control.

Babesiosis is a tick-borne disease caused by eukaryotic Babesia parasites which are morphologically similar to Plasmodium falciparum, the causative agent of malaria in humans. Like Plasmodium, different species of Babesia are tuned to infect different mammalian hosts, including rats, dogs, horses and cattle. Most species of Plasmodium and Babesia possess an essential bifunctional enzyme for nucleotide synthesis and folate metabolism: dihydrofolate reductase-thymidylate synthase. Although thymidylate synthase is highly conserved across organisms, the bifunctional form of this enzyme is relatively uncommon in nature. The structural characterization of dihydrofolate reductase-thymidylate synthase in Babesia bovis, the causative agent of babesiosis in livestock cattle, is reported here. The apo state is compared with structures that contain dUMP, NADP and two different antifolate inhibitors: pemetrexed and raltitrexed. The complexes reveal modes of binding similar to that seen in drug-resistant malaria strains and point to the utility of applying structural studies with proven cancer chemotherapies towards infectious disease research.

Malaria affects 200-300 million individuals per year worldwide. Plasmodium falciparum is the causative agent of the most severe and mortal type of malaria. The need for new antimalarials comes from the widespread resistance to those in current use. New antimalarial targets are required to increase chemical diversity and effectiveness of the drugs. The research for such new targets and drug chemotypes is aided by structure-based drug design. We present a model of the TBP-TFIIB complex from P. falciparum (pfTBP-pfTFIIB) and a detailed study of the interactions at the TBP-TFIIB interface. The model was built using standard methodology, optimized energetically and evaluated structurally. We carried out an analysis of the interface considering its evolution, available experimental data on TBP and TFIIB mutants, and the main conserved and non-conserved interactions. To support the perspective of using this complex as a new target for rational antimalarial design, we present the comparison of the pfTBP-pfTFIIB interface with its human homolog. Despite the high residue conservation at the interface, we identified a potential region, composed of species-specific residues that can be used for rational antimalarial design. Currently there are no antimalarial drugs targeted to stop the nuclear transcription process, a vital event for all replication stages of P. falciparum. Due to its absolute requirement in transcription initiation, we consider the pfTBP-pfTFIIB interface as a new potential target for novel antimalarial chemotypes.

A novel family of 1H-imidazol-2-yl-pyrimidine-4,6-diamines has been identified with potent activity against the erythrocyte-stage of Plasmodium falciparum (Pf), the most common causative agent of malaria. A systematic SAR study resulted in the identification of compound 40 which exhibits good potency against both wild-type and drug resistant parasites and exhibits good in vivo pharmacokinetic properties.

In tropical regions millions of people still live at risk of malaria infection. Indeed the emergence of resistance to chloroquine and other drugs in use in these areas reinforces the need to implement alternative prophylactic strategies. Genistein is a naturally occurring compound that is widely used as a food supplement and is thought to be effective in countering several pathologies. Results presented here show that genistein inhibits liver infection by the Plasmodium parasite, the causative agent of malaria. In vitro, genistein decreased the infection rates of both mouse and human hepatoma cells by inhibiting the early stages of the parasite's intracellular development. Oral or intraperitoneal administration of genistein decreased the liver parasite load of P. berghei-infected mice. Moreover, mice fed on a genistein-supplemented diet showed a significant reduction in Plasmodium liver infection as well as a reduced blood parasitemia and partial protection from severe disease. Since genistein is a safe, low-cost, natural compound that can be used permanently in a diet, we propose its use as a prophylactic agent against malaria for endemic populations and long-time travelers.

Plasmodium falciparum, the causative agent of malignant malaria, is among the most severe human infectious diseases. The closest known relative of P. falciparum is a chimpanzee parasite, Plasmodium reichenowi, of which one single isolate was previously known. The co-speciation hypothesis suggests that both parasites evolved separately from a common ancestor over the last 5-7 million years, in parallel with the divergence of their hosts, the hominin and chimpanzee lineages. Genetic analysis of eight new isolates of P. reichenowi, from wild and wild-born captive chimpanzees in Cameroon and Côte d'Ivoire, shows that P. reichenowi is a geographically widespread and genetically diverse chimpanzee parasite. The genetic lineage comprising the totality of global P. falciparum is fully included within the much broader genetic diversity of P. reichenowi. This finding is inconsistent with the co-speciation hypothesis. Phylogenetic analysis indicates that all extant P. falciparum populations originated from P. reichenowi, likely by a single host transfer, which may have occurred as early as 2-3 million years ago, or as recently as 10,000 years ago. The evolutionary history of this relationship may be explained by two critical genetic mutations. First, inactivation of the CMAH gene in the human lineage rendered human ancestors unable to generate the sialic acid Neu5Gc from its precursor Neu5Ac, and likely made humans resistant to P. reichenowi. More recently, mutations in the dominant invasion receptor EBA 175 in the P. falciparum lineage provided the parasite with preference for the overabundant Neu5Ac precursor, accounting for its extreme human pathogenicity.

The 23-megabase genome of Plasmodium falciparum, the causative agent of severe human malaria, contains ∼5300 genes, most of unknown function or lacking homologs in other organisms. Identification of these gene functions will help in the discovery of novel targets for the development of antimalarial drugs and vaccines. The P. falciparum genome is unusually A+T-rich, which hampers cloning and expressing these genes in heterologous systems for functional analysis. The large repertoire of genetic tools available for Saccharomyces cerevisiae makes this yeast an ideal system for large scale functional complementation analyses of parasite genes. Here, we report the construction of a cDNA library from P. knowlesi, which has a lower A+T content compared with P. falciparum. This library was applied in a yeast complementation assay to identify malaria genes involved in the decarboxylation of phosphatidylserine. Transformation of a psd1Δpsd2Δdpl1Δ yeast strain, defective in phosphatidylethanolamine synthesis, with the P. knowlesi library led to identification of a new parasite phosphatidylserine decarboxylase (PkPSD). Unlike phosphatidylserine decarboxylase enzymes from other eukaryotes that are tightly associated with membranes, the PkPSD enzyme expressed in yeast was equally distributed between membrane and soluble fractions. In vitro studies reveal that truncated forms of PkPSD are soluble and undergo auto-endoproteolytic maturation in a phosphatidylserine-dependent reaction that is inhibited by other anionic phospholipids. This study defines a new system for probing the function of Plasmodium genes by library-based genetic complementation and its usefulness in revealing new biochemical properties of encoded proteins.

Few studies have investigated the pathophysiologic mechanisms responsible for what seems to be a possible interaction between Plasmodium falciparum, the causative agent of malaria, and HIV-1 in dually infected patients. It has been shown that Plasmodium parasites detoxify heme molecules into a pigment called hemozoin (HZ), which can significantly modulate the immune system. The primary objective of this study was to determine whether exposure of human primary monocyte-derived macrophages (MDMs) to the malaria pigment influences the process of HIV-1 infection. We report here that HIV-1 replication is significantly diminished in HZ-loaded MDMs. The HZ-mediated reduction in virus replication is due to a block at a step in the virus life cycle occurring between the completion of full-length reverse transcripts and integration of viral DNA within the host chromosome. Understanding the pathological mechanisms involved in P. falciparum and HIV-1 co-infection is of high importance because of possible therapeutic ramifications.

In Plasmodium falciparum, the causative agent of human malaria, the catalytic subunit gene of cAMP-dependent protein kinase (Pfpka-c) exists as a single copy. Interestingly, its expression appears developmentally regulated, being at higher levels in the pathogenic asexual stages than in the sexual forms of parasite that are responsible for transmission to the mosquito vector. Within asexual parasites, PfPKA activity can be readily detected in schizonts. Similar to endogenous PKA activity of noninfected red blood cells, the parasite enzyme can be stimulated by cAMP and inhibited by protein kinase inhibitor.Importantly, ex vivo treatment of infected erythrocytes with the classical PKA-C inhibitor H89 leads to a block in parasite growth. This suggests that the PKA activities of infected red blood cells are essential for parasite multiplication. Finally, structural considerations suggest that drugs targeting the parasite, rather than the erythrocyte enzyme, might be developed that could help in the fight against malaria.

Infection by Plasmodium, the causative agent of malaria, is associated with hemolysis and therefore with release of hemoglobin from RBC. Under inflammatory conditions, cell-free hemoglobin can be oxidized, releasing its heme prosthetic groups and producing deleterious free heme. Here we demonstrate that survival of a Plasmodium-infected host relies strictly on its ability to prevent the cytotoxic effects of free heme via the expression of the heme-catabolyzing enzyme heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1; encoded by the Hmox1 gene). When infected with Plasmodium chabaudi chabaudi (Pcc), wild-type (Hmox1(+/+)) BALB/c mice resolved infection and restored homeostasis thereafter (0% lethality). In contrast, HO-1 deficient (Hmox1(-/-)) BALB/c mice developed a lethal form of hepatic failure (100% lethality), similar to the one occurring in Pcc-infected DBA/2 mice (75% lethality). Expression of HO-1 suppresses the pro-oxidant effects of free heme, preventing it from sensitizing hepatocytes to undergo TNF-mediated programmed cell death by apoptosis. This cytoprotective effect, which inhibits the development of hepatic failure in Pcc-infected mice without interfering with pathogen burden, is mimicked by pharmacological antioxidants such as N-acetylcysteine (NAC). When administered therapeutically, i.e., after Pcc infection, NAC suppressed the development of hepatic failure in Pcc-infected DBA/2 mice (0% lethality), without interfering with pathogen burden. In conclusion, we describe a mechanism of host defense against Plasmodium infection, based on tissue cytoprotection against free heme and limiting disease severity irrespectively of parasite burden.

Plasmodium falciparum is the causative agent of malaria tropica in man. Biochemical studies were focused on the asexual, intraerythrocytic stages of P. falciparum, because of their role in the clinical phase of the disease and the possibility of propagation in a cell culture system. In this report, we describe the in-culture labeling of malarial glycolipids and the analysis of their hydrophilic moieties. They were identified as glycosylphosphatidylinositols (GPIs) by: 1) labeling with [3H]mannose, [3H]glucosamine, and [3H]ethanolamine and 2) sensitivity toward glycosylphosphatidylinositol-specific phospholipase D, phospholipase A2, and nitrous acid. Malarial GPIs are shown to be unaffected by treatment with phosphatidylinositol-specific phospholipase C, regardless of prior treatment with mild base commonly used for inositol deacylation. Two candidates for putative GPI-anchor precursors to malarial membrane proteins with the structures ethanolamine-phosphate-6(Man alpha 1-2)Man alpha 1-2Man alpha 1-6Man alpha 1-4 GlcN-PI (Pfg1 alpha) and ethanolamine-phosphate-6Man alpha 1-2Man alpha 1-6Man-alpha 1-4-GlcN-PI (Pfg1 beta) were identified.

We have evaluated a technology called transcriptionally active PCR (TAP) for high throughput identification and prioritization of novel target antigens from genomic sequence data using the Plasmodium parasite, the causative agent of malaria, as a model. First, we adapted the TAP technology for the highly AT-rich Plasmodium genome, using well-characterized P. falciparum and P. yoelii antigens and a small panel of uncharacterized open reading frames from the P. falciparum genome sequence database. We demonstrated that TAP fragments encoding six well-characterized P. falciparum antigens and five well-characterized P. yoelii antigens could be amplified in an equivalent manner from both plasmid DNA and genomic DNA templates, and that uncharacterized open reading frames could also be amplified from genomic DNA template. Second, we showed that the in vitro expression of the TAP fragments was equivalent or superior to that of supercoiled plasmid DNA encoding the same antigen. Third, we evaluated the in vivo immunogenicity of TAP fragments encoding a subset of the model P. falciparum and P. yoelii antigens. We found that antigen-specific antibody and cellular immune responses induced by the TAP fragments in mice were equivalent or superior to those induced by the corresponding plasmid DNA vaccines. Finally, we developed and demonstrated proof-of-principle for an in vitro humoral immunoscreening assay for down-selection of novel target antigens. These data support the potential of a TAP approach for rapid high throughput functional screening and identification of potential candidate vaccine antigens from genomic sequence data.

This study describes the synergistic interaction of two calcium channel blockers, verapamil (VR) and SR33557 or fantofarone (SR), in reversing chloroquine resistance in Plasmodium falciparum, the causative agent of human malaria. The two calcium channel blockers exhibited an intrinsic antimalarial activity at 10 and 1 microM for verapamil and fantofarone, respectively. Isobolograms revealed that chloroquine and verapamil, and chloroquine and fantofarone, acted synergistically against chloroquine-resistant strains of P. falciparum. When used at subinhibitory concentrations, verapamil appeared 2 to 3 times more potent than fantofarone in reversing chloroquine resistance. Indeed, verapamil completely reversed the chloroquine resistance in P. falciparum, while fantofarone did so only partially. In the highly chloroquine-resistant strain FcB1, VR and SR acted synergistically to reverse CQ resistance, and the concentrations of VR used in these combinations could be reduced 10- or 100-fold (e.g. 100 nM and 10 nM) those required when this drug was used alone. In the moderately chloroquine-resistant strain K1, a combination of VR and SR for CQ resistance reversal allowed us to reduce the concentration of these chemosensitizers 1000- and 100-fold, respectively. The maximum tolerable plasma level beyond which side-effects occurred when using verapamil is 2.5 microM. Thus, the approach described, which allowed us to lower the doses of chemosensitizers, could well prevent toxic effects in humans and enlighten the advantages of polychemotherapy.

The polyamines putrescine, spermidine and spermine play an essential role in cell differentiation and proliferation. Inhibition of the rate-limiting enzymes of polyamine biosynthesis, ornithine decarboxylase (ODC) and S-adenosylmethionine decarboxylase (AdoMetDC), has been proposed as a therapeutic strategy against cancer and parasitic infections. In the case of Plasmodium falciparum, the causative agent of malaria tropica, this approach is especially interesting, because here both key enzymes, ODC and AdoMetDC, are combined in a bifunctional protein, ODC/AdoMetDC. This arrangement has not been found in any other organism investigated so far. We report the cloning and recombinant expression of the ODC domain of P. falciparum in Escherichia coli. First, we expressed the mere recombinant ODC domain (rPfODC). Secondly, we expressed the recombinant ODC domain in conjunction with the preceding part of the hinge region of the bifunctional ODC/AdoMetDC (rPfHinge-ODC). K(m) values for L-ornithine were 47.3 microM for the rPfHinge-ODC and 161. 5 microM for the rPfODC. Both recombinant enzymes were inhibited by putrescine, but the K(i) value for the rPfHinge-ODC was 50.4 microM (IC(50)=157 microM), whereas the IC(50) for the rPfODC was 500 microM. Spermidine was a weak inhibitor in both cases. alpha-Difluoromethylornithine inhibited the rPfHinge-ODC with a K(i) value of 87.6 microM. For two novel ODC inhibitors, CGP52622A and CGP54619A, the K(i) values of the rPfHinge-ODC were in the nanomolar range.

The recent identification of antisense RNA in the transcriptomes of many eukaryotes has generated enormous interest. The presence of antisense RNA in Plasmodium falciparum, the causative agent of severe malaria, remains controversial. Elucidation of the mechanism of antisense RNA in P. falciparum synthesis is critical in order to demonstrate the origin and function of these transcripts. Therefore, a systematic analysis of antisense and sense RNA synthesis was performed using direct labeling experiments. Nuclear run on experiments with single-stranded DNA probes demonstrated that antisense RNA is synthesized in the nucleus at several genomic loci. Antisense RNA synthesis is sensitive to the potent RNA polymerase II inhibitor alpha-amanitin. Antisense and sense transcription was also detected in nuclei isolated from synchronized parasites, suggesting concurrent synthesis. In summary, our experiments directly demonstrate that antisense RNA synthesis is a common transcriptional phenomenon in P. falciparum, and is catalyzed by RNA polymerase II.

The paper provides evidence that the An. sacharovi females which do not develop mature eggs after blood-sucking on the malaria-infected donor could not be infected by the bird malaria agent P. gallinaceum. The addition of juvemon (an analogue of juvenile hormone) to glucose solution (mosquito carbohydrate diet) before blood meal stimulates the vitellogenesis of the mosquito after blood digestion, as clearly demonstrated on the female with an incomplete portion of the infected blood. This study has demonstrated that the juvemon does not exert a direct effect on mosquito susceptibility to the bird malaria agent, but it increases the number of females with mature eggs, thus promoting the increase in the percentage of the infected specimens and the number of oocysts.

Plasmodium falciparum is the causative agent of malaria, a disease where new drug targets are required due to increasing resistance to current anti-malarials. TMPK (thymidylate kinase) is a good candidate as it is essential for the synthesis of dTTP, a critical precursor of DNA and has been much studied due to its role in prodrug activation and as a drug target. Type I TMPKs, such as the human enzyme, phosphorylate the substrate AZT (3'-azido-3'-deoxythymidine)-MP (monophosphate) inefficiently compared with type II TMPKs (e.g. Escherichia coli TMPK). In the present paper we report that eukaryotic PfTMPK (P. falciparum TMPK) presents sequence features of a type I enzyme yet the kinetic parameters for AZT-MP phosphorylation are similar to those of the highly efficient E. coli enzyme. Structural information shows that this is explained by a different juxtaposition of the P-loop and the azide of AZT-MP. Subsequent formation of the transition state requires no further movement of the PfTMPK P-loop, with no steric conflicts for the azide moiety, allowing efficient phosphate transfer. Likewise, we present results that confirm the ability of the enzyme to uniquely accept dGMP as a substrate and shed light on the basis for its wider substrate specificity. Information resulting from two ternary complexes (dTMP-ADP and AZT-MP-ADP) and a binary complex with the transition state analogue AP5dT [P1-(5'-adenosyl)-P5-(5'-thymidyl) pentaphosphate] all reveal significant differences with the human enzyme, notably in the lid region and in the P-loop which may be exploited in the rational design of Plasmodium-specific TMPK inhibitors with therapeutic potential.

The use of glutathione reductase inhibitors in chemotherapy is the raison d'être for this study. Two enzymes were purified to homogeneity from the intraerythrocytic malarial parasite Plasmodium falciparum: glutathione disulfide reductase, an antioxidative enzyme, which appears to play an essential role for parasite growth and differentiation, and glutamate dehydrogenase, an enzyme not occurring in the host erythrocyte. The two proteins were copurified and separated by gel electrophoresis with yields of approximately 20%. Malarial glutathione reductase, a homodimer of 110 kDa with a pH optimum of 6.8 and a high preference for NADPH over NADH, was shown to contain FAD as its prosthetic group. The N-terminal sequence, VYDLIVIGGGSGGMA, which can be aligned with residues 20-34 of human glutathione reductase, represents the first beta strand and the diphosphate-fixing helix of the FAD domain. Glutamate dehydrogenase was confirmed as a hexamer with blocked N-termini; it is an enzyme that is highly specific for NADP and NADPH. The copurification of the proteins and the potential of P.falciparum glutathione reductase as a drug target are discussed.

Malaria kills more than one million people a year, and understanding the historical association between its most notorious causative agent, Plasmodium falciparum, and its mosquito vectors is important in fighting the disease. We present a phylogenetic analysis of a number of species within the mosquito subgenus Cellia based on a selection of mitochondrial and nuclear genes. Although some of these relationships have been estimated in other studies, generally few species were included and/or statistical support at many nodes was low. Here we include two additional species of anthropophilic P. falciparum malaria vectors and reanalyze these relationships using a Bayesian method that allows us to simultaneously incorporate different models of evolution. We report data that indicate a paraphyletic relationship between five anthropophilic African mosquito vectors. Such a relationship suggests that these species can serve as independent natural experiments for anopheline immunologic responses to regular, prolonged contact with P. falciparum.

Ferroquine (FQ or SR97193) is a unique ferrocene antimalarial drug candidate which just entered phase IIb clinical trials in autumn 2007. FQ is able to overcome the chloroquine (CQ) resistance problem, an important limit to the control of Plasmodium falciparum, the principal causative agent of malaria. However, as for other therapeutic agents such as chloroquine (CQ) and artemisin, its mechanism of action remains partially unknown. Most investigations have so far focused on comparing the activity of FQ to that of CQ in order to understand how the ferrocene core contributes to a stronger antiplasmodial activity. Studies have already shown that the ferrocene altered the shape, volume, lipophilicity, basicity and also electronic profile of the parent molecule and, hence, its pharmacodynamic behavior. However, few investigations have been undertaken to probe the real contribution of redox properties of the ferrocene (iron(II))/ferricinium (iron(III)) system in FQ as reported in this article. In our experimental and theoretical approach, we considered the redox profile of the ferrocene core of FQ in the specific conditions (acidic and oxidizing) of the parasitic digestive vacuole as a possible discriminating property from CQ in the antimalarial activity.

Mitochondrial (mt) genomes from diverse phylogenetic groups vary considerably in size, structure and organization. The genus Plasmodium, the causative agent of malaria, has the smallest mt genome in the form of a tandemly repeated, linear element of 6 kb. The Plasmodium mt genome encodes only three protein genes (cox1, cox3 and cob) and large- and small-subunit ribosomal RNA (rRNA) genes, which are highly fragmented with 19 identified rRNA pieces. The complete mt genome sequences of 21 Plasmodium species have been published but a thorough investigation of the arrangement of rRNA gene fragments has been undertaken for only Plasmodium falciparum, the human malaria parasite. In this study, we determined the arrangement of mt rRNA gene fragments in 23 Plasmodium species, including two newly determined mt genome sequences from P. gallinaceum and P. vinckei vinckei, as well as Leucocytozoon caulleryi, an outgroup of Plasmodium. Comparative analysis reveals complete conservation of the arrangement of rRNA gene fragments in the mt genomes of all the 23 Plasmodium species and L. caulleryi. Surveys for a new rRNA gene fragment using hidden Markov models enriched with recent mt genome sequences led us to suggest the mtR-26 sequence as a novel candidate LSU rRNA fragment in the mt genomes of the 24 species. Additionally, we found 22-25 bp-inverted repeat sequences, which may be involved in the generation of lineage-specific mt genome arrangements after divergence from a common ancestor of the genera Eimeria and Plasmodium/Leucocytozoon.

To date, only a few transcription factors have been identified in the genome of the parasite Plasmodium falciparum, the causative agent of malaria. Moreover, no detailed molecular analysis of its basal transcription machinery, which is otherwise well-conserved in the crown group of eukaryotes, has yet been reported. In this study, we have used a combination of sensitive sequence analysis methods to predict the existence of several parasite encoded general transcription factors associated with RNA polymerase II. Several orthologs of general transcription factors associated with RNA polymerase II can be predicted among the hypothetical proteins of the P. falciparum genome using the two-dimensional Hydrophobic Cluster Analysis (HCA) together with profile-based search methods (PSI-BLAST). These predicted orthologous genes encoding putative transcription factors include the large subunit of TFIIA and two candidates for its small subunit, the TFIIE beta-subunit, which would associate with the previously known TFIIE alpha-subunit, the TFIIF beta-subunit, as well as the p62/TFB1 subunit of the TFIIH core. Within TFIID, the putative orthologs of TAF1, TAF2, TAF7 and TAF10 were also predicted. However, no candidates for TAFs with classical histone fold domain (HFD) were found, suggesting an unusual architecture of TFIID complex of RNA polymerase II in the parasite. Taken together, these results suggest that more general transcription factors may be present in the P. falciparum proteome than initially thought. The prediction of these orthologous general transcription factors opens the way for further studies dealing with transcriptional regulation in P. falciparum. These alternative and sensitive sequence analysis methods can help to identify candidates for other transcriptional regulatory factors in P. falciparum. They will also facilitate the prediction of biological functions for several orphan proteins from other apicomplexan parasites such as Toxoplasma gondii, Cryptosporidium parvum and Eimeria.

Malaria is a widespread and infectious disease that is a leading cause of death in many parts of the world. Eradication of malaria has been a major world health goal for decades, but one that still remains elusive. Other diseases have been eradicated using vaccination, but traditional vaccination methods have thus far been unsuccessful for malaria. Infection by Plasmodium species, the causative agent of malaria, is currently treated with drug-based therapies, but an increase in drug resistance has led to the need for new methods of treatment. A promising strategy for malaria treatment is to combine transmission blocking vaccines (TBVs) that prevent spread of disease with drug-based therapies to treat infected individuals. TBVs can be developed against surface protein antigens that are expressed during parasite reproduction in the mosquito. When the mosquito ingests blood from a vaccinated individual harboring the Plasmodium parasite, the antibodies generated by vaccination prevent completion of the parasites life-cycle. Animal studies have shown that immunization with Pfs48/45 results in the production of malaria transmission blocking antibodies; however, the development of this vaccine candidate has been hindered by poor expression in both prokaryotic and eukaryotic hosts. Recently, the chloroplast of Chlamydomonas reinhardtii has been used to express complex recombinant proteins. In this study, we show that the C-terminal antigenic region of the Pfs48/45 antigen can be expressed in the chloroplast of the green algae C. reinhardtii and that this recombinant protein has a conformation recognized by known transmission blocking antibodies. Production of this protein in algae has the potential to scale to the very large volumes required to meet the needs of millions at risk for contracting malaria.

To demonstrate malaria situation analysis, stratification and planning for an endemic area in southern Iran. Data on health system, population, meteorological parameters, malaria cases, anopheline vectors, and control activities during 2005-2007 was obtained from Minab Health Center, Minab Meteorological Station and published documents about malaria elements in the study area. A datasheet was created in excel 2003 for analysis. There were 644 health staff working in Minab District including 99 health staff in malaria control program. The health facilities are distributed as follow: 1 hospital with 96 beds, 23 health centers including private centers (10 in Minab city and 13 in rural area of Minab District) and 119 health houses in rural areas of Minab District. A nopheles stephensi was the dominant species in Minab District, however, Anopheles dthali, Anopheles superpictus, Anopheles fluviatilis, Anopheles multicolor, Anopheles pulcherrimus and Anopheles turkhudi can also be found in the area. Anopheles stephensi was reported susceptible to malathion, propoxur, primphos-methyl, lambda-cyhalothrin permethrin and deltamethrin, and resistant to DDT and dieldrin in the area. During the study period a total of 10 665 positive cases were reported, mainly due to local transmission (99.6%). Plasmodium vivax was the main causative agent followed by Plasmodium falciparum. There were reports about drug resistance of Plasmodium falciparum in the area. Using different parameters, Minab was classified into 3 strata. A plan was designed based on described goal, objectives and targets. The approaches of this plan were categorized into: health education, early detection and correct treatment, and vector control. Main constraints of these approaches are population movement between Iran, Pakistan and Afghanistan; vector control challenges at district, inadequate skilled medical staff in malaria case management and weak inter-sectorial coordination for malaria control, especially in urban areas.

Plasmodium falciparum is the major causative agent of malaria, a disease of worldwide importance. Resistance to current drugs such as chloroquine and mefloquine is spreading at an alarming rate, and our antimalarial armamentarium is almost depleted. The malarial parasite encodes two homologous aspartic proteases, plasmepsins I and II, which are essential components of its hemoglobin-degradation pathway and are novel targets for antimalarial drug development. We have determined the crystal structure of recombinant plasmepsin II complexed with pepstatin A. This represents the first reported crystal structure of a protein from P. falciparum. The crystals contain molecules in two different conformations, revealing a remarkable degree of interdomain flexibility of the enzyme. The structure was used to design a series of selective low molecular weight compounds that inhibit both plasmepsin II and the growth of P. falciparum in culture.

Vaccines that interrupt malaria transmission are of increasing interest and a robust functional assay to measure this activity would promote their development by providing a biologically relevant means of evaluating potential vaccine candidates. Therefore, we aimed to qualify the standard membrane-feeding assay (SMFA). The assay measures the transmission-blocking activity of antibodies by feeding cultured P. falciparum gametocytes to Anopheles mosquitoes in the presence of the test antibodies and measuring subsequent mosquito infection. The International Conference on Harmonisation (ICH) Harmonised Tripartite Guideline Q2(R1) details characteristics considered in assay validation. Of these characteristics, we decided to qualify the SMFA for Precision, Linearity, Range and Specificity. The transmission-blocking 4B7 monoclonal antibody was tested over 6 feeding experiments at several concentrations to determine four suitable concentrations that were tested in triplicate in the qualification experiments (3 additional feeds) to evaluate Precision, Linearity and Range. For Specificity, 4B7 was tested in the presence of normal mouse IgG. We determined intra- and inter-assay variability of % inhibition of mean oocyst intensity at each concentration of 4B7 (lower concentrations showed higher variability). We also showed that % inhibition was dependent on 4B7 concentration and the activity is specific to 4B7. Since obtaining empirical data is time-consuming, we generated a model using data from all 9 feeds and simulated the effects of different parameters on final readouts to improve the assay procedure and analytical methods for future studies. For example, we estimated the effect of number of mosquitoes dissected on variability of % inhibition, and simulated the relationship between % inhibition in oocyst intensity and % inhibition of prevalence of infected mosquitos at different mean oocysts in the control. SMFA is one of the few biological assays used in preclinical and early clinical development of transmission-blocking vaccines, and this study strongly supports its further development and application.

Plasmodium falciparum is the causative agent of malaria, a disease that kills almost one million persons each year, mainly in sub-Saharan Africa. P. falciparum is transmitted to the human host by the bite of an Anopheles female mosquito, and Anopheles gambiae sensus stricto is the most tremendous malaria vector in Africa, widespread throughout the afro-tropical belt. An. gambiae s.s. is subdivided into two distinct molecular forms, namely M and S forms. The two molecular forms are morphologically identical but they are distinct genetically, and differ by their distribution and their ecological preferences. The epidemiological importance of the two molecular forms in malaria transmission has been poorly investigated so far and gave distinct results in different areas. We have developed a real-time quantitative PCR (qPCR) assay, and used it to detect P. falciparum at the oocyst stage in wild An. gambiae s.s. mosquitoes experimentally infected with natural isolates of parasites. Mosquitoes were collected at immature stages in sympatric and allopatric breeding sites and further infected at the adult stage. We next measured the infection prevalence and intensity in female mosquitoes using the qPCR assay and correlated the infection success with the mosquito molecular forms. Our results revealed different prevalence of infection between the M and S molecular forms of An. gambiae s.s. in Cameroon, for both sympatric and allopatric populations of mosquitoes. However, no difference in the infection intensity was observed. Thus, the distribution of the molecular forms of An. gambiae s.s. may impact on the malaria epidemiology, and it will be important to monitor the efficiency of malaria control interventions on the two M and S forms.

Malaria is a global health emergency, and yet our understanding of the energy metabolism of the principle causative agent of this devastating disease, Plasmodium falciparum, remains rather basic. Glucose was shown to be an essential nutritional requirement nearly 100 years ago and since this original observation, much of the current knowledge of Plasmodium energy metabolism is based on early biochemical work, performed using basic analytical techniques (e.g. paper chromatography), carried out almost exclusively on avian and rodent malaria. Data derived from malaria parasite genome and transcriptome studies suggest that the energy metabolism of the parasite may be more complex than hitherto anticipated. This study was undertaken in order to further characterize the fate of glucose catabolism in the human malaria parasite, P. falciparum. Products of glucose catabolism were determined by incubating erythrocyte-freed parasites with D-[1-13C] glucose under controlled conditions and metabolites were identified using 13C-NMR spectroscopy. Following a 2 h incubation of freed-P. falciparum parasites with 25 mM D-[1-13C] glucose (n = 4), the major metabolites identified included; [3-13C] lactate, [1,3-13C] glycerol, [3-13C] pyruvate, [3-13C] alanine and [3-13C] glycerol-3-phosphate. Control experiments performed with uninfected erythrocytes incubated under identical conditions did not show any metabolism of D-[1-13C] glucose to glycerol or glycerol-3-phosphate. The identification of glycerol as a major glucose metabolite confirms the view that energy metabolism in this parasite is more complex than previously proposed. It is hypothesized here that glycerol production by the malaria parasite is the result of a metabolic adaptation to growth in O2-limited (and CO2 elevated) conditions by the operation of a glycerol-3-phosphate shuttle for the re-oxidation of assimilatory NADH. Similar metabolic adaptations have been reported previously for other microaerobic/anaerobic organisms, such as yeast, rumen protozoa and human parasitic protozoa. These data highlight the need to re-evaluate the carbon and redox balance of this important human pathogen, ultimately leading to a better understanding of how the parasite is able to adapt to the variable environments encountered during parasite development and disease progression.

Although malaria has become a serious public health problem in Mauritania since the late 1990s, few documented data on its epidemiology exist. The objective of this study was to assess the morbidity of clinical malaria among children in Nouakchott. Three hundred and one febrile children, consulting at three health facilities of Nouakchott, were screened for malaria in 2009 (n=216) and 2010 (n=85). Plasmodium species identification and parasite density were determined by microscopic examination of Giemsa-stained thin and thick films and confirmed by rapid diagnostic test and nested PCR. Of 301 febrile children, 105 (34.9%) were malaria-positive by nested PCR and 87 (28.9%) by microscopy. Plasmodium vivax represented 97.1% (102/105) and P. falciparum accounted for 2.9% (3/105) of positive cases. All positive children under five years old were infected with P. vivax. The highest numbers of malaria positives were found during or shortly after the rainy season and the lowest during the dry season. Fifty-four of 105 (51.4%) malaria cases, all with P. vivax, had never travelled outside Nouakchott. Individuals belonging to the Moors ethnic group represented 97.0% of P. vivax cases. Results of the present study indicate that malaria is endemic in Nouakchott and that P. vivax is the principal causative agent. Regular surveillance is required to monitor malaria prevalence and incidence, and further measures are needed to counter the possible spread of malaria in the country.

A laboratory model of circulation of the malaria causative agent P. gallinaceum has been used to show that the effect of precocene (antijuvenoid) leads to a statistically significant reduction in the proportion of infected females developing eggs after blood suction. The females failing to develop eggs are not infected. Trichopol (antiexdisone) inhibits vitellogenesis The females undeveloping eggs become susceptible to the causative agent though to a lesser degree than those developing them. The findings suggest that there is an association of the mosquito susceptibility to the malaria causative agent with the balance of hormones in the body of disease the carrier.

A model betalainic dye was semisynthesized from betanin, the magenta pigment of the red beet, and was effective for live-cell imaging of Plasmodium-infected red blood cells. This water-soluble fluorescent probe is photostable, excitable in the visible region and cell membrane-permeable, and its photophysical properties are not notably pH-sensitive. Fluorescence imaging microscopy of erythrocytes infected with Plasmodium falciparum, a causative agent of malaria in humans, showed that only the parasite was stained. Z-stacking analysis suggested that the probe accumulates proximal to the nucleus of the parasite. Indicaxanthin, one of the natural fluorescent betalains found in the petals of certain flowers, did not stain the parasite or the red blood cell.

Recent reports highlight the severity and the morbidity of disease caused by the long neglected malaria parasite Plasmodium vivax. Due to inherent difficulties in the laboratory-propagation of P. vivax, the biology of this parasite has not been adequately explored. While the proteome of P. falciparum, the causative agent of cerebral malaria, has been extensively explored from several sources, there is limited information on the proteome of P. vivax. We have, for the first time, examined the proteome of P. vivax isolated directly from patients without adaptation to laboratory conditions. We have identified 153 proteins from clinical P. vivax, majority of which do not show homology to any previously known gene products. We also report 29 new proteins that were found to be expressed in P. vivax for the first time. In addition, several proteins previously implicated as anti-malarial targets, were also found in our analysis. Most importantly, we found several unique proteins expressed by P. vivax.This study is an important step in providing insight into physiology of the parasite under clinical settings.

The Plasmodium falciparum malaria parasite is the causative agent of malaria tropica. Merozoites, one of the extracellular developmental stages of this parasite, expose at their surface the merozoite surface protein-1 complex (MSP-1), which results from the proteolytic processing of a 190-200 kDa precursor. MSP-1 is highly immunogenic in humans and numerous studies suggest that this protein is an effective target for a protective immune response. Although its function is unknown, there are indications that it may play a role during invasion of erythrocytes by merozoites. The parasite-derived msp-1 gene, which is approximately 5000 bp long, contains 74% AT. This high AT content has prevented stable cloning of the full-size gene in Escherichia coli and consequently its expression in heterologous systems. Here, we describe the synthesis of a 4917 bp gene encoding MSP-1 from the FCB-1 strain of P. falciparum adjusted for human codon preferences. The synthetic msp-1 gene (55% AT) was cloned, maintained and expressed in its entirety in E.coli as well as in CHO and HeLa cells. The purified protein is soluble and appears to possess native conformation because it reacts with a panel of mAbs specific for conformational epitopes. The strategy we used for synthesizing the full-length msp-1 gene was toassemble it from DNA fragments encoding all of the major proteolytic fragments normally generated at the parasite's surface. Thus, after subcloning we also obtained each of these MSP-1 processing products as hexahistidine fusion proteins in E.coli and isolated them by affinity chromatography on Ni2+agarose. The availability of defined preparations of MSP-1 and its major processing products open up new possibilities for in-depth studies at the structural and functional level of this important protein, including the exploration of MSP-1-based experimental vaccines.

Overcoming antigenic variation is one of the major challenges in the development of an effective vaccine against Plasmodium falciparum, a causative agent of human malaria. Inclusion of multiple Ag variants in subunit vaccine candidates is one strategy that has aimed to overcome this problem for the leading blood-stage malaria vaccine targets, that is, merozoite surface protein 1 (MSP1) and apical membrane Ag 1 (AMA1). However, previous studies, utilizing malaria Ags, have concluded that inclusion of multiple allelic variants, encoding altered peptide ligands, in such a vaccine may be detrimental to both the priming and in vivo restimulation of Ag-experienced T cells. In this study, we analyze the T cell responses to two alleles of MSP1 and AMA1 induced by vaccination of malaria-naive adult volunteers with bivalent viral-vectored vaccine candidates. We show a significant bias to the 3D7/MAD20 allele compared with the Wellcome allele for the 33 kDa region of MSP1, but not for the 19 kDa fragment or the AMA1 Ag. Although this bias could be caused by "immune interference" at priming, the data do not support a significant role for "immune antagonism" during memory T cell restimulation, despite observation of the latter at a minimal epitope level in vitro. A lack of class I HLA epitopes in the Wellcome allele that are recognized by vaccinated volunteers may in fact contribute to the observed bias. We also show that controlled infection with 3D7 strain P. falciparum parasites neither boosts existing 3D7-specific T cell responses nor appears to "immune divert" cellular responses toward the Wellcome allele.

Comparative genomic analysis of the malaria causative agent, Plasmodium falciparum, with other eukaryotes for which the complete genome is available, revealed that the genome from P. falciparum was more similar to the genome of a plant, Arabidopsis thaliana, than to other non-apicomplexan taxa. Plant-like sequences are thought to result from horizontal gene transfers after a secondary endosymbiosis involving an algal ancestor. The use of the A. thaliana genome and proteome as a reference gives an opportunity to refine our understanding of the extreme compositional bias in the P. falciparum genome that leads to a proteome-wide amino acid bias. A set of pairs of non-redundant protein homologues was selected owing to rigorous genome-wide sequence comparison methods. The introduction of A. thaliana as a reference was a mean to weight the magnitude of the protein evolutionary divergence in P. falciparum. The correlation of the amino acid proportions with evolutionary time supports the hypothesis that amino acids encoded by GC-rich codons are directionally substituted into amino acids encoded by AT-rich codons in the P. falciparum proteome. The long-term deviation of codons in malarial sequences appears as a possible consequence of a genome-wide tri-nucleotidic signature imprinting. Additionally, this study suggests possible working guidelines to improve the accuracy of P. falciparum sequence comparisons, for homology searches and phylogenetic studies.

High resolution 31P-NMR has been used for the non-invasive observation of metabolites and metabolic rates in blood of normal mice and of mice infected with Plasmodium berghei, the causative agent of malaria. 31P-NMR was used to quantitate levels of 2,3-diphosphoglycerate in whole cells as a function of the degree of parasitemia and yielded good agreement with the results of enzymatic assays. The time-dependence of 31P metabolites was monitored in both normal and infected erythrocytes, greater rates of decay of 2,3-diphosphoglycerate being observed in malarial blood which correlate with the level of parasitemia. Very high metabolic rates of infected cells render measurement of intracellular pH unreliable on freshly drawn whole blood. When appropriate measures are taken to avoid this complication, no difference is observed in the intracellular pH of parasitized and non-parasitized erythrocytes from infected animals. In both normal and parasitized mice the intraerythrocytic pH is more acidic than that of the suspending medium by 0.15 pH unit at 25 degrees C. Unlike free-living protozoa, the parasitic protozoan Plasmodium does not contain detectable levels of phosphonates or polyphosphates, in either whole cells or perchloric acid extracts thereof.

In aerobic respiration, the tricarboxylic acid cycle is pivotal to the complete oxidation of carbohydrates, proteins, and lipids to carbon dioxide and water. Plasmodium falciparum, the causative agent of human malaria, lacks a conventional tricarboxylic acid cycle and depends exclusively on glycolysis for ATP production. However, all of the constituent enzymes of the tricarboxylic acid cycle are annotated in the genome of P. falciparum, which implies that the pathway might have important, yet unidentified biosynthetic functions. Here we show that fumarate, a side product of the purine salvage pathway and a metabolic intermediate of the tricarboxylic acid cycle, is not a metabolic waste but is converted to aspartate through malate and oxaloacetate. P. falciparum-infected erythrocytes and free parasites incorporated [2,3-(14)C]fumarate into the nucleic acid and protein fractions. (13)C NMR of parasites incubated with [2,3-(13)C]fumarate showed the formation of malate, pyruvate, lactate, and aspartate but not citrate or succinate. Further, treatment of free parasites with atovaquone inhibited the conversion of fumarate to aspartate, thereby indicating this pathway as an electron transport chain-dependent process. This study, therefore, provides a biosynthetic function for fumarate hydratase, malate quinone oxidoreductase, and aspartate aminotransferase of P. falciparum.

Several species of Plasmodium have been shown to contain a circular extrachromosomal DNA molecule which is widely supposed to be mitochondrial DNA. However, it has recently been shown to have a number of features in common with chloroplast DNA. Here, a phylogenetic analysis of RNA polymerase coding sequences from the Plasmodium molecule has been carried out using distance matrix, maximum likelihood, parsimony and operator invariant methods. The analysis indicates that the molecule is in fact derived from an oxygenic photosynthetic organism and should be regarded as plastid DNA. This suggests that Plasmodium originated from a phototroph that has lost the capacity to photosynthesize.
