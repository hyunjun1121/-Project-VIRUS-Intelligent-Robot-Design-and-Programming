Which is the primary protein component of Lewy bodies?

Parkinson's disease (PD) is the second most common neurodegenerative disorder, defined by the presence of resting tremor, muscular rigidity, bradykinesia, and postural instability. PD is characterized by the progressive loss of dopaminergic neurons within the substantia nigra pars compacta of the midbrain. The neuropathological hallmark of the disease is the presence of intracytoplasmic inclusions, called Lewy bodies (LBs) and Lewy neurites (LNs), containing α-synuclein, a small protein which is widely expressed in the brain. The α-synuclein gene, SNCA, is located on chromosome 4q22.1; SNCA-linked PD shows an autosomal dominant inheritance pattern with a relatively early onset age, and it usually progresses rapidly. Three missense mutations, A53T, A30P, and E46K, in addition to gene multiplications of the SNCA have been described so far. Although it is clear that LBs and LNs contain mainly the α-synuclein protein, the mechanism(s) which leads α-synuclein to accumulate needs to be elucidated. The primary question in the molecular pathology of PD is how wild-type α-synuclein aggregates in PD, and which interacting partner(s) plays role(s) in the aggregation process. It is known that dopamine synthesis is a stressfull event, and α-synuclein expression somehow affects the dopamine synthesis. The aberrant interactions of α-synuclein with the proteins in the dopamine synthesis pathway may cause disturbances in cellular mechanisms. The normal physiological folding state of α-synuclein is also important for the understanding of pathological aggregates. Recent studies on the α-synuclein protein and genome-wide association studies of the α-synuclein gene show that PD has a strong genetic component, and both familial and idiopathic PD have a common denominator, α-synuclein, at the molecular level. It is clear that the disease process in Parkinson's disease, as in other neurodegenerative disorders, is very complicated; there can be several different molecular pathways which are responsible for diverse and possibly also unrelated functions inside the neuron, playing roles in PD pathogenesis.

Mutations in the alpha-synuclein gene have been linked to rare cases of familial Parkinson's disease (PD). Alpha-synuclein is a major component of Lewy bodies (LB), a pathological hallmark of PD. Transgenic mice and Drosophila expressing either wild-type or mutant human alpha-synuclein develop motor deficits, LB-like inclusions in some neurons, and neuronal degeneration. However, the relationship between abnormal aggregates of alpha-synuclein and human dopamine (DA) neuron degeneration remains unclear. In this report, we have investigated the influence of alpha-synuclein expression on DA neurons in primary culture of embryonic human mesencephalon. Two days after culture, human DA cells were transduced with wild-type or mutant human (Ala(53)Thr) alpha-synuclein adenoviruses and maintained for 5 days. Overexpression of mutant and wild-type human alpha-synuclein resulted in 49% (P<0.01) and 27% (P<0.05) loss of DA neurons, respectively, while not affecting viability of other cells in the culture. Overexpression of rat alpha-synuclein or GFP (green fluorescent protein) had no effect on DA neuron survival. Cytoplasmic inclusions of alpha-synuclein were detected immunohistochemically in DA cells transduced with mutant human alpha-synuclein, but not wild-type alpha-synuclein. These results show that overexpression of human alpha-synuclein, particularly the mutant form, can cause human DA neuron death, suggesting that alpha-synuclein may have a primary role in the pathogenesis of PD.

Two missense mutations (Ala-30 --> Pro and Ala-53 --> Thr) in the gene encoding alpha-synuclein are associated with rare autosomal dominant forms of familial Parkinson's disease. In addition, alpha-synuclein is an abundant component of Lewy bodies in sporadic Parkinson's disease and diffuse Lewy body disease. However, the normal conformation of alpha-synuclein, its cellular localization in neurons, and the effects of the mutations remain to be determined. In the present study, we examine these questions using sensitive fluorescence resonance energy transfer techniques. Transient transfection of alpha-synuclein expression constructs into primary cortical neurons and counterstaining with the lipophilic fluorescent marker, DiI, demonstrates a close association between alpha-synuclein and cellular membranes. Both the N- and C-terminal regions of alpha-synuclein are tightly associated with membranes. A weak interaction also occurs between the N and C termini themselves. The Parkinson's disease-associated mutations have no effect on membrane interaction; however, the Ala-30 --> Pro mutation alters the three-dimensional conformation of alpha-synuclein, as measured by significantly increased fluorescence resonance energy transfer between the N and C termini.

Transactivation response DNA-binding protein 43 (TDP-43) proteinopathies are classified based upon the extent of modified TDP-43 and include a growing number of neurodegenerative diseases such as amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, frontotemporal lobar degeneration with ubiquitin-immunoreactive, tau-negative inclusions and frontotemporal lobar degeneration with motor neuron disease. The purpose of the study was to examine whether proteolytic modifications of TDP-43 are a relevant finding in Parkinson's disease (PD) and dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB). A novel site-directed caspase cleavage antibody, termed TDP caspase cleavage product antibody (TDPccp), was utilized based upon a known caspase 3 cleavage consensus site within TDP-43 at position 219. Application of this antibody to postmortem brain sections from PD and DLB patients revealed the presence of caspase-cleaved TDP-43 in Lewy bodies and Hirano bodies in all cases examined. Colocalization of TDPccp with an antibody to alpha-synuclein (alpha-Syn), which served as a general marker for Lewy bodies, was evident within the substantia nigra in both alpha-synucleinopathies. Interestingly, the TDPccp antibody detected a greater number of Lewy bodies in PD and DLB compared to the alpha-Syn antibody. In addition, a semiquantitative analysis in both diseases confirmed this finding by indicating that the percentage of caspase-cleaved TDP-43 single-labeled Lewy bodies was approximately twice that of alpha-Syn labeling (in DLB 13.4 vs. 5.5%, while in PD 34.6 vs. 17.6%). Collectively, these data have identified caspase-cleaved TDP-43 as a primary component of Lewy and Hirano bodies in PD and DLB, and suggest that the TDPccp antibody is an effective marker for the detection of Lewy bodies in these neurodegenerative diseases.

ATP13A2 (PARK9) loss of function mutations are a genetic cause of an early-onset form of Parkinson's disease (PD), with in vitro studies showing that ATP13A2 deficits lead to lysosomal and mitochondrial dysfunction and α-synuclein accumulation, while elevated ATP13A2 expression reduces α-synuclein toxicity. The three human brain tissue studies assessing changes in ATP13A2 expression in PD produced divergent results; mRNA is increased while protein levels were observed to be either increased or decreased. This apparent conflict in protein levels might have arisen from examining Lewy body disease cases with coexisting Alzheimer-type pathologies.To assess whether ATP13A2 levels in Lewy body disease are modified by Alzheimer-type β-amyloid deposition, we evaluated cases of pure PD and pure dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB) for changes in ATP13A2, α-synuclein and β-amyloid protein levels in cortical regions with and without Lewy bodies. In all Lewy body disease cases, we identified decreased ATP13A2 protein levels that correlated with increases in both α-synuclein and β-amyloid. Partial colocalization was observed between ATP13A2 and α-synuclein in Lewy bodies, whereas ATP13A2 did not colocalize with pathological β-amyloid deposition. Our data show that patients with Lewy body diseases have an overall deficit in ATP13A2 protein levels, with the remaining protein being more insoluble and partially redistributing towards Lewy bodies. This supports the concept that increasing ATP13A2 levels may offer potential therapeutic benefits to patients with Lewy body diseases.

The natively disordered protein alpha-synuclein is the primary component of Lewy bodies, the cellular hallmark of Parkinson's disease. Most studies of this protein are performed in dilute solution, but its biologically relevant role is performed in the crowded environment inside cells. We addressed the effects of macromolecular crowding on alpha-synuclein by combining NMR data acquired in living Escherichia coli with in vitro NMR data. The crowded environment in the E.coli periplasm prevents a conformational change that is detected at 35 degrees C in dilute solution. This change is associated with an increase in hydrodynamic radius and the formation of secondary structure in the N-terminal 100 amino acid residues. By preventing this temperature-induced conformational change, crowding in the E.coli periplasm stabilizes the disordered monomer. We obtain the same stabilization in vitro upon crowding alpha-synuclein with 300 g/l of bovine serum albumin, indicating that crowding alone is sufficient to stabilize the disordered, monomeric protein. Two disease-associated variants (A30P and A53T) behave in the same way in both dilute solution and in the E.coli periplasm. These data reveal the importance of approaching the effects of macromolecular crowding on a case-by-case basis. Additionally, our work shows that discrete structured protein conformations may not be achieved by alpha-synuclein inside cells, implicating the commonly overlooked aspect of macromolecular crowding as a possible factor in the etiology of Parkinson's disease.

Common cellular and molecular mechanisms including protein aggregation and inclusion body formation are involved in many neurodegenerative diseases. α-Synuclein is a major component of Lewy bodies in Parkinson's disease (PD) as well as in glial cytoplasmic inclusions in multiple system atrophy (MSA). Tau is a principal component of neurofibrillary and glial tangles in tauopathies. Recently, TDP-43 was identified as a component of ubiquitinated inclusions in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis and frontotemporal lobar degeneration. PD is traditionally considered a movement disorder with hallmark lesions in the brainstem pigmented nuclei. However, pathological changes occur in widespread regions of the central and peripheral nervous systems in this disease. Furthermore, primary glial involvement ("gliodegeneration") can be observed in PD and MSA as well as in tauopathy. The present article reviews abnormal protein accumulation and inclusion body formation inside and outside the central nervous system.

Lewy bodies and coarse Lewy neurites are the pathological hallmarks of degenerating neurons in the brains of patients suffering from Parkinson's disease (PD). Recently, the presynaptic protein alpha-synuclein was shown to be a major component of Lewy bodies and Lewy neurites. This study demonstrates for the first time that extensive and thin alpha-synuclein-immunoreactive inclusions are present in the axonal processes of neurons.

Many neurodegenerative diseases are associated with the aggregation of misfolded proteins into amyloid oligomers or fibrils that are deposited as pathological lesions within areas of the brain. An attractive therapeutic strategy for preventing or ameliorating amyloid formation is to identify agents that inhibit the onset or propagation of protein aggregation. Here we demonstrate how solid-state nuclear magnetic resonance (ssNMR) may be used to identify key residues within amyloidogenic protein sequences that may be targeted to inhibit the aggregation of the host protein. For alpha-synuclein, the major protein component of Lewy bodies associated with Parkinson's disease, we have used a combination of ssNMR and biochemical data to identify the key region for self-aggregation of the protein as residues 77-82 (VAQKTV). We used our new structural information to design a peptide derived from residues 77 to 82 of alpha-synuclein with an N-methyl group at the C-terminal residue, which was able to disrupt the aggregation of alpha-synuclein. Thus, we have shown how structural data obtained from ssNMR can guide the design of modified peptides for use as amyloid inhibitors, as a primary step toward developing therapeutic compounds for prevention and/or treatment of amyloid diseases.

Fibrillar α-synuclein (α-Syn) is the principal component of Lewy bodies, which are evident in individuals affected by Parkinson disease (PD). This neuropathologic form of α-Syn plays a central role in PD progression as it has been shown to propagate between neurons. Tools that interfere with α-Syn assembly or change the physicochemical properties of the fibrils have potential therapeutic properties as they may be sufficient to interfere with and/or halt cell-to-cell transmission and the systematic spread of α-Syn assemblies within the central nervous system. Vertebrate molecular chaperones from the constitutive/heat-inducible heat shock protein 70 (Hsc/p70) family have been shown to hinder the assembly of soluble α-Syn into fibrils and to bind to the fibrils and very significantly reduce their toxicity. To understand how Hsc70 family members sequester soluble α-Syn, we set up experiments to identify the molecular chaperone-α-Syn surface interfaces. We cross-linked human Hsc70 and its yeast homologue Ssa1p and α-Syn using a chemical cross-linker and mapped the Hsc70- and Ssa1p-α-Syn interface. We show that the client binding domain of Hsc70 and Ssa1p binds two regions within α-Syn similar to a tweezer, with the first spanning residues 10-45 and the second spanning residues 97-102. Our findings define what is necessary and sufficient for engineering Hsc70- and Ssa1p-derived polypeptide with minichaperone properties with a potential as therapeutic agents in Parkinson disease through their ability to affect α-Syn assembly and/or toxicity.

Aggregation of α-synuclein (αSyn), the primary protein component in Lewy body inclusions of patients with Parkinson's disease, arises when the normally soluble intrinsically disordered protein converts to amyloid fibrils. In this work, we provide a mechanistic view of the role of N-terminal acetylation on fibrillation by first establishing a quantitative relationship between monomer secondary structural propensity and fibril assembly kinetics, and secondly by demonstrating in the N-terminal acetylated form of the early onset A53T mutation, that N-terminal transient helices formed and/or inhibited by N-terminal acetylation modulate the fibril assembly rates. Using NMR chemical shifts and fluorescence experiments, we report that secondary structural propensity in residues 5-8, 14-31, and 50-57 are highly correlated to fibril growth rate. A four-way comparison of secondary structure propensity and fibril growth rates of N-terminally acetylated A53T and WT αSyn with non-acetylated A53T and WT αSyn present novel mechanistic insight into the role of N-terminal acetylation in amyloid fibril formation. We show that N-terminal acetylation inhibits the formation of the "fibrillation promoting" transient helix at residues 14-31 resulting from the A53T mutation in the non-acetylated variant and supports the formation of the "fibrillation inhibiting" transient helix in residues 1-12 thereby resulting in slower fibrillation rates relative to the previously studied non-acetylated A53T variant. Our results highlight the critical interplay of the region-specific transient secondary structure of the N-terminal region with fibrillation, and the inhibitory role of the N-terminal acetyl group in fibril formation.

Neuronal loss in specific brain regions and neurons with intracellular inclusions termed Lewy bodies are the pathologic hallmark in both Parkinson's disease (PD) and dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB). Lewy bodies comprise of aggregated intracellular vesicles and proteins and α-synuclein is reported to be a major protein component. Using human brain tissue from control, PD and DLB and light and confocal immunohistochemistry with antibodies to superoxide dismutase 2 as a marker for mitochondria, α-synuclein for Lewy bodies and βIII Tubulin for microtubules we have examined the relationship between Lewy bodies and mitochondrial loss. We have shown microtubule regression and mitochondrial and nuclear degradation in neurons with developing Lewy bodies. In PD, multiple Lewy bodies were often observed with α-synuclein interacting with DNA to cause marked nuclear degradation. In DLB, the mitochondria are drawn into the Lewy body and the mitochondrial integrity is lost. This work suggests that Lewy bodies are cytotoxic. In DLB, we suggest that microtubule regression and mitochondrial loss results in decreased cellular energy and axonal transport that leads to cell death. In PD, α-synuclein aggregations are associated with intact mitochondria but interacts with and causes nuclear degradation which may be the major cause of cell death.

α-Synuclein is an abundant presynaptic protein and a primary component of Lewy bodies in Parkinson disease. Although its pathogenic role remains unclear, in healthy nerve terminals α-synuclein undergoes a cycle of membrane binding and dissociation. An α-synuclein binding assay was used to screen for vesicle proteins involved in α-synuclein membrane interactions and showed that antibodies directed to the Ras-related GTPase Rab3a and its chaperone RabGDI abrogated α-synuclein membrane binding. Biochemical analyses, including density gradient sedimentation and co-immunoprecipitation, suggested that α-synuclein interacts with membrane-associated GTP-bound Rab3a but not to cytosolic GDP-Rab3a. Accumulation of membrane-bound α-synuclein was induced by the expression of a GTPase-deficient Rab3a mutant, by a dominant-negative GDP dissociation inhibitor mutant unable to recycle Rab3a off membranes, and by Hsp90 inhibitors, radicicol and geldanamycin, which are known to inhibit Rab3a dissociation from membranes. Thus, all treatments that inhibited Rab3a recycling also increased α-synuclein sequestration on intracellular membranes. Our results suggest that membrane-bound GTP-Rab3a stabilizes α-synuclein on synaptic vesicles and that the GDP dissociation inhibitor·Hsp90 complex that controls Rab3a membrane dissociation also regulates α-synuclein dissociation during synaptic activity.

Using post-embedding immunogold electron microscopy, TAR DNA-binding protein of 43 kDa (TDP-43) was localized to neuronal cytoplasmic (NCI) and intranuclear (NII) inclusions, as well as unmyelinated neurites, in frontotemporal lobar degeneration with ubiquitinated inclusions (FTLD-U), amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), Alzheimer's (AD), Pick's disease (PiD) and Lewy body disease (LBD). The TDP-43 immunoreactive structures were morphologically heterogeneous. The most common was characterized by bundles of 10-20 nm diameter straight filaments with electron dense granular material within NCI, NII and neurites. This type of pathology was found in FTLD-U, ALS and some cases of AD. Less often, inclusions in neuritic processes of FTLD-U and some cases of AD contained 10-17 nm diameter straight filaments without granular material. A final type of TDP-43 immunoreactivity was labeling of filaments and granular material associated with tau filaments in neurofibrillary tangles of AD and Pick bodies of PiD or alpha-synuclein filaments in Lewy bodies of LBD. The results suggest that TDP-43 is the primary component of the granulofilamentous inclusions in FTLD-U and ALS. Similar inclusions sometimes accompany filamentous aggregates composed of other abnormal proteins in AD, PiD and LBD.

Lewy bodies, neuropathological hallmarks of Parkinson's disease and dementia with Lewy bodies, comprise alpha-synuclein filaments and other less defined proteins. Characterization of Lewy body proteins that interact with alpha-synuclein may provide insight into the mechanism of Lewy body formation. Double immunofluorescence labeling and confocal microscopy revealed approximately 80% of cortical Lewy bodies contained microtubule-associated protein 1B (MAP-1B) that overlapped with alpha-synuclein. Lewy bodies were isolated using an immunomagnetic technique from brain tissue of patients dying with dementia with Lewy bodies. Lewy body proteins were resolved by polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. Immunoblotting confirmed the presence of MAP-1B and alpha-synuclein in purified Lewy bodies. Direct binding studies revealed a high affinity interaction (IC(50) approximately 20 nm) between MAP-1B and alpha-synuclein. The MAP-1B-binding sites were mapped to the last 45 amino acids of the alpha-synuclein C terminus. MAP-1B also bound in vitro assembled alpha-synuclein fibrils. Thus, MAP-1B may be involved in the pathogenesis of Lewy bodies via its interaction with monomeric and fibrillar alpha-synuclein.

Alpha-synuclein accumulates in the brains of sporadic Parkinson's disease patients as a major component of Lewy bodies, and mutations in alpha-synuclein are associated with familial forms of Parkinson's disease. The pathogenic mechanisms that precede and promote the aggregation of alpha-synuclein into Lewy bodies in neurons remain to be determined. Here, we constructed a series of alpha-synuclein-enhanced green fluorescent protein (alpha-synucleinEGFP, SynEGFP) fusion proteins to address whether the Parkinson's disease-associated mutations alter the subcellular distribution of alpha-synuclein, and to use as a tool for experimental manipulations to induce aggregate formation. When transfected into mouse cultured primary neurons, the 49-kDa alpha-synucleinEGFP fusion proteins are partially truncated to a approximately 27-kDa form. This non-fluorescent carboxy-terminally modified fusion protein spontaneously forms inclusions in the neuronal cytoplasm. A marked increase in the accumulation of inclusions is detected following treatment with each of three proteasome inhibitors, n-acetyl-leu-leu-norleucinal, lactacystin and MG132. Interestingly, Ala30Pro alpha-synucleinEGFP does not form the cytoplasmic inclusions that are characteristic of wild-type and Ala53Thr alpha-synucleinEGFP, supporting the idea that the Ala30Pro alpha-synuclein protein conformation differs from wild-type alpha-synuclein. Similar inclusions are formed if alpha-synuclein carboxy-terminus is modified by the addition of a V5/6xHistidine epitope tag. By contrast, overexpression of unmodified alpha-synuclein does not lead to aggregate formation. Furthermore, synphilin-1, an alpha-synuclein interacting protein also found in Lewy bodies, colocalizes with the carboxy-terminally truncated alpha-synuclein fusion protein in discrete cytoplasmic inclusions.Our finding that manipulations of the carboxy-terminus of alpha-synuclein lead to inclusion formation may provide a model for studies of the pathogenic mechanisms of alpha-synuclein aggregation in Lewy bodies.

Human α-synuclein is a small-sized, natively unfolded protein that in fibrillar form is the primary component of Lewy bodies, the pathological hallmark of Parkinson's disease. Experimental evidence suggests that α-synuclein aggregation is the key event that triggers neurotoxicity although additional findings have proposed a protective role of α-synuclein against oxidative stress. One way to address the mechanism of this protective action is to evaluate α-synuclein-mediated protection by delivering this protein inside cells using a chimeric protein fused with the Tat-transduction domain of HIV Tat, named TAT-α-synuclein. A reliable protocol was designed to efficiently express and purify two different forms of human α-synuclein. The synthetic cDNAs encoding for the native α-synuclein and the fusion protein with the transduction domain of Tat protein from HIV were overexpressed in a BL21(DE3) E. coli strain as His-tagged proteins. The recombinant proteins largely localized (≥ 85%) to the periplasmic space. By using a quick purification protocol, based on recovery of periplasmic space content and metal-chelating chromatography, the recombinant α-synuclein protein forms could be purified in a single step to ≥ 95% purity. Both α-synuclein recombinant proteins form fibrils and the TAT-α-synuclein is also cytotoxic in the micromolar concentration range. To further characterize the molecular mechanisms of α-synuclein neurotoxicity both in vitro and in vivo and to evaluate the relevance of extracellular α-synuclein for the pathogenesis and progression of Parkinson's disease, a suitable method to produce different high-quality forms of this pathological protein is required. Our optimized expression and purification procedure offers an easier and faster means of producing different forms (i.e., both the native and the TAT-fusion form) of soluble recombinant α-synuclein than previously described procedures.

Fibrillar α-synuclein (AS) is the major component of Lewy bodies, the pathological hallmark of Parkinson's disease. Mouse AS (mAS) aggregates much faster than human AS (hAS), although mAS differs from hAS at only seven positions in its primary sequence. Currently, little is known about the site-specific structural differences between mAS and hAS fibrils. Here, we applied state-of-the-art solid-state nuclear magnetic resonance (ssNMR) methods to structurally characterize mAS fibrils. The assignment strategy employed a set of high-resolution 2D and 3D ssNMR spectra recorded on uniformly [(13)C, (15)N], [1-(13)C]glucose, and [2-(13)C]glucose labeled mAS fibrils. An almost complete resonance assignment (96% of backbone amide (15)N and 93% of all (13)C nuclei) was obtained for residues from Gly41 to Val95, which form the core of mAS fibrils. Six β-strands were identified to be within the fibril core of mAS based on a secondary chemical shift and NHHC analysis. Intermolecular (13)C:(15)N labeled restraints obtained from mixed 1:1 (13)C/(15)N-labeled mAS fibrils reveal a parallel, in-register supramolecular β-sheet arrangement. The results were compared in detail to recent structural studies on hAS fibrils and indicate the presence of a structurally conserved motif comprising residues Glu61-Lys80.

Alpha-synuclein forms the major component of Lewy bodies and Lewy neurites, the defining neuropathological characteristics of Parkinson's disease and dementia with Lewy bodies. Here we show that alpha-synuclein is also the major component of the filamentous inclusions of multiple system atrophy which comprises several neurodegenerative diseases with a shared filamentous pathology in nerve cells and glial cells. These findings provide an unexpected link between multiple system atrophy and Lewy body disorders and establish that alpha-synucleinopathies constitute a major class of human neurodegenerative disorder.

Natively disordered proteins are a growing class of anomalies to the structure-function paradigm. The natively disordered protein alpha-synuclein is the primary component of Lewy bodies, the cellular hallmark of Parkinson's disease. We noticed a dramatic difference in dilute solution 1H-15N Heteronuclear Single Quantum Coherence (HSQC) spectra of wild-type alpha-synuclein and two disease-related mutants (A30P and A53T), with spectra collected at 35 degrees C showing fewer cross-peaks than spectra acquired at 10 degrees C. Here, we show the change to be the result of a reversible conformational exchange linked to an increase in hydrodynamic radius and secondary structure as the temperature is raised. Combined with analytical ultracentrifugation data showing alpha-synuclein to be monomeric at both temperatures, we conclude that the poor quality of the 1H-15N HSQC spectra obtained at 35 degrees C is due to conformational fluctuations that occur on the proton chemical shift time scale. Using a truncated variant of alpha-synuclein, we show the conformational exchange occurs in the first 100 amino acids of the protein. Our data illustrate a key difference between globular and natively disordered proteins. The properties of globular proteins change little with solution conditions until they denature cooperatively, but the properties of natively disordered proteins can vary dramatically with solution conditions.

Parkinson's disease (PD) is the second most common neurodegenerative disease. A key pathological feature of PD is Lewy bodies, of which the major protein component is α-synuclein (α-syn). Human genetic studies have shown that mutations (A53T, A30P, E46K) and multiplication of the α-syn gene are linked to familial PD. Mice overexpressing the human A53T mutant α-syn gene develop severe movement disorders. However, the molecular mechanisms of α-syn toxicity are not well understood. Recently, mitochondrial dysfunction has been linked with multiple neurodegenerative diseases including Parkinson's disease. Here we investigated whether mitochondrial motility, dynamics and respiratory function are affected in primary neurons from a mouse model expressing the human A53T mutation. We found that mitochondrial motility was selectively inhibited in A53T neurons while transport of other organelles was not affected. In addition, A53T expressing neurons showed impairment in mitochondrial membrane potential and mitochondrial respiratory function. Furthermore, we found that rapamycin, an autophagy inducer, rescued the decreased mitochondrial mobility. Taken together, these data demonstrate that A53T α-syn impairs mitochondrial function and dynamics and the deficit of mitochondrial transport is reversible, providing further understanding of the disease pathogenesis and a potential therapeutic strategy for PD.

Parkinson's disease (PD) is a neurodegenerative disease with characteristics and symptoms that are well defined. Nevertheless, its aetiology remains unknown. PD is characterized by the presence of Lewy bodies inside neurons. α-Synuclein (α-syn) is a soluble protein present in the pre-synaptic terminal of neurons. Evidence suggests that α-syn has a fundamental role in PD pathogenesis, given that it is an important component of Lewy bodies localized in the dopaminergic neurons of PD patients. In the present study, we investigated the influence of wild type (WT) and A30P α-syn overexpression on neuroblastoma SH-SY5Y toxicity induced by the conditioned medium (CM) from primary cultures of glia challenged with lipopolysaccharide (LPS) from Escherichia coli. We observed that SH-SY5Y cells transduced with α-syn (WT or A30P) and treated with CM from LPS-activated glia cells show evidence of cell death, which is not reverted by NF-κB inhibition by sodium salicylate or by blockage of P50 (NF-κB subunit). Furthermore, the expression of A30P α-syn in neuroblastoma SH-SY5Y decreases the cell death triggered by the CM of activated glia versus WT α-syn or control group. This effect of A30P α-syn may be due to the low MAPK42/44 phosphorylation. This finding is substantiated by MEK1 inhibition by PD98059, decreasing LDH release by CM in SH-SY5Y cells. Our results suggest that SH-SY5Y cells transduced with α-syn (WT or A30P) and treated with CM from LPS-activated glia cells show cell death, which is not reverted by NF-κB blockage. Additionally, the expression of A30P α-syn on neuroblastoma SH-SY5Y leads to decreased cell death triggered by the CM of activated glia, when compared to WT α-syn or control group. The mechanism underlying this process remains to be completely elucidated, but the present data suggest that MAPK42/44 phosphorylation plays an important role in this process. CRD42015020829.

Parkinson's disease (PD) is a neurodegenerative disorder characterized by the appearance of intracytoplasmic inclusions called Lewy bodies (LB) in dopamine neurons in the substantia nigra and the progressive loss of these neurons. Recently, mutations in the alpha-synuclein gene have been identified in early-onset familial PD, and alpha-synuclein has been shown to be a major component of LB in all patients. Yet, the pathophysiological function of alpha-synuclein remains unknown. In this report, we have investigated the toxic effects of adenovirus-mediated alpha-synuclein overexpression on dopamine neurons in rat primary mesencephalic cultures and in a rat dopaminergic cell line - the large T-antigen immortalized, mesencephalon-derived 1RB3AN27 (N27). Adenovirus-transduced cultures showed high-level expression of alpha-synuclein within the cells. Overexpression of human mutant alpha-synuclein (Ala(53)Thr) selectively induced apoptotic programmed cell death of primary dopamine neurons as well as N27 cells. The mutant protein also potentiated the neurotoxicity of 6-hydroxydopamine (6-OHDA). By contrast, overexpression of wild-type human alpha-synuclein was not directly neurotoxic but did increase cell death after 6-OHDA. Overexpression of wild-type rat alpha-synuclein had no effect on dopamine cell survival or 6-OHDA neurotoxicity. These results indicate that overexpression of human mutant alpha-synuclein directly leads to dopamine neuron death, and overexpression of either human mutant or human wild-type alpha-synuclein renders dopamine neurons more vulnerable to neurotoxic insults.

It is increasingly clear that the normal protein alpha-synuclein is in some manner closely associated with presynaptic components of select neuronal types within the adult human central nervous system (CNS) and, in addition, that in its pathologically altered state alpha-synuclein aggregates selectively in the form of filamentous inclusion bodies during certain progressive neurodegenerative disorders, such as familial and sporadic Parkinson's disease. By having the antibody AFshp raised specifically to alpha-synuclein to label Parkinson disease-specific Lewy bodies and Lewy neurites as well as synaptic boutons containing the unaltered protein, an initial attempt is made to map the overall distribution pattern and describe the staining behavior of the immunoreactive punctae in select regions of the prosencephalon. Neocortical immunolabeling is most prominent in the prodigious, but incompletely myelinated, association fields and faintest in the heavily myelinated primary motor and primary sensory fields, with the premotor and first order sensory association areas occupying an intermediate position. Of the thalamic grays evaluated, those containing powerfully myelinated fiber tracts (e.g. centrum medianum, habenular complex) show the weakest immunolabeling, whereas, less sturdily myelinated structures are highly immunoreactive. The fact that the immunostaining spectrum for normal alpha-synuclein is so broad, together with the fact that some thalamic sites actually are immunonegative leads to the following conclusions (1) alpha-synuclein, although present in the synaptic boutons of many nerve cells in the adult human CNS, is by no means ubiquitous there, and (2) neuronal types lacking the normal protein cannot generate the Parkinson's disease-specific filamentous pathology.

The protein alpha-synuclein (AS) is the primary fibrillar component of Lewy bodies, the pathological hallmark of Parkinson's disease. Wild-type human AS and the three mutant forms linked to Parkinson's disease (A53T, A30P, and E46K) all form fibrils through a nucleation-dependent pathway; however, the biophysical details of these fibrillation events are not yet well understood. Atomic-level structural insight is required in order to elucidate the potential role of AS fibrils in Parkinson's disease. Here we show that low temperature acquisition of magic-angle spinning NMR spectra of wild type AS fibrils-greatly enhances spectral sensitivity, enabling the detection of a substantially larger number of spin systems. At 0 +/- 3 degrees C sample temperature, cross polarization (CP) experiments yield weak signals. Lower temperature spectra (-40 +/- 3 degrees C) demonstrated several times greater signal intensity, an effect further amplified in 3D 15N-13C-13C experiments, which are required to perform backbone assignments on this sample. Thus 3D experiments enabled assignments of most amino acids in the rigid part of the fibril (approximately residues 64 to 94), as well as tentative site-specific assignments for T22, V26, A27, Y39, G41, S42, H50, V52, A53, T54, V55, V63, A107, I112, and S129. Most of these signals were not observed in 2D or 3D spectra at 0 +/- 3 degrees C. Spectra acquired at low temperatures therefore permitted more complete chemical shift assignments. Observation of the majority of residues in AS fibrils represents an important step towards solving the 3D structure.

Parkinson's disease (PD) is one of many neurodegenerative diseases that are characterized by amyloid fibril formation. Alpha-synuclein is a primary component of the fibrillar neuronal inclusions, known as Lewy bodies, that are diagnostic of PD. In addition, the alpha-synuclein gene is linked to familial PD. Fibril formation by alpha-synuclein proceeds via discrete beta-sheet-rich oligomers, or protofibrils, that are consumed as fibrils grow. Both FPD mutations accelerate formation of protofibrils, suggesting that these intermediates, rather than the fibril product, trigger neuronal loss. In idiopathic PD, other factors may be responsible for accelerating protofibril formation by wild-type alpha-synuclein. One possible factor could be molecular crowding in the neuronal cytoplasm. We demonstrate here that crowding using inert polymers significantly reduced the lag time for protofibril formation and the conversion of the protofibril to the fibril, but did not affect the morphology of either species. Physiologically realistic changes in the degree of in vitro crowding have significant kinetic consequences. Thus, nonspecific changes in the total cytoplasmic protein concentration, induced by cell volume changes and/or altered protein degradation, could promote formation of and stabilize the alpha-synuclein protofibril.

Alpha-synuclein (alphaS) is the primary component of Lewy bodies, the pathological hallmark of Parkinson's Disease. Aggregation of alphaS is thought to proceed from a primarily disordered state with nascent secondary structure through intermediate conformations to oligomeric forms and finally to mature amyloid fibrils. Low pH conditions lead to conformational changes associated with increased alphaS fibril formation. Here we characterize these structural and dynamic changes using solution state NMR measurements of secondary chemical shifts, relaxation parameters, residual dipolar couplings, and paramagnetic relaxation enhancement. We find that the neutralization of negatively charged side-chains eliminates electrostatic repulsion in the C-terminal tail of alphaS and leads to a collapse of this region at low pH. Hydrophobic contacts between the compact C-terminal tail and the NAC (non-amyloid-beta component) region are maintained and may lead to the formation of a globular domain. Transient long-range contacts between the C-terminus of the protein and regions N-terminal to the NAC region are also preserved. Thus, the release of long-range contacts does not play a role in the increased aggregation of alphaS at low pH, which we instead attribute to the increased hydrophobicity of the protein.

The manifestation of Lewy bodies (LB) in the brain is a hallmark of Parkinson's disease. Here, we present a comprehensive analysis of protein elements in Lewy bodies by comparative mass spectrometry. Cortical LB inclusions were enriched by sucrose gradient centrifugation from postmortem brains, and a negative control sample was prepared from specimen without LB pathology. Whereas approximately 550 proteins were identified in the LB-enriched sample by mass spectrometry, quantitative comparison with the control sample revealed that approximately 40 proteins were co-enriched with alpha-synuclein, the major component in Lewy bodies. As expected, the list of proteins included previously reported constituents, such as those involved in protein folding, membrane trafficking and oxidative stress. More interestingly, we discovered in the LB-enriched sample several kinases (MAPKK1/MEK1, protein kinase C, and doublecortin-like kinase), a novel deubiquitinating enzyme (otubain 1), and numerous ubiquitin ligases (KPC and SCF). The proteomic studies provide enzyme candidates to investigate the regulation of alpha-synuclein and/or other LB proteins, which may contribute to the formation of Lewy bodies and the toxicity of alpha-synuclein in the related neurodegenerative disorders.

Alpha-synuclein is believed to play an important role in Parkinson's disease (PD). Mutations in the alpha-synuclein gene are responsible for familial forms of PD and alpha-synuclein protein is a major component of Lewy bodies in patients with sporadic PD. Synphilin-1 is a novel protein that we have previously found to associate in vivo with alpha-synuclein. We now show that synphilin-1 is present in Lewy bodies of patients with PD. Our data suggest that synphilin-1 could play a role in Lewy body formation and the pathogenesis of PD.

α-Synuclein is the major protein component of Lewy bodies--the pathological hallmark of Parkinson's disease (PD) and Dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB). Its accumulation into intracellular aggregates is implicated in the process of Lewy body formation. However, its roles in both normal function, and disease, remain controversial. Using a novel model of chronic oxidative stress in cultured dopaminergic and cortical neurons, we report that endogenous α-synuclein is upregulated in response to low dose toxicity. This response is conserved between subpopulations of cortical and dopaminergic neurons, and confers relative resistance to apoptosis following secondary insult. Additional acute oxidative stress leads to intracellular accumulation of α-synuclein. These punctate deposits colocalize with ubiquitin, which is central to proteosome-mediated protein degeneration, and is the second major component of Lewy bodies. The current results imply that differential levels of α-synuclein expression may influence neuronal vulnerability in chronic neurodegenerative diseases. They further support a 'two hit' hypothesis for Lewy body formation, whereby mild stress causes a protective upregulation of α-synuclein. However, such increased levels of α-synuclein may drive its accumulation, following additional toxic insult. Finally, these results support a common mechanism for degeneration of dopaminergic and cortical neurons, affected in PD, and DLB, respectively.

Dementia with Lewy bodies is an α-synucleinopathy characterized by neocortical Lewy-related pathology (LRP). We carried out a genome-wide association study (GWAS) on neocortical LRP in a population-based sample of subjects aged 85 or over. LRP was analyzed in 304 subjects in the Vantaa 85+ sample from Southern Finland. The GWAS included 41 cases with midbrain, hippocampal, and neocortical LRP and 177 controls without midbrain and hippocampal LRP. The Medical Research Council Cognitive Function and Ageing Study (CFAS) material was used for replication (51 cases and 131 controls). By analyzing 327,010 markers the top signal was obtained at the HLA-DPA1/DPB1 locus (P = 1.29 × 10(-7)); five other loci on chromosomes 15q14, 2p21, 2q31, 18p11, and 5q23 were associated with neocortical LRP at P < 10(-5). Two loci were marked by multiple markers, 2p21 (P = 3.9 × 10(-6), upstream of the SPTBN1 gene), and HLA-DPA1/DPB1; these were tested in the CFAS material. Single marker (P = 0.0035) and haplotype (P = 0.04) associations on 2p21 were replicated in CFAS, whereas HLA-DPA1/DPB1 association was not. Bioinformatic analyses suggest functional effects for the HLA-DPA1/DPB1 markers as well as the 15q14 marker rs8037309. We identified suggestive novel risk factors for neocortical LRP. SPTBN1 is the candidate on 2p21, it encodes beta-spectrin, an α-synuclein binding protein and a component of Lewy bodies. The HLA-DPA1/DPB1 association suggests a role for antigen presentation or alternatively, cis-regulatory effects, one of the regulated neighboring genes identified here (vacuolar protein sorting 52) plays a role in vesicular trafficking and has been shown to interact with α-synuclein in a yeast model.

alpha-Synuclein and ubiquitin are two Lewy body protein components that may play antagonistic roles in the pathogenesis of Lewy bodies. We examined the relationship between alpha-synuclein, ubiquitin, and lipids in Lewy bodies of fixed brain sections or isolated from cortical tissues of dementia with Lewy bodies. Lewy bodies exhibited a range of labeling patterns for alpha-synuclein and ubiquitin, from a homogeneous pattern in which alpha-synuclein and ubiquitin were evenly distributed and overlapped across the inclusion body to a concentric pattern in which alpha-synuclein and ubiquitin were partially segregated, with alpha-synuclein labeling concentrated in the peripheral domain and ubiquitin in the central domain of the Lewy body. Lipids represented a significant component in both homogeneous and concentric Lewy bodies. These results suggest that Lewy bodies are heterogeneous in their subregional composition. The segregation of alpha-synuclein to Lewy body peripheral domain is consistent with the hypothesis that alpha-synuclein is continually deposited onto Lewy bodies.

Alpha-synuclein (α-Syn) is the principal protein component of Lewy bodies, a pathological hallmark of Parkinson's disease (PD). This protein may regulate protein phosphatase 2A (PP2A) activity, although the molecular mechanisms for α-Syn-mediated regulation of PP2A and the potential neuroprotective actions of PP2A against PD-associated pathology remain largely unexplored. We found that α-Syn gene overexpression in SK-N-SH cells and primary neurons led to PP2A/C phosphorylation at Y307, a known target of Src kinase, and consequent phosphatase inhibition. In addition, phospho-activated Src (p-Y416 Src, pSrc) was higher in SK-N-SH cells and primary neurons overexpressing α-Syn. Thus, α-Syn may promote Src activation and PP2A inactivation, leading to hyperphosphorylation of proteins. Immunoprecipitation revealed higher calmodulin/Src complex formation in α-Syn-overexpressing cells and α-Syn transgenic mice. A TUNEL apoptosis assay and an MTT cell viability assay demonstrated that the PP2A activator C2-ceramide protected neurons against α-Syn-induced cell injury. Buffering the Ca(2+) elevations induced by α-Syn overexpression ameliorated the cytotoxicity of α-Syn. Our findings define a potential molecular mechanism for α-Syn-mediated regulation of PP2A through formation of the calmodulin/Src complex, activation of Src, and Src-mediated phospho-inhibition of PP2A. Overexpression of α-Syn may lead to neurodegeneration in PD in part by suppressing the endogenous neuroprotective activity of PP2A.

Parkinson's disease (PD) is characterized by the progressive loss of substantia nigra dopaminergic neurons and the presence of cytoplasmic inclusions named Lewy bodies. Two missense mutations of the alpha-synuclein (alpha-syn; A30P and A53T) have been described in several families with an autosomal dominant form of PD. alpha-Syn also constitutes one of the main components of Lewy bodies in sporadic cases of PD. To develop an animal model of PD, lentiviral vectors expressing different human or rat forms of alpha-syn were injected into the substantia nigra of rats. In contrast to transgenic mice models, a selective loss of nigral dopaminergic neurons associated with a dopaminergic denervation of the striatum was observed in animals expressing either wild-type or mutant forms of human alpha-syn. This neuronal degeneration correlates with the appearance of abundant alpha-syn-positive inclusions and extensive neuritic pathology detected with both alpha-syn and silver staining. Lentiviral-mediated expression of wild-type or mutated forms of human alpha-syn recapitulates the essential neuropathological features of PD. Rat alpha-syn similarly leads to protein aggregation but without cell loss, suggesting that inclusions are not the primary cause of cell degeneration in PD. Viral-mediated genetic models may contribute to elucidate the mechanism of alpha-syn-induced cell death and allow the screening of candidate therapeutic molecules.

Synucleinopathies comprise a diverse group of neurodegenerative proteinopathies that share common pathological lesions composed of aggregates of conformational and posttranslational modifications of alpha-synuclein in selected populations of neurons and glia. Abnormal filamentous aggregates of misfolded alpha-synuclein protein are the major components of Lewy bodies, dystrophic (Lewy) neurites, and the Papp-Lantos filaments in oligodendroglia and neurons in multiple system atrophy linked to degeneration of affected brain regions. The synucleinopathies include (1) Lewy body disorders and dementia with Lewy bodies, (2) multiple system atrophy (MSA), and (3) Hallervorden-Spatz disease. (1) The pathological diagnosis of Lewy body disorders and dementia with Lewy bodies is established by validated consensus criteria based on semiquantitative assessment of subcortical and cortical Lewy bodies as their common hallmarks. They are accompanied by subcortical multisystem degeneration with neuronal loss and gliosis with or without Alzheimer pathologic state. Lewy bodies also occur in numerous other disorders, including pure autonomic failure, neuroaxonal dystrophies, and various amyloidoses and tauopathies. (2) Multiple system atrophy, a sporadic, adult-onset degenerative movement disorder of unknown cause, is characterized by alpha-synuclein-positive glial cytoplasmic and rare neuronal inclusions throughout the central nervous system associated with striatonigral degeneration, olivopontocerebellar atrophy, and involvement of medullar and spinal autonomic nuclei. (3) In neurodegeneration with brain iron accumulation type I, or Hallervorden-Spatz disease, alpha-synuclein is present in axonal spheroids and glial and neuronal inclusions. While the identity of the major components of Lewy bodies suggests that a pathway leading from normal soluble to abnormal misfolded filamentous proteins is central for their pathogenesis, regardless of the primary disorder, there are conformational differences in alpha-synuclein between neuronal and glial aggregates, showing nonuniform mapping for its epitopes. Despite several cellular and transgenic models, it is not clear whether inclusion body formation is an adaptive/neuroprotective or a pathogenic reaction/process generated in response to different, mostly undetermined, functional triggers linked to neurodegeneration.

The protein alpha-synuclein (ASYN) is thought to be involved in the development of dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB). Overexpression of ASYN has been linked to cellular toxicity and human disease, and in experimental models, chaperones such as heat shock proteins (HSPs) are protective against ASYN toxicity. We have assessed the abundance of mRNA for ASYN and chaperones and the abundance and solubility of the encoded proteins in temporal cortex from sporadic human DLB. We found a reduction of ASYN mRNA in DLB (44.9% of control). The abundance of the Triton-soluble fraction (bioavailable protein) was not altered, but there was an increase of the Triton-insoluble component (likely representing aggregates). We evaluated 3 chaperones: HSP70, HSP90, and HDJ1. HSP70 mRNA was increased in DLB, whereas the mRNAs for HSP90 and HDJ1 were unchanged. HSP70 accumulated in the Triton-soluble fraction, whereas HSP90 and HDJ1 proteins accumulated in the Triton-insoluble fraction. These observations suggest that sporadic DLB is not associated with overexpression of ASYN. Rather, the persistence of normal soluble ASYN protein levels, despite the reduction of its mRNA, suggests a primary defect in clearance of the protein. However, this reduced clearance cannot be attributed to a failure of chaperone expression, because their mRNA is unchanged or increased in the DLB brain.

α-Synuclein is the major pathological component of synucleinopathies including Parkinson's disease and dementia with Lewy bodies. Recent studies have demonstrated that α-synuclein also plays important roles in the release of synaptic vesicles and synaptic membrane recycling in healthy neurons. However, the precise relationship between the pathogenicity and physiological functions of α-synuclein remains to be elucidated. To address this issue, we investigated the subcellular localization of α-synuclein in normal and pathological conditions using primary mouse hippocampal neuronal cultures. While some neurons expressed high levels of α-synuclein in presynaptic boutons and cell bodies, other neurons either did not or only very weakly expressed the protein. These α-synuclein-negative cells were identified as inhibitory neurons by immunostaining with specific antibodies against glutamic acid decarboxylase (GAD), parvalbumin, and somatostatin. In contrast, α-synuclein-positive synapses were colocalized with the excitatory synapse marker vesicular glutamate transporter-1. This expression profile of α-synuclein was conserved in the hippocampus in vivo. In addition, we found that while presynaptic α-synuclein colocalizes with synapsin, a marker of presynaptic vesicles, it is not essential for activity-dependent membrane recycling induced by high potassium treatment. Exogenous supply of preformed fibrils generated by recombinant α-synuclein was shown to promote the formation of Lewy body (LB) -like intracellular aggregates involving endogenous α-synuclein. GAD-positive neurons did not form LB-like aggregates following treatment with preformed fibrils, however, exogenous expression of human α-synuclein allowed intracellular aggregate formation in these cells. These results suggest the presence of a different mechanism for regulation of the expression of α-synuclein between excitatory and inhibitory neurons. Furthermore, α-synuclein expression levels may determine the efficiency of intracellular aggregate formation in different neuronal subtypes.

Lewy bodies and Lewy neurites are the defining neuropathological characteristics of Parkinson's disease and dementia with Lewy bodies. They are made of abnormal filamentous assemblies of unknown composition. We show here that Lewy bodies and Lewy neurites from Parkinson's disease and dementia with Lewy bodies are stained strongly by antibodies directed against amino-terminal and carboxyl-terminal sequences of alpha-synuclein, showing the presence of full-length or close to full-length alpha-synuclein. The number of alpha-synuclein-stained structures exceeded that immunoreactive for ubiquitin, which is currently the most sensitive marker of Lewy bodies and Lewy neurites. Staining for alpha-synuclein thus will replace staining for ubiquitin as the preferred method for detecting Lewy bodies and Lewy neurites. We have isolated Lewy body filaments by a method used for the extraction of paired helical filaments from Alzheimer's disease brain. By immunoelectron microscopy, extracted filaments were labeled strongly by anti-alpha-synuclein antibodies. The morphologies of the 5- to 10-nm filaments and their staining characteristics suggest that extended alpha-synuclein molecules run parallel to the filament axis and that the filaments are polar structures. These findings indicate that alpha-synuclein forms the major filamentous component of Lewy bodies and Lewy neurites.

Parkinson's disease (PD) is characterized as a neurodegenerative movement disorder presenting with rigidity, resting tremor, disturbances in balance and slowness in movement. An important pathologic feature of PD is the presence of Lewy bodies. The primary structural component of Lewy bodies are fibrils composed primarily of alpha-synuclein, a highly conserved 140 amino acid protein that is predominantly expressed in neurons and which may play a role in synaptic plasticity and neurotransmission. Numerous studies suggest the aggregation and modification of alpha-synuclein as a key step leading to Lewy body formation and neuronal cell loss associated with PD. Because of the central role of alpha-synuclein in PD, it represents a novel drug target for the possible treatment of this disease. In this review, an overview of the role of alpha-synuclein in PD will be discussed with an emphasis on recent studies utilizing an immunization approach against alpha-synuclein as a possible treatment option for this debilitating disease.

α-Synuclein (αSyn), which forms amyloid fibrils, is linked to the neuronal pathology of Parkinson's disease, as it is the major fibrillar component of Lewy bodies, the inclusions that are characteristic of the disease. Oligomeric structures, common to many neurodegenerative disease-related proteins, may in fact be the primary toxic species, while the amyloid fibrils exist either as a less toxic dead-end species or even as a beneficial mechanism for clearing damaged proteins. To alter the progression of the aggregation and gain insights into the prefibrillar structures, we determined the effect of heme on αSyn oligomerization by several different techniques, including native (nondenaturing) polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, thioflavin T fluorescence, transmission electron microscopy, atomic force microscopy, circular dichroism, and membrane permeation using a calcein release assay. During aggregation, heme is able to bind the αSyn in a specific fashion, stabilizing distinct oligomeric conformations and promoting the formation of αSyn into annular structures, thereby delaying and/or inhibiting the fibrillation process. These results indicate that heme may play a regulatory role in the progression of Parkinson's disease; in addition, they provide insights into how the aggregation process may be altered, which may be applicable to the understanding of many neurodegenerative diseases.

Alpha-synuclein (α-syn) is the main protein component of Lewy bodies (LBs), that together with nigrostriatal dopamine neuron loss constitute typical pathological hallmarks of Parkinson's disease (PD). Glutamate N-methyl-d-aspartate receptor (NMDAR) abnormalities, peculiarly involving NR2B-containing NMDAR, have been observed in the brain of PD patients and in several experimental models of the disease. Recent findings, indicating that α-syn can modulate NMDAR trafficking and function, suggest that this protein may be a pivotal regulator of NMDAR activity. Prompted by these evidences, we used fluorescence immunocytochemistry, western blotting and ratiometric Ca(2+) measurements to investigate whether wild type (wt) or C-terminally truncated α-syn can specifically modulate NR2B-containing NMDAR levels, subcellular trafficking and function. In addition, we evaluated whether the exposure of primary cortical neurons to increasing concentrations of rotenone could differentially regulate NR2B levels and cell viability in the presence or in the absence of α-syn. Our results indicate that both wt and C-terminally truncated α-syn negatively modulate NR2B-containing NMDAR levels, membrane translocation and function. Moreover, we found that absence of α-syn abolishes the rotenone-dependent decrease of NR2B levels and reduces neuronal vulnerability in primary cortical neurons. These findings suggest that α-syn can modulate neuronal resilience by regulating NR2B-containing NMDAR, whose specific alterations could connect α-syn pathology to neuronal degeneration in PD.

Lewy bodies, the characteristic pathological lesion of substantia nigra neurons in Parkinson's disease (PD), are frequently observed to accompany the amyloid plaque and neurofibrillary tangle pathology of Alzheimer's disease (AD). However the typical anatomic distribution of Lewy bodies in AD is distinct from PD. The most common site of occurrence is the amygdala, where Lewy bodies are observed in approximately 60% of both sporadic and familial AD. Other common sites of occurrence include the periamygdaloid and entorhinal cortex, while neocortical and brainstem areas develop Lewy bodies in a lower percentage of cases. In contrast, dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB), defined by widespread neocortical and brainstem Lewy bodies but frequently accompanied by variable levels of AD-type pathology, represents the other end of a spectrum of pathology associated with dementia. The observation of Lewy bodies in familial AD cases suggests that like neurofibrillary tangles, the formation of Lewy bodies can be induced by the pathological state caused by Abeta-amyloid overproduction. The role of Lewy body formation in the dysfunction and degeneration of neurons remains unclear. The protein alpha-synuclein appears to be an important structural component of Lewy bodies, an observation spurred by the discovery of point mutations in the alpha-synuclein gene linked to rare cases of autosomal dominant PD. Further investigation of alpha-synuclein and its relationship to pathological conditions promoting Lewy body formation in AD, PD, and DLB may yield further insight into pathogenesis of these diseases.

Mutations of the alpha-synuclein gene have shown to be relevant in some rare families with autosomal dominant Parkinson's disease (PD). Furthermore, alpha-synuclein protein is a major component of the Lewy bodies also in sporadic PD patients. Increased levels of wildtype alpha-synuclein in the cell leads to increased intracellular hydrogen peroxide levels and causes death of dopaminergic neurons in rat primary culture. Subsequently, oxidative stress has been directly linked with alpha-synuclein aggregation in vitro. This raises the question whether increased alpha-synuclein expression might be linked to higher susceptibility to PD and whether alpha-synuclein promoter polymorphisms are associated with PD. Here, two polymorphisms (-116C>G and -668T>C) of the alpha-synuclein promoter defining four haplotypes have been characterized in 315 German PD patients. The influence of the four haplotypes on gene expression was studied by CAT reporter gene assays in neuronal SK-N-AS cells. The -668C/-116G haplotype revealed significant higher CAT expression than the -668T/-116G or the -668T/-116C haplotype, respectively. Although the -668C/-116G haplotype was more common in PD patients, this difference was not significant.

The major protein constituent of Lewy bodies (LBs), the pathological hallmark of Parkinson disease and dementia with Lewy bodies, is considered to be alpha-synuclein, but other proteins, in particular the microtubule-associated protein tau, have been implicated in the pathogenesis of LBs. Tau is the major structural component of neurofibrillary tangles (NFTs). Both direct immunochemical studies of partially purified LBs and indirect immunohistochemical studies have suggested that LBs may contain tau, but most of these studies were based upon a single tau antibody, and immunologic cross-reactivity was not completely excluded. To gain insight into the relation between tau and alpha-synuclein in LBs, double immunostaining was performed in Lewy body cases with a rabbit polyclonal antibody to alpha-synuclein and a panel of monoclonal antibodies to phospho- and nonphospho-tau epitopes (Alz50, CP9, CP13, PG5, TG3, PHFI) that spanned the length of the tau molecule. Tau-immunoreactive LBs were present in the medulla in 80% of the cases, irrespective of Braak stage. All tau antibodies recognized at least some LBs, arguing against nonspecific antibody cross-reactivity. In most lesions the tau immunostaining was present at the periphery of the LB. The phospho-tau antibody, TG3, detected more LBs than any of the other tau antibodies. The proportion of LBs with tau immunoreactivity was greatest in neurons vulnerable to NETs, such as those in the locus ceruleus and basal nucleus of Meynert, and least in neurons resistant to NFTs, such as the dorsal motor nucleus of the vagus in the medulla. The present results suggest that tau may coaggregate with alpha-synuclein in LBs, especially in neuronal populations vulnerable to both NFTs and LBs.

Parkinson's disease is the most common neurodegenerative movement disorder. α-Synuclein is a small synaptic protein that has been linked to familial Parkinson's disease (PD) and is also the primary component of Lewy bodies, the hallmark neuropathology found in the brain of sporadic and familial PD patients. The function of α-synuclein is currently unknown, although it has been implicated in the regulation of synaptic vesicle localization or fusion. Recently, overexpression of α-synuclein was shown to cause cytoplasmic vesicle accumulation in a yeast model of α-synuclein toxicity, but the exact role α-synuclein played in mediating this vesicle aggregation is unclear. Here, we show that α-synuclein induces aggregation of many yeast Rab GTPase proteins, that α-synuclein aggregation is enhanced in yeast mutants that produce high levels of acidic phospholipids, and that α-synuclein colocalizes with yeast membranes that are enriched for phosphatidic acid. Significantly, we demonstrate that α-synuclein expression induces vulnerability to perturbations of Ypt6 and other proteins involved in retrograde endosome-Golgi transport, linking a specific trafficking defect to α-synuclein phospholipid binding. These data suggest new pathogenic mechanisms for α-synuclein neurotoxicity.
