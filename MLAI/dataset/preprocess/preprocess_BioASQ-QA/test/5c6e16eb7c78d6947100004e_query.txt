Sweat chloride testing for diagnosis of cystic fibrosis (CF) involves sweat induction, collection and handling, and measurement in an analytical lab. We have developed a wearable sensor with an integrated salt bridge for real-time measurement of sweat chloride concentration. Here, in a proof-of-concept study, we compare the performance of the sensor to current clinical practice in CF patients and healthy subjects. Sweat was induced on both forearms of 10 individuals with CF and 10 healthy subjects using pilocarpine iontophoresis. A Macroduct sweat collection device was attached to one arm and sweat was collected for 30 min and then sent for laboratory analysis. A sensor was attached to the other arm and the chloride ion concentration monitored in real time for 30 min using a Bluetooth transceiver and smart phone app. Stable sweat chloride measurements were obtained within 15 min following sweat induction using the wearable sensor. We define the detection time as the time at which the standard deviation of the real-time chloride ion concentration remained below 2 mEq/L for 5 min. The sweat volume for sensor measurements at the detection time was 13.1 ± 11.4 μL (SD), in many cases lower than the minimum sweat volume of 15 μL for conventional testing. The mean difference between sweat chloride concentrations measured by the sensor and the conventional laboratory practice was 6.2 ± 9.5 mEq/L (SD), close to the arm-to-arm variation of about 3 mEq/L. The Pearson correlation coefficient between the two measurements was 0.97 highlighting the excellent agreement between the two methods. A wearable sensor can be used to make real-time measurements of sweat chloride within 15 min following sweat induction, requiring a small sweat volume, and with excellent agreement to standard methods.

The components of sweat provide an array of potential biomarkers for health and disease. Sweat chloride is of interest as a biomarker for cystic fibrosis, electrolyte metabolism disorders, electrolyte balance, and electrolyte loss during exercise. Developing wearable sensors for biomarkers in sweat is a major technological challenge. Potentiometric sensors provide a relatively simple technology for on-body sweat chloride measurement, however, equilibration between reference and test solutions has limited the time over which accurate measurements can be made. Here, we report on a wearable potentiometric chloride sweat sensor. We performed parametric studies to show how the salt bridge geometry determines equilibration between the reference and test solutions. From these results, we show a sweat chloride sensor can be designed to provide accurate measurements over extended times. We then performed on-body tests on healthy subjects while exercising to establish the feasibility of using this technology as a wearable device.

The cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) gene mutation identification is being used with increased frequency to aid in the diagnosis of cystic fibrosis (CF) in those suspected with CF. Aim of this study was to identify diagnostic outcomes when CFTR mutational analysis was used in CF diagnosis. CFTR mutational analysis results were also compared with sweat chloride results. This study was done on all patients at our institution who had CFTR mutation analysis over a sevenyear period since August 2006. A total of 315 patients underwent CFTR mutational analysis. Fifty-one (16.2%) patients had two mutations identified. Among them 32 had positive sweat chloride levels (≥60 mmol/L), while seven had borderline sweat chloride levels (40-59 mmol/L). An additional 70 patients (22.3%) had only one mutation identified. Among them eight had positive sweat chloride levels, and 17 had borderline sweat chloride levels. Fifty-five patients (17.5%) without CFTR mutations had either borderline (n=45) or positive (n=10) sweat chloride results. Three patients with a CF phenotype had negative CFTR analysis but elevated sweat chloride levels. In eighty-three patients (26.4%) CFTR mutational analysis was done without corresponding sweat chloride testing. Although CFTR mutation analysis has improved the diagnostic capability for CF, its use either as the first step or the only test to diagnose CFTR dysfunction should be discouraged and CF diagnostic guidelines need to be followed.

The sweat chloride test remains the gold standard for confirmatory diagnosis of cystic fibrosis (CF) in support of universal newborn screening programs. However, it provides ambiguous results for intermediate sweat chloride cases while not reflecting disease progression when classifying the complex CF disease spectrum given the pleiotropic effects of gene modifiers and environment. Herein we report the first characterization of the sweat metabolome from screen-positive CF infants and identify metabolites associated with disease status that complement sweat chloride testing. Pilocarpine-stimulated sweat specimens were collected independently from two CF clinics, including 50 unaffected infants (e.g., carriers) and 18 confirmed CF cases. Nontargeted metabolite profiling was performed using multisegment injection-capillary electrophoresis-mass spectrometry as a high throughput platform for analysis of polar/ionic metabolites in volume-restricted sweat samples. Amino acids, organic acids, amino acid derivatives, dipeptides, purine derivatives, and unknown exogenous compounds were identified in sweat when using high resolution tandem mass spectrometry, including metabolites associated with affected yet asymptomatic CF infants, such as asparagine and glutamine. Unexpectedly, a metabolite of pilocarpine, used to stimulate sweat secretion, pilocarpic acid, and a plasticizer metabolite from environmental exposure, mono(2-ethylhexyl)phthalic acid, were secreted in the sweat of CF infants at significantly lower concentrations relative to unaffected CF screen-positive controls. These results indicated a deficiency in human paraoxonase, an enzyme unrelated to mutations to the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) and impaired chloride transport, which is a nonspecific arylesterase/lactonase known to mediate inflammation, bacterial biofilm formation, and recurrent lung infections in affected CF children later in life. This work sheds new light into the underlying mechanisms of CF pathophysiology as required for new advances in precision medicine of orphan diseases that benefit from early detection and intervention, including new molecular targets for therapeutic intervention.

Surveys in USA and UK have shown inconsistencies between practice of sweat testing and guidelines of the National Committee for Clinical Laboratory Standards (NCCLS), which could increase the risk of false-positive and -negative results. To determine the current practice of sweat testing in German cystic fibrosis (CF)-centres a survey was performed. A questionnaire was mailed to all 123 German CF-centres that join the German CF-register. The results were compared with the NCCLS-guidelines. 88 out of 113 responding centres perform 30-1100 (median 200) sweat tests by pilocarpine iontophoresis per year. The recommended sweat sample time of 20-30 min was accepted by 33% of all centres. Minimum acceptable sweat rates were quoted between 100 and 7500 (median 1000) mg/m (2)/min differing from the recommended 1000 mg/m (2)/min. Osmolality was measured in 3%, sodium in 24% and conductivity in 53% of the centres. Chloride, the only accepted diagnostic measurement by the NCCLS, was investigated by only 58% of all centres. The recommended chloride CF-reference value of >60 mmol/l was used in 78% of centres that perform chloride testing. Major areas of inconsistencies between sweat testing practice in German CF-centres and NCCLS-guidelines are sweat collection, analyzing method and reference values. Chloride, the only accepted diagnostic measurement by the NCCLS, was investigated only by 58% of all centres.

Cystic fibrosis (CF) is an autosomal recessive condition that has an incidence of 1:2500 live births in Northern Europe. Due to the large number of mutations that can result in classical or atypical CF phenotype, the sweat test, which quantifies the amount of chloride and sodium in sweat, is vital in supporting the diagnosis of CF. Patients with CF have raised concentrations of chloride and sodium in their sweat; however, it is the concentration of chloride in sweat which provides the greatest diagnostic sensitivity for CF. An inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (ICP-MS) method for the analysis of sweat chloride and sodium was evaluated for the routine measurement of sweat collected using the Wescor Macroduct(®) Sweat Collection System. The precision, linearity and agreement with the all laboratories trimmed means (ALTMs) and 'weighed-in' concentrations of sodium and chloride in samples supplied by the UK NEQAS external quality assessment (EQA) Sweat Testing Scheme were assessed. This ICP-MS method for the quantification of chloride and sodium in sweat samples was shown to be accurate, precise and suitable for the routine analysis of sweat chloride and sodium. The method performs well and is now used in the routine analysis of sweat in this laboratory.

Sweat chloride measurement is considered a standard diagnostic tool for cystic fibrosis (CF). This study was performed to compare sweat chloride values obtained by quantitative pilocarpine iontophoresis (classic test) with sweat crystallization detected by direct observation of a drop of perspiration under light microscopy in patients with and without CF. The tests using both techniques were performed simultaneously in patients with and without CF. Cutoff values of ≥60 mmol/L of chloride concentration for the classic sweat test was considered for diagnosis of CF. In crystallization method, observation of typical dendritic forms of salt crystals under light microscopy was interpreted positive. Sixty patients suspected to CF (31 males and 29 females) with age range of 9 months to 2 years underwent the sweat test using both techniques. Median sweat chloride values was 26.13+10.85 in group with negative and 72.76+12.78 mmol/L in group with positive sweat test, respectively. All the patients who had positive sweat test in classic method showed typical dendritic forms of salt crystal in sweat crystallization test, which provided the test with 100% sensitivity (95%CI: 93.1-100). Only one of the 31 subjects with negative results for classic sweat test had positive result for crystallization sweat test, which provided the test with 96.7% specificity (95%CI: 92.9-100). Time spent to perform the crystallization test was significantly shorter than the classic method whereas its cost was also lower than the second method. There was a good correspondence between two studied methods of sweat test. These results suggested the sweat crystallization test as an alternative test for detecting CF disease with high sensitivity and specificity.

Cystic fibrosis (CF) is a complex autosomal recessive disease that continues to present unique diagnostic challenges. Because CF was first described in 1938, there has been a substantial growth of genetic and phenotypic information about the disorder. During the past few years, as more evidence has become available, a consortium of international experts determined that the 2008 guidelines from the CF Foundation needed to be reviewed and updated. The goal of this review is to highlight the latest advances in CF multidisciplinary care, together with the recent updates to the 2017 CF Foundation diagnostic guidelines. Data from newborn screening programs, patient registries, clinical databases, and functional research have led to a better understanding of the CF transmembrane conductance regulator (<i>CFTR</i>) gene. Recent consensus guidelines have provided recommendations for clinicians and laboratorians to better assist with interpretation of disease status and related CF mutations. The highly recommended Clinical and Functional Translation of <i>CFTR</i> project should be the first resource in the evaluation of disease severity for CF mutations. Screen-positive newborns and patients with high clinical suspicion for CF are always recommended to undergo confirmatory sweat chloride testing with interpretations based on updated reference intervals. Every patient diagnosed with CF should receive genotyping, as novel molecular therapies are becoming standard of practice. The future of CF management must consider healthcare system disparities as CF transitions from a historically childhood disease to a predominantly adult epidemic.

Cystic fibrosis is a chronic progressive autosomal recessive disorder caused by the CFTR gene mutations. It is quite common in Caucasians, but very rare in Asians. Sweat chloride test is known to be a screening test for the cystic fibrosis due to the fact that electrolyte levels in sweat are elevated in patients. In this study, sweat chloride levels in Korean population were measured and analyzed by using standardized pilocarpine iontophoresis sweat chloride test. The sweat chloride test was performed in 47 patients referred to Yondong Severance Hospital from August, 2001 to April, 2007 and 41 healthy volunteers. The sweat chloride tests were conducted according to the CLSI C34-A2 guideline using pilocarpine iontophoresis method, and the chloride concentrations in sweat were measured by mercurimetric titration. Four patients showed sweat chloride concentrations higher than 60 mmol/L. Reference interval was calculated as 1.4-44.5 mmol/L by analysis of the results of healthy volunteers (n=41). Four patients who exhibited high sweat chloride levels, had characteristic clinical features of cystic fibrosis and their diagnoses were confirmed either by repeated sweat chloride test or genetic analysis. Standardized sweat chloride test can be utilized as a useful diagnostic tool for cystic fibrosis in Koreans. In cases of sweat chloride levels higher than 40 mmol/L, the test should be repeated for the possible diagnosis of cystic fibrosis. All the confirmed Korean cases of cystic fibrosis showed sweat chloride level above 60 mmol/L.

Sweat chloride testing is the gold standard for diagnosis of cystic fibrosis (CF). Our objectives were to: 1) describe variables that determine sweat rate; 2) determine the analytic and diagnostic capacity of sweat chloride analysis across the range of observed sweat rates; and 3) determine the biologic variability of sweat chloride concentration. A retrospective analysis was performed using data from all sweat chloride tests performed at St. Louis Children's Hospital over a 21-month period. A total of 1397 sweat chloride tests (1155 sufficient [≥75 mg], 242 insufficient [<75 mg]), were performed on 904 individuals. The sweat weight collected from forearms was statistically greater than that collected from legs. There was a negligible correlation between sweat weight and chloride concentration (r=-0.06). The mean individual biologic CV calculated from individuals with two or more sweat collections ≥75 mg was 13.1% (95% CI: 11.3-14.9%; range 0-88%) yielding a reference change value of 36%. Using 60 mmol/L as the diagnostic chloride cutoff, 100% of CF cases were detected whether a minimum sweat weight of 75, 40, or 20 mg was required. 1) Collection of sweat from forearms is preferable to upper legs, particularly in very young infants; 2) sweat chloride concentrations are not highly dependent upon sweat rate; 3) a change in sweat chloride concentration exceeding 36% may be considered a clinically significant response to cystic fibrosis transmembrane receptor targeted therapy, and 4) sweat collections of less than 75 mg provide clinically accurate information.

Sweat chloride test is the gold standard test for cystic fibrosis (CF) diagnosis. Sweat conductivity is widely used although still considered a screening test. This was a prospective, cross-sectional, diagnostic research conducted at the laboratory of the Instituto da Criança of the Hospital das Clínicas, São Paulo, Brazil. Sweat chloride (quantitative pilocarpine iontophoresis) and sweat conductivity tests were simultaneously performed in patients referred for a sweat test between March 2007 and October 2008. Conductivity and chloride cut-off values used to rule out or diagnose CF were <75 and ≥90 mmol/L and <60 and ≥60 mmol/L, respectively. The ROC curve method was used to calculate the sensitivity, specificity, positive (PPV) and negative predictive value (NPV), as well as the respective 95% confidence intervals and to calculate the area under the curve for both tests. The kappa coefficient was used to evaluate agreement between the tests. Both tests were performed in 738 children, and CF was ruled out in 714 subjects; the median sweat chloride and conductivity values were 11 and 25 mmol/L in these populations, respectively. Twenty-four patients who had received a diagnosis of CF presented median sweat chloride and conductivity values of 87 and 103 mmol/L, respectively. Conductivity values above 90 mmol/L had 83.3% sensitivity, 99.7% specificity, 90.9% PPV and 99.4% NPV to diagnose CF. The best conductivity cut-off value to exclude CF was <75 mmol/L. Good agreement was observed between the tests (kappa: 0.934). The sweat conductivity test yielded a high degree of diagnostic accuracy and it showed good agreement with sweat chloride. We suggest that it should play a role as a diagnostic test for CF in the near future.

In cystic fibrosis (CF), sweat chloride concentration has been proposed as an index of CFTR function for testing systemic drugs designed to activate mutant CFTR. This suggestion arises from the assumption that greater residual CFTR function should lead to a lower sweat chloride concentration, as well as protection against severe lung disease. This logic gives rise to the hypothesis that the lower the sweat chloride concentration, the less severe the lung disease. In order to test this hypothesis, we studied 230 patients homozygous for the DeltaF508 allele, and 34 patients with at least one allele associated with pancreatic sufficiency, born since January 1, 1955, who have pulmonary function data and sweat chloride concentrations recorded in our CF center database, and no culture positive for B. cepacia. We calculated a severity index for pulmonary disease, using an approach which takes into account all available pulmonary function data as well as the patient's current age and survival status. Patients with alleles associated with pancreatic sufficiency had significantly better survival (P = 0.0083), lower sweat chloride concentration (81.4 +/- 23.8 vs. 103.2 +/- 14.2 mEq/l, P < 0.0001), slower rate of decline of FEV(1) % predicted (-0.75 +/- 0.34 vs. -2.34 +/- 0.17% predicted per year), and a better severity index than patients homozygous for the DeltaF508 allele (median 73rd percentile vs. median 55th percentile, P = 0.0004). However, the sweat chloride concentration did not correlate with the severity index, either in the population as a whole, or in the population of patients with alleles associated with pancreatic sufficiency, who are thought to have some residual CFTR function. These data suggest that, by itself, sweat chloride concentration does not necessarily predict a milder pulmonary course in patients with cystic fibrosis.

To conduct a descriptive analysis of the sweat test (ST), associating ST results with epidemiological data, <i>CFTR</i> (cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator) mutations and reasons to indicate the ST, as well as correlating sweat sodium and sweat chloride concentrations in subjects. Retrospective survey and descriptive analysis of 5,721 ST at a university referral center. The inclusion of the subjects was based on clinical data related with cystic fibrosis (CF) phenotype. The samples were grouped by (i) sweat chloride concentrations (mEq/L): <30: 3,249/5,277 (61.6%); ≥30 to <60: 1,326/5,277 (25.1%); ≥60: 702/5,277 (13.3%) and (ii) age: (Group A--GA) 0 to <6 months; (Group B--GB) ≥6 months to <18 years; (Group C--GC) ≥18 years. Digestive symptoms showed higher prevalence ratio for the CF diagnosis as well as association between younger age and higher values of sweat chloride, sweat sodium, and chloride/sodium ratio. The indication of ST due to respiratory symptoms was higher in GB and associated with greater age, lower values of sweat chloride, sweat sodium, and chloride/sodium ratio. There was higher prevalence of ST with sweat chloride levels <30 mEq/L in GB, ≥60 mEq/L in GC, and with borderline level in GB. There was positive correlation between sweat sodium and sweat chloride. Sweat chloride/sweat sodium and sweat sodium-sweat chloride indexes showed association with sex, reason for ST indication, and <i>CFTR</i> mutations. Sex alters some values presented in the ST. The number of ST/year performed before and after the newborn screening implementation was the same; however, we observed a higher number of borderlines values. A wide spectrum of <i>CFTR</i> mutation was found. Severe <i>CFTR</i> mutations and F508del/F508del genotype were associated with highest probability of ST chloride levels ≥60 mEq/L, and the absence of <i>CFTR</i> mutations identified was associated with borderline ST and respiratory symptoms. ST data showed wide variability dependent on age, sex, reason for examination indication, <i>CFTR</i> mutations, and weight of the collected sweat sample. Sweat sodium concentration is directly correlated with sweat chloride levels and it could be used as a quality parameter.

Cystic Fibrosis (CF) is an autosomal recessive disorder and the incidence of this disease is undermined in Northern India. The distinguishable salty character of the sweat belonging to individuals suffering from CF makes sweat chloride estimation essential for diagnosis of CF disease. The aim of this prospective study was to elucidate the relationship of sweat chloride levels with clinical features and pattern of CF. A total of 182 patients, with clinical features of CF were included in this study for quantitative measurement of sweat chloride. Sweat stimulation and collection involved pilocarpine iontophoresis based on the Gibson and Cooks methodology. The quantitative estimation of chloride was done by Schales and Schales method with some modifications. Cystic Fibrosis Trans Membrane Conductance Regulator (CFTR) mutation status was recorded in case of patients with borderline sweat chloride levels to correlate the results and for follow-up. Out of 182 patients having clinical features consistent with CF, borderline and elevated sweat chloride levels were present in 9 (5%) and 41 (22.5%) subjects respectively. Elevated sweat chloride levels were significantly associated with wheeze, Failure To Thrive (FTT), history of CF in Siblings, product of Consanguineous Marriage (CM), digital clubbing and steatorrhoea on univariate analysis. On multivariate analysis only wheeze, FTT and steatorrhoea were found to be significantly associated with elevated sweat chloride levels (p<0.05). Among the nine borderline cases six cases were positive for at least two CFTR mutations and rest of the three cases were not having any mutation in CFTR gene. The diagnosis is often delayed and the disease is advanced in most patients at the time of diagnosis. Sweat testing is a gold standard for diagnosis of CF patients as genetic mutation profile being heterozygous and unlikely to become diagnostic test.

Although the majority of cases of cystic fibrosis (CF) are now diagnosed through newborn screening, there is still a need to standardize the diagnostic criteria for those diagnosed outside of the neonatal period. This is because newborn screening started relatively recently, it is not performed everywhere, and even for individuals who were screened, there is the possibility of a false negative. To limit irreversible organ pathology, a timely diagnosis of CF and institution of CF therapies can greatly benefit these patients. Experts on CF diagnosis were convened at the 2015 CF Foundation Diagnosis Consensus Conference. The participants reviewed and discussed published works and instructive cases of CF diagnosis in individuals presenting with signs, symptoms, or a family history of CF. Through a modified Delphi methodology, several consensus statements were agreed upon. These consensus statements were updates of prior CF diagnosis conferences and recommendations. CF diagnosis in individuals outside of newborn screening relies on the clinical evidence and on evidence of CF transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) dysfunction. Clinical evidence can include typical organ pathologies seen in CF such as bronchiectasis or pancreatic insufficiency but often represent a broad range of severity including mild cases. CFTR dysfunction can be demonstrated using sweat chloride testing, CFTR molecular genetic analysis, or CFTR physiologic tests. On the basis of the large number of patients with bona fide CF currently followed in registries with sweat chloride levels between 30 and 40 mmol/L, the threshold considered "intermediate" was lowered from 40 mmol/L in the prior diagnostic guidelines to 30 mmol/L. The CF diagnosis was also discussed in the context of CFTR-related disorders in which CFTR dysfunction may be present, but the individual does not meet criteria for CF. CF diagnosis remains a rare but important condition that can be diagnosed when characteristic clinical features are seen in an individual with demonstrated CFTR dysfunction.

Recurrent airway infections are common in patients with Down's syndrome (DS). Hence, ruling out Cystic Fibrosis (CF) in these patients is often required. In the past, the value of sweat testing - the gold standard to diagnose CF - has been questioned in DS as false positive results have been reported. However, these reports are based on measurements of sweat osmolality or sodium concentrations, not chloride concentrations. This study analyses sweat secretion rate and chloride concentration in sweat samples of patients with DS in comparison to healthy controls. We assessed sweat samples in 16 patients with DS and 16 healthy controls regarding sweat secretion rate (SSR) and sweat chloride concentration. All measured chloride concentrations were within the normal range. The chloride concentrations were slightly, but not significantly lower in patients with DS (15,54 mmol/l (±4,47)) compared to healthy controls (18,31 mmol/l (±10,12)). While no gender gap in chloride concentration could be found, chloride concentration increased with age in both groups. Insufficient sweat was collected in 2 females with DS (12.5% of the study group) but not in an individual of the control group. A significant lower sweat secretion rate was found in the DS group (27,6 μl/30 min (± 12,18)) compared to the control group (42,7 μl/30 min (± 21,22)). In a sub-analysis, female patients produced significantly less sweat (20,8 ± 10,6 μl/30 min) than male patients with DS (36,4 ± 7,8 μl/30 min), which accounts for the difference between patients and controls. Furthermore, while the sweating secretion rate increased with age in the control group, it did not do so in the DS group. Once again this was due to female patients with DS, who did not show a significant increase of sweat secretion rate with age. Sweat chloride concentrations were within the normal range in patients with DS and therefore seem to be a reliable tool for testing for CF in these patients. Interestingly, we found a reduced sweat secretion rate in the DS group. Whether the last one has a functional and clinical counterpart, possibly due to a disturbed thermoregulation in DS patients, requires further investigation.
