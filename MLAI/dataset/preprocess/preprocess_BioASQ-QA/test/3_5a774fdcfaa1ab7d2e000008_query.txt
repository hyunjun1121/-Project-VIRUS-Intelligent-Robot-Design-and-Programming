Which protein is regulated by Tudor interacting repair regulator (TIRR)?

The tumor suppressor protein p53 and the human DNA topoisomerase I (htopoI) interact with each other, which leads to a stimulation of the catalytic activity of htopoI. Moreover, p53 stimulates the topoisomerase I-induced recombination repair (TIRR) reaction. However, little was known about how p53 stimulates this topoisomerase I activity. Here we demonstrate that monomeric p53 is sufficient for the stimulation of the topoisomerase I-catalyzed relaxation activity, but the tetrameric form of p53 is required for the stimulation of TIRR. We also show that p53 stimulates topoisomerase I activity by increasing the dissociation of htopoI from DNA. Since htopoI forms a closed ring structure around the DNA, our results suggest that p53 induces a conformational change within htopoI that results in an opening of the clamp, and thereby releases htopoI from DNA.

The 53BP1-dependent end-joining pathway plays a critical role in double strand break repair and is uniquely responsible for cellular sensitivity to poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase inhibitors (PARPi) in BRCA1-deficient cancers. We and others have investigated the downstream effectors of 53BP1, including replication timing regulatory factor 1 (RIF1) and Pax transactivation domain-interacting protein (PTIP), in the past few years to elucidate how loss of the 53BP1-dependent repair pathway results in PARPi resistance in BRCA1 patients. However, questions regarding the upstream regulation of the 53BP1 pathway remain unanswered. In this study, we identified the Tudor-interacting repair regulator (TIRR) that specifically associates with the ionizing radiation-induced foci formation region of 53BP1. 53BP1 and TIRR form a stable complex, which is required for their expression. Moreover, the 53BP1-TIRR complex dissociates after DNA damage, and this dissociation may be ataxia telangiectasia mutated-dependent. Similar to 53BP1, loss of TIRR restores PARPi resistance in BRCA1-deficient cells. Collectively, our data identified a novel 53BP1-TIRR complex in DNA damage response. TIRR may play both positive and negative roles in 53BP1 regulation. On the one hand, it stabilizes 53BP1 and thus positively regulates 53BP1. On the other hand, its association with 53BP1 prevents 53BP1 localization to sites of DNA damage, and thus TIRR is also an inhibitor of 53BP1.

P53-binding protein 1 (53BP1) is a multi-functional double-strand break repair protein that is essential for class switch recombination in B lymphocytes and for sensitizing BRCA1-deficient tumours to poly-ADP-ribose polymerase-1 (PARP) inhibitors. Central to all 53BP1 activities is its recruitment to double-strand breaks via the interaction of the tandem Tudor domain with dimethylated lysine 20 of histone H4 (H4K20me2). Here we identify an uncharacterized protein, Tudor interacting repair regulator (TIRR), that directly binds the tandem Tudor domain and masks its H4K20me2 binding motif. Upon DNA damage, the protein kinase ataxia-telangiectasia mutated (ATM) phosphorylates 53BP1 and recruits RAP1-interacting factor 1 (RIF1) to dissociate the 53BP1-TIRR complex. However, overexpression of TIRR impedes 53BP1 function by blocking its localization to double-strand breaks. Depletion of TIRR destabilizes 53BP1 in the nuclear-soluble fraction and alters the double-strand break-induced protein complex centring 53BP1. These findings identify TIRR as a new factor that influences double-strand break repair using a unique mechanism of masking the histone methyl-lysine binding function of 53BP1.
