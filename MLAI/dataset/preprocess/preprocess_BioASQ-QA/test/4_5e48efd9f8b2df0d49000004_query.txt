What is the aim of the "Radiogenomics Consortium"?

Nearly 50% of cancer patients undergo radiotherapy. Late radiotherapy toxicity affects quality-of-life in long-term cancer survivors and risk of side-effects in a minority limits doses prescribed to the majority of patients. Development of a test predicting risk of toxicity could benefit many cancer patients. We aimed to meta-analyze individual level data from four genome-wide association studies from prostate cancer radiotherapy cohorts including 1564 men to identify genetic markers of toxicity. Prospectively assessed two-year toxicity endpoints (urinary frequency, decreased urine stream, rectal bleeding, overall toxicity) and single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) associations were tested using multivariable regression, adjusting for clinical and patient-related risk factors. A fixed-effects meta-analysis identified two SNPs: rs17599026 on 5q31.2 with urinary frequency (odds ratio [OR] 3.12, 95% confidence interval [CI] 2.08-4.69, p-value 4.16×10(-8)) and rs7720298 on 5p15.2 with decreased urine stream (OR 2.71, 95% CI 1.90-3.86, p-value=3.21×10(-8)). These SNPs lie within genes that are expressed in tissues adversely affected by pelvic radiotherapy including bladder, kidney, rectum and small intestine. The results show that heterogeneous radiotherapy cohorts can be combined to identify new moderate-penetrance genetic variants associated with radiotherapy toxicity. The work provides a basis for larger collaborative efforts to identify enough variants for a future test involving polygenic risk profiling.

Radiobiology research is building the foundation for applying genomics in precision radiation oncology. Advances in high-throughput approaches will underpin increased understanding of radiosensitivity and the development of future predictive assays for clinical application. There is an established contribution of genetics as a risk factor for radiotherapy side effects. An individual's radiosensitivity is an inherited polygenic trait with an architecture that includes rare mutations in a few genes that confer large effects and common variants in many genes with small effects. Current thinking is that some will be tissue specific, and future tests will be tailored to the normal tissues at risk. The relationship between normal and tumor cell radiosensitivity is poorly understood. Data are emerging suggesting interplay between germline genetic variation and epigenetic modification with growing evidence that changes in DNA methylation regulate the radiosensitivity of cancer cells and histone acetyltransferase inhibitors have radiosensitizing effects. Changes in histone methylation can also impair DNA damage response signaling and alter radiosensitivity. An important effort to advance radiobiology in the genomic era was establishment of the Radiogenomics Consortium to enable the creation of the large radiotherapy cohorts required to exploit advances in genomics. To address challenges in harmonizing data from multiple cohorts, the consortium established the REQUITE project to collect standardized data and genotyping for ~5,000 patients. The collection of detailed dosimetric data is important to produce validated multivariable models. Continued efforts will identify new genes that impact on radiosensitivity to generate new knowledge on toxicity pathogenesis and tests to incorporate into the clinical decision-making process.

The optimal design and patient selection for interventional trials in radiogenomics seem trivial at first sight. However, radiogenomics do not give binary information like in e.g. targetable mutation biomarkers. Here, the risk to develop severe side effects is continuous, with increasing incidences of side effects with higher doses and/or volumes. In addition, a multi-SNP assay will produce a predicted probability of developing side effects and will require one or more cut-off thresholds for classifying risk into discrete categories. A classical biomarker trial design is therefore not optimal, whereas a risk factor stratification approach is more appropriate. Patient selection is crucial and this should be based on the dose-response relations for a specific endpoint. Alternatives to standard treatment should be available and this should take into account the preferences of patients. This will be discussed in detail.

The overall goal of radiogenomics is the identification of genomic markers that are predictive for the development of adverse effects resulting from cancer treatment with radiation. The principal rationale for a focus on toxicity in radiogenomics is that for many patients treated with radiation, especially individuals diagnosed with early-stage cancers, the survival rates are high, and therefore a substantial number of people will live for a significant period of time beyond treatment. However, many of these patients could suffer from debilitating complications resulting from radiotherapy. Work in radiogenomics has greatly benefited from creation of the Radiogenomics Consortium (RGC) that includes investigators at multiple institutions located in a variety of countries. The common goal of the RGC membership is to share biospecimens and data so as to achieve large-scale studies with increased statistical power to enable identification of relevant genomic markers. A major aim of research in radiogenomics is the development of a predictive instrument to enable identification of people who are at greatest risk for adverse effects resulting from cancer treatment using radiation. It is anticipated that creation of a predictive assay characterized by a high level of sensitivity and specificity will improve precision radiotherapy and assist patients and their physicians to select the optimal treatment for each individual.
