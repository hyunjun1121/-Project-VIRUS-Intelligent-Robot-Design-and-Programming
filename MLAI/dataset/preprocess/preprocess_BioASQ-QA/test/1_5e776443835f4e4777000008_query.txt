We evaluated the efficacy and tolerability of 3- and 6-month leuprorelin acetate (LA) depot formulations (Eligard®, Astellas Pharma GmbH) in patients with advanced prostate cancer treated in routine clinical practice in Germany. Data was pooled from 2 prospective, open-label, non-interventional studies in which 1,906 patients were treated for 12 months with either the 3-month (n = 633) or 6-month (n = 1,273) LA formulation. Median prostate-specific antigen levels in the pooled patient population declined from 12.0 ng/mL at baseline to 0.5 ng/mL after 12 months. Prostate-specific antigen reduction was achieved in treatment-naïve and pre-treated patients. Adverse events were documented in 8.8% of patients. These pooled data from routine clinical practice in Germany indicate that LA 3- and 6-month depot injections can effectively reduce prostate-specific antigen levels in a broad patient population with advanced prostate cancer.
