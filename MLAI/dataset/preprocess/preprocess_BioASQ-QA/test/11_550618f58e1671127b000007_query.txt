Inhibitor-1 becomes a potent inhibitor of protein phosphatase 1 when phosphorylated by cAMP-dependent protein kinase at Thr(35). Moreover, Ser(67) of inhibitor-1 serves as a substrate for cyclin-dependent kinase 5 in the brain. Here, we report that dephosphoinhibitor-1 but not phospho-Ser(67) inhibitor-1 was efficiently phosphorylated by protein kinase C at Ser(65) in vitro. In contrast, Ser(67) phosphorylation by cyclin-dependent kinase 5 was unaffected by phospho-Ser(65). Protein kinase C activation in striatal tissue resulted in the concomitant phosphorylation of inhibitor-1 at Ser(65) and Ser(67), but not Ser(65) alone. Selective pharmacological inhibition of protein phosphatase activity suggested that phospho-Ser(65) inhibitor-1 is dephosphorylated by protein phosphatase 1 in the striatum. In vitro studies confirmed these findings and suggested that phospho-Ser(67) protects phospho-Ser(65) inhibitor-1 from dephosphorylation by protein phosphatase 1 in vivo. Activation of group I metabotropic glutamate receptors resulted in the up-regulation of diphospho-Ser(65)/Ser(67) inhibitor-1 in this tissue. In contrast, the activation of N-methyl-d-aspartate-type ionotropic glutamate receptors opposed increases in striatal diphospho-Ser(65)/Ser(67) inhibitor-1 levels. Phosphomimetic mutation of Ser(65) and/or Ser(67) did not convert inhibitor-1 into a protein phosphatase 1 inhibitor. On the other hand, in vitro and in vivo studies suggested that diphospho-Ser(65)/Ser(67) inhibitor-1 is a poor substrate for cAMP-dependent protein kinase. These observations extend earlier studies regarding the function of phospho-Ser(67) and underscore the possibility that phosphorylation in this region of inhibitor-1 by multiple protein kinases may serve as an integrative signaling mechanism that governs the responsiveness of inhibitor-1 to cAMP-dependent protein kinase activation.

Inhibitor-1 (I-1) is a selective inhibitor of protein phosphatase-1 (PP1) and regulates several PP1-dependent signaling pathways, including cardiac contractility and regulation of learning and memory. The human I-1 gene has been spliced to generate two alternative mRNAs, termed I-1alpha and I-1beta, encoding polypeptides that differ from I-1 in their C-terminal sequences. Reverse transcription-PCR established that I-1alpha and I-1beta mRNAs are expressed in a developmental and tissue-specific manner. Functional analysis of I-1 in a Saccharomyces cerevisiae strain dependent on human I-1 for viability established that a novel domain encompassing amino acids 77-110 is necessary for PP1 inhibition in yeast. Expression of human I-1 in S. cerevisiae with a partial loss-of-function eukaryotic initiation factor-2alpha (eIF2alpha) kinase (Gcn2p) mutation permitted growth during amino acid starvation, consistent with the inhibition of Glc7p/PP1, the yeast eIF2alpha phosphatase. In contrast, human I-1alpha, which lacks amino acids 83-134, and I-1 with C-terminal deletions were significantly less effective in promoting yeast growth under starvation conditions. These data suggest that C-terminal sequences of I-1 enhance regulation of the eukaryotic eIF2alpha phosphatase. In vitro studies established that C-terminal sequences, deleted in both I-1alpha and I-1beta, enhance PP1 binding and inhibition. Expression of full-length and C-terminally truncated I-1 in HEK293T cells established the importance of the I-1 C terminus in transducing cAMP signals that promote eIF2alpha phosphorylation. This study demonstrates that multiple domains in I-1 target cellular PP1 complexes and establishes I-1 as a cellular regulator of eIF2alpha phosphorylation.

Transgenesis based on organ specific gene expression has provided the basis to elucidate the functional role of proteins for the past 15 years. Using this technology, we showed that inhibition of the protein phosphatase 1, by its constitutively active inhibitor-1, significantly increases cardiac contractility and calcium handling. To uncover protein changes accompanying the chronic increases in cardiac function of these transgenic hearts, we analyzed the cardiac proteome. Interestingly, we found significant increases in the levels of 6 proteins involved in metabolism, calcium binding and scavenging of oxido-reductive stress. These proteins were identified as: hydroxyacyl CoA dehydrogenase II, alpha subunit of the mitochondrial proton ATPase, peroxiredoxin 2, a novel EF-hand containing protein-2, annexin 5, and a previously uncharacterized cDNA. Thus, long-term cardiac specific overexpression of the protein phosphatase 1 inhibitor-1 and the associated increases in cardiac contractility appear to herald changes in a rather small number of proteins, which may reflect important compensatory adaptations in a hyperdynamic heart [corrected]

Aberrant beta-adrenergic signaling and depressed calcium homeostasis, associated with an imbalance of protein kinase A and phosphatase-1 activities, are hallmarks of heart failure. Phosphatase-1 is restrained by its endogenous inhibitor, protein phosphatase inhibitor-1 (PPI-1). We assessed 352 normal subjects, along with 959 patients with heart failure and identified a polymorphism in PPI-1 (G147D) exclusively in black subjects. To determine whether the G147D variant could affect cardiac function, we infected adult cardiomyocytes with adenoviruses expressing D147 or wild-type (G147) PPI-1. Under basal conditions, there were no significant differences in fractional shortening or contraction or relaxation rates. However, the enhancement of contractile parameters after isoproterenol stimulation was significantly blunted in D147 compared with G147 and control myocytes. Similar findings were observed in calcium kinetics. The attenuated beta-agonist response was associated with decreased (50%) phosphorylation of phospholamban (PLN) at serine 16, whereas phosphorylation of troponin I and ryanodine receptor was unaltered. These findings suggest that the human G147D PPI-1 can attenuate responses of cardiomyocytes to beta-adrenergic agonists by decreasing PLN phosphorylation and therefore may contribute to deteriorated function in heart failure.

The major spontaneously active serine/threonine (Ser/Thr) protein phosphatase activities in N. crassa wild type (FGSC 424) were type-1 (PP1), type-2A (PP2A) and type-2C (PP2C). PP1 and PP2C predominantly dephosphorylated phosphorylase a and casein, respectively. PP2A acted on both substrates, but was two-fold more active against casein. PP1 activity was inhibited by protamine, heparin, okadaic acid (IC50 50 nM) and mammalian inhibitor-1 (IC50 2 nM). On the other hand. PP2A activity was inhibited by much lower concentrations of okadaic acid (IC50 0.2 nM) and also by protamine, but not by heparin or inhibitor-1. About 80% of total PP1 activity was associated with the particulate fraction and could be partially extracted with 0.5 M NaCl. Seventy and ninety percent of PP2A and PP2C activities, respectively, were found in the soluble fraction. In addition we have partially purified an acid and thermostable PP1 inhibitor which effectively inhibits both N. crassa and mammalian PP1.

Cardiac sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR) Ca(2+) ATPase (SERCA2a) promotes Ca(2+) uptake in the SR. Dephosphorylated phospholamban (PLB) inhibits SERCA2a activity. We found a distinct dephosphorylation of PLB at Thr(17) and Ser(16) after 20-30min of ischemia produced by coronary artery occlusion in rats. The aim of the study was to investigate how PLB is dephosphorylated in ischemia and to determine whether PLB dephosphorylation causes myocardial hypercontraction and calpain activation through Ca(2+) overload in reperfusion. Protein inhibitor-1 (I-1) specifically inhibits protein phosphatase 1 (PP1), the predominant PLB phosphatase in heart. A Ca(2+)-dependent phosphatase calcineurin may also induce PLB dephosphorylation. Ischemia for 30min induced PKC-α translocation, resulting in inactivation of I-1 through PKC-α-dependent phosphorylation at Ser(67). The PP1 activation following I-1 inactivation was thought to induce PLB dephosphorylation in ischemia. Ischemia for 30min activated calcineurin, and pre-treatment with a calcineurin inhibitor, cyclosporine A (CsA), inhibited PKC-α translocation, I-1 phosphorylation at Ser(67), and PLB dephosphorylation in ischemia. Reperfusion for 5min following 30min of ischemia induced spreading of contraction bands (CBs) and proteolysis of fodrin by calpain. Both CsA and an anti-PLB antibody that inhibits binding of PLB to SERCA2a reduced the CB area and fodrin breakdown after reperfusion. These results reveal a novel pathway via which ischemia induces calcineurin-dependent activation of PKC-α, inactivation of I-1 through PKC-α-dependent phosphorylation at Ser(67), and PP1-dependent PLB dephosphorylation. The pathway contributes to the spreading of CBs and calpain activation through Ca(2+) overload in early reperfusion.

The cDNA encoding human brain protein phosphatase inhibitor-1 (I-1) was expressed in Escherichia coli. Following PKA phosphorylation at a threonine, recombinant human I-1 was indistinguishable from rabbit skeletal muscle I-1 as a potent and specific inhibitor of the type-1 protein serine/threonine phosphatase (PP1). N-Terminal phosphopeptides of I-1 that retained the selectivity of intact human I-1 highlighted a functional domain that mediates PP1 inhibition. Substituting alanine in place of threonine-36 eliminated I-1 phosphorylation by PKA and its phosphatase inhibitor activity. An acidic residue was substituted in place of the phosphoacceptor to produce I-1(T35D), a constitutive phosphate inhibitor. I-1(T35D) was an equally effective inhibitor of PP1 and the type-2 phosphatase, PP2A. However, CNbr digestion of I-1(T35D) yielded an N-terminal peptide that showed 100-fold increased specificity as a PP1 inhibitor. This provided new insight into a unique conformation of the phosphorylated I-1 that accounts for selective inhibition of PP1 activity. Truncation of an active I-1 phosphopeptide identified an N-terminal sequence that was reduced in addition to threonine-35 phosphorylation to inhibit PP1 activity. Biosensor studies demonstrated that PP1 bound to both Phosphorylated and dephosphorylated I-1 and suggested that distinct elements of I-1 structure accounted for PP1 binding and inhibition. Our data point to multiple interactions between the I-1 functional domain. and the PP1 catalytic subunit that define this phosphoprotein as a physiological regulator of the type-1 protein phosphatase.

Inhibitor 1 (I-1) is a protein inhibitor of protein phosphatase 1 (PP1), the predominating Ser/Thr phosphatase in the heart. Non-phosphorylated I-1 is inactive, whereas I-1 phosphorylated by protein kinase A (PKA) at Thr35 is a potent PP1 inhibitor. The phosphatases that dephosphorylate I-1Thr35 and thus deactivate I-1 in the heart are not established. Here we overexpressed I-1 in neonatal rat cardiac myocytes with recombinant adenovirus and determined phosphorylation of I-1, and one of the major target proteins of PKA/PP1 in the heart, phospholamban (PLB), by Western blot with phospho-specific antibodies. Incubation with the calcineurin inhibitor cyclosporine A or okadaic acid, used at a concentration preferentially inhibiting phosphatase 2A (PP2A), increased significantly I-1Thr35 (approximately 2- to 6-fold) and PLB Ser16 phosphorylation (approximately 2-fold). The results indicate that calcineurin and PP2A act to maintain a low basal level of phosphorylated (active) I-1 in living cardiac myocytes. Calcineurin may constitute a cross-talk between calcium- and cAMP-dependent pathways.

Protein phosphatase inhibitor-1 was purified from bovine adipose tissue. The protein had an apparent molecular mass of 32 kDa by SDS/PAGE and a Stokes' radius of 3.4 nm. It was phosphorylated by cAMP-dependent protein kinase on a threonyl residue; this phosphorylation was necessary for inhibition of protein phosphatase-1. Bovine adipose tissue inhibitor-1 was compared directly with rabbit skeletal muscle inhibitor-1 and with a 32000-Mr, dopamine- and cAMP-regulated phosphoprotein from bovine brain (DARPP-32), also an inhibitor of protein phosphatase-1. By the following biochemical and immunochemical criteria, bovine adipose tissue inhibitor-1 was found to be very similar and possibly identical to DARPP-32 and was clearly distinct from skeletal muscle inhibitor-1: molecular mass by SDS/PAGE; Stokes' radii; phosphorylation on threonine residues; Staphylococcus-aureus-V8-protease-generated peptide patterns analyzed by SDS/PAGE; tryptic phosphopeptide maps analysed by two-dimensional thin-layer electrophoresis/chromatography; elution on reverse-phase HPLC; chymotryptic peptide maps as analysed by reverse-phase HPLC; amino acid composition; antibody recognition by immunoprecipitation and immunoblotting; effect of cyanogen bromide cleavage on protein phosphatase inhibitor activity. Based on these results we conclude that bovine brain and adipose tissue contain an identical phosphoprotein inhibitor of protein phosphatase-1 (DARPP-32), which is distinct from that of skeletal muscle (inhibitor-1).

The type 1 protein phosphatase (PP1) is a critical negative regulator of Ca(2+) cycling and contractility in the cardiomyocyte. In particular, it mediates restoration of cardiac function to basal levels, after beta-adrenergic stimulation, by dephosphorylating key phospho-proteins. PP1 is a holoenzyme comprised of its catalytic and auxiliary subunits. These regulatory proteins dictate PP1's subcellular localization, substrate specificity and activity. Amongst them, inhibitor-1 is of particular importance since it has been implicated as an integrator of multiple neurohormonal pathways, which finely regulate PP1 activity, at the level of the sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR). In fact, perturbations in the regulation of PP1 by inhibitor-1 have been implicated in the pathogenesis of heart failure, suggesting that inhibitor-1-based therapeutic interventions may ameliorate cardiac dysfunction and remodeling in the failing heart. This review will discuss the current views on the role of inhibitor-1 in cardiac physiology, its possible contribution to cardiac disease and its potential as a novel therapeutic strategy.

Inhibitor 1 (I-1) is a protein inhibitor of protein phosphatase 1 (PP1), a major eukaryotic Ser/Thr phosphatase. Nonphosphorylated I-1 is inactive, whereas phosphorylated I-1 is a potent PP1 inhibitor. I-1 is phosphorylated in vivo on Thr(35) and Ser(67). Thr(35) is phosphorylated by cAMP-dependent protein kinase (A kinase), and Thr(35)-phosphorylated I-1 inhibits PP1. Until now the kinase that phosphorylates Ser(67) had not been identified and the physiological role of Ser(67) phosphorylation was unknown. In this study we detected a high level of kinase activity in brain extract when a glutathione S-transferase (GST) fusion I-1 mutant containing an Ala substituted for Thr(35) [GST-I-1(T35A)] was used as the substrate. GST-I-1(T35A) kinase and neuronal cdc2-like protein kinase (NCLK) in the brain extract could not be separated from each other by a series of sequential chromatographies. GST-I-1(T35A) kinase immunoprecipitated with anti-NCLK antibody from kinase-active column fractions. Purified NCLK-phosphorylated GST-I-1(T35A) and I-1 (0.7 mole of phosphate per mole of I-1). HPLC phosphopeptide mapping, amino acid sequencing, and site-directed mutagenesis determined that NCLK phosphorylates Ser(67) of I-1. NCLK-phosphorylated I-1 and I-1(T35A) inhibited PP1 with IC(50) values approximately 9.5 and 13. 8 nM, respectively. When compared, A kinase-phosphorylated I-1 was only approximately 1.2 times more inhibitory than NCLK-phosphorylated I-1. Our data indicate that NCLK is a potential in vivo I-1 kinase and that Thr(35) and Ser(67) phosphorylation independently activate I-1.
