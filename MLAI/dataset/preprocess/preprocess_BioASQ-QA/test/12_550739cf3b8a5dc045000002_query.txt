The black tiger shrimp (Penaeus monodon) is economically important in many parts of the world, including Thailand. Shrimp immunity is similar to that of other invertebrate organisms; it consists of an innate immunity system. Toll or Toll-like receptors (TLRs) play an essential role in recognizing the cleaved form of the cytokine Sp√§tzle, which is processed by a series of proteolytic cascades activated by secreted recognition molecules. We isolated a full-length Toll receptor from P. monodon. The cloned full-length sequence of the PmToll cDNA consists of 4144 nucleotides, containing a 5'-UTR with 366 nucleotides, a 3'-terminal UTR with 985 nucleotides, with a classical polyadenylation signal sequence AATAAA, a poly A-tail with 27 nucleotides, and an open reading frame coding for 931 amino acids. The deduced amino acid sequence of PmToll is a typical type I membrane domain protein, characteristic of TLR functional domains. It includes a putative signal peptide, an extracellular domain consisting of leucine-rich repeats, flanked by cysteine-rich motifs, a single-pass transmembrane portion, and a cytoplasmic TLR domain. PmToll was expressed in all tissues tested, including gill, hemocytes, heart, hepatopancreas, lymphoid organs, muscle, nerve, pleopod, stomach, testis, and ovary. The deduced amino acid of PmToll is closely related to that of other shrimp Tolls, especially FcToll. Further studies elucidating the mechanism of action of Tolls will be of benefit for understanding the defense mechanisms of this economically important aquatic species.

We characterized thioredoxin reductase 1 (TrxR1) from Chironomus riparius (CrTrxR1) and studied its expression under oxidative stress. The full-length cDNA is 1820bp long and contains an open reading frame (ORF) of 1488bp. The deduced CrTrxR1 protein has 495 amino acids and a calculated molecular mass of 54.41kDa and an isoelectric point of 6.15. There was a 71bp 5' and a 261bp 3' untranslated region with a polyadenylation signal site (AATAAA). Homologous alignments showed the presence of conserved catalytic domain Cys-Val-Asn-Val-Gly-Cys (CVNVGC), the C-terminal amino acids 'CCS' and conserved amino acids required in catalysis. The expression of CrTrxR1 is measured using quantitative real-time PCR after exposure to 50 and 100mg/L of paraquat (PQ) and 2, 10 and 20mg/L of cadmium chloride (Cd). CrTrxR1 mRNA was upregulated after PQ exposure at all conditions tested. The highest level of CrTrxR1 expression was observed after exposure to 10mg/L of Cd for 24h followed by 20mg/L for 48h. Significant downregulation of CrTrxR1 was observed after exposure to 10 and 20mg/L of Cd for 72h. This study shows that the CrTrxR1 could be potentially used as a biomarker of oxidative stress inducing environmental contaminants.

Revolver is a newly discovered multi-gene family of transposable elements in the Triticeae genome. Revolver encompasses 2929 to 3041 bp, has 20 bp of terminal inverted repeated sequences at both ends, and contains a transcriptionally active gene encoding a DNA-binding-like protein. A putative TATA box is located at base 221, with a cap site at base 261 and a possible polyadenylation signal AATAAA at base 2918. Revolver shows considerable quantitative variation in wheat and its relatives. Revolver cDNAs varied between 395 and 2,182 bp in length. The first exon exhibited length variation, but the second and third exons were almost identical. These variants in the Revolver family shared the downstream region of the second intron, but varied structurally at the 5' first exon. There were 58 clones, which showed partial homology to Revolver, among 440,000 expressed sequence tagged (EST) clones sourced from Triticeae. In these Revolver homologues with lengths of 360-744 bp, the portion after the 2nd exon was conserved (65-79% homology), but the 1st exon sequences had mutually low homology, with mutations classified into 12 types, and did not have EST sequences with open reading frames (ORFs). By PCR with the 3'-flanking region of a typical genomic clone of Revolver-2 used as a single primer, rye chromosomes 1R and 5R could be simultaneously identified. Extensive eco-geographic diversity and divergence was observed among 161 genotypes of the single species Triticum dicoccoides collected from 18 populations in Israel with varying exposures to abiotic and biotic stresses (soil, temperature, altitude, water availability, and pathogens). On the base of existing differences between Revolver variants, the molecular markers that can distinguish different rye chromosomes were developed. Eco-geographic diversification of wild emmer T. dicoccoides in Israel and high Revolver copy numbers are associated with higher rainfall and biotic stresses. The remarkable quantitative differences among copy numbers of Revolver in the same species from different ecosystems suggest strong amplification activity within the last 10,000 years. It is the interesting finding because the majority of Triticeae high-copy transposable elements seem to be inactive at the recent time except for BARE-1 element in Hordeum and the fact might be interesting to perceive the processes of plant adaptive evolution.

Polyadenylation of pre-mRNAs, a critical step in eukaryotic gene expression, is mediated by cis elements collectively called the polyadenylation signal. Genome-wide analysis of such polyadenylation signals was missing in fission yeast, even though it is an important model organism. We demonstrate that the canonical AATAAA motif is the most frequent and functional polyadenylation signal in Schizosaccharomyces pombe. Using analysis of RNA-Seq data sets from cells grown under various physiological conditions, we identify 3' UTRs for nearly 90% of the yeast genes. Heterogeneity of cleavage sites is common, as is alternative polyadenylation within and between conditions. We validated the computationally identified sequence elements likely to promote polyadenylation by functional assays, including qRT-PCR and 3'RACE analysis. The biological importance of the AATAAA motif is underlined by functional analysis of the genes containing it. Furthermore, it has been shown that convergent genes require trans elements, like cohesin for efficient transcription termination. Here we show that convergent genes lacking cohesin (on chromosome 2) are generally associated with longer overlapping mRNA transcripts. Our bioinformatic and experimental genome-wide results are summarized and can be accessed and customized in a user-friendly database Pomb(A).

Sox genes share a highly conserved DNA-binding motif, the HMG (high mobility group)-box domain, and have diverse roles in vertebrate embryonic development. A novel SRY-related cDNA (temporarily called Sox33) isolated from the Chinese alligator (Alligator sinensis) is 1,819 bp in length, with an open reading frame from 220 to 1113 bp, encoding a protein of 298 amino acids. Two putative polyadenylation signal sequences (AATAAA) are present upstream of the poly(A) tail in the 3' UTR (at 1255-1260 and 1774-1779). The putative protein contains an HMG-box domain most closely related to hSox12, mSox4, rtSox11, and mSox11 homologs, indicating that alligator Sox33 belongs to group C in the Sox gene family. Alligator adult and developing tissues were tested for Sox33 mRNA by independent Northern blots using a 336-bp probe (at 907-1243) between the HMG-box and the poly(A) site I and a 277-bp probe (at 1477-1754) between the two polyadenylation sites. Two transcripts (1.3 kb and 1.8 kb) in developing brain and one (1.8 kb) in adult brain were identified by the 336-bp probe; only one transcript (1.8 kb) in developing and adult brains was detected by the 277-bp probe. The results suggest that alligator Sox33 may use a different polyadenylation mechanism in the developing brain and play a role in the development and maintenance of the nervous system.

Proteinase inhibitors play important roles in host defence systems involving blood coagulation and pathogen digestion. We isolated and characterized a cDNA clone for a Kazal-type proteinase inhibitor (KPI) from a hemocyte cDNA library of the oriental white shrimp Fenneropenaeus chinensis. The KPI gene consists of three exons and two introns. KPI cDNA contains an open reading frame of 396 bp, a polyadenylation signal sequence AATAAA, and a poly (A) tail. KPI cDNA encodes a polypeptide of 131 amino acids with a putative signal peptide of 21 amino acids. The deduced amino acid sequence of KPI contains two homologous Kazal domains, each with six conserved cysteine residues. The mRNA of KPI is expressed in the hemocytes of healthy shrimp, and the higher expression of KPI transcript is observed in shrimp infected with the white spot syndrome virus (WSSV), suggesting a potential role for KPI in host defence mechanisms.

Poly(A) tails of mRNAs are synthesized in the cell nucleus with a defined length, approximately 250 nucleotides in mammalian cells. The same type of length control is seen in an in vitro polyadenylation system reconstituted from three proteins: poly(A) polymerase, cleavage and polyadenylation specificity factor (CPSF), and the nuclear poly(A)-binding protein (PABPN1). CPSF, binding the polyadenylation signal AAUAAA, and PABPN1, binding the growing poly(A) tail, cooperatively stimulate poly(A) polymerase such that a complete poly(A) tail is synthesized in one processive event, which terminates at a length of approximately 250 nucleotides. We report that PABPN1 is required to restrict CPSF binding to the AAUAAA sequence and to permit the stimulation of poly(A) polymerase by AAUAAA-bound CPSF to be maintained throughout the elongation reaction. The stimulation by CPSF is disrupted when the poly(A) tail has reached a length of approximately 250 nucleotides, and this terminates processive elongation. PABPN1 measures the length of the tail and is responsible for disrupting the CPSF-poly(A) polymerase interaction.

We identified and characterized a CYP9 family gene, CrCYP9AT2, from Chironomus riparius, an eco-toxicologically important model organism. The 1978 base pair (bp) length CrCYP9AT2 cDNA has an open reading frame of 1587 bp encoding a putative 528 amino acid protein. There was 267 bp 5' and 123 bp 3' untranslated region with a polyadenylation signal site (AATAAA). The putative heme-binding cysteine at position 471 and the typical p450 signature sequence of 463-FGIGPRNCIG-473 were also present. The CrCYP9AT2 transcript was present in all life stages with the highest expression in larvae. The modulation of CrCYP9AT2 was studied using real-time polymerase chain reaction after 24h exposure to cadmium chloride, benzo(a)pyrene; bisphenol A; nonylphenol; chlorpyrifos and ethinylestradiol. Significant up-regulation of CrCYP9AT2 gene was observed after exposure to Cd, B(a)P and CP. However, CrCYP9AT2 was significantly down-regulated after exposure to BPA, NP and EE.

SV40 PolyA (Simian virus 40 PolyA, also called PolyA) sequence is DNA sequence (240 bp) that possesses the activity of transcription termination and can add PolyA tail to mRNA. PolyA contains AATAAA hexanucleotide polyadenylation signal. Fourteen copies of Alu in sense orientation (Alu14) were inserted downstream of GFP in pEGFP-C1 to construct pAlu14 plasmid, and then HeLa cells were transiently transfected with pAlu14. Northern blot and fluorescence microscope were used to observe GFP RNA and protein expressions. Our results found that Alu tandem sequence inhibited remarkably GFP gene expression, but produced higher-molecular-mass GFP fusion RNA. PolyA and its sequence that was deleted AATAAA signal in sense or antisense orientation were inserted between GFP and Alu tandem sequence in pAlu14. The results showed that all the inserted PolyA sequences partly eliminated the inhibition induced by Alu14. PolyA sequences without AATAAA signal in sense or antisense orientation still induced transcription termination. Antisense PolyA (PolyAas) was divided into four fragments that all are 60 bp long and the middle two fragments were named 2F2R and 3F3R. 2F2R or 3F3R was inserted upstream of Alu tandem sequence in pAlu14. The molecular mass of GFP fusion RNA increased when the copy number of 2F2R increased. 2F2R can support transcription elongation when 2F2R is located upstream of other 2F2R. Nevertheless, 2F2R located upstream of Alu tandem sequence can induce transcription termination. Inserting one copy or 64 copies of 3F3R in upstream of Alu tandem sequence caused the production of lower-molecular-mass GFP RNA.

A large-scale analysis of human polyadenylation signals was carried out in silico. The most canonical AAUAAA hexamer and its 11 single-nucleotide variants that are most frequent in human genes were used to search for polyadenylation signals in the terminal sequences. Out of 18,277 poly(A) sites that were identified from 26,414 human genes, 82.5% of the sites were found to contain at least one of these 12 hexamers as a polyadenylation signal within 40 nucleotides upstream of the poly(A) site. The rest (17.5%) did not contain any of these hexamers, which suggests the existence of yet unknown signals. A total of 20,347 terminal sequences in close proximity to 12 polyadenylation signals were collected using modified EST clustering technique to establish a large-scale database of polyadenylation signals. To characterize the 12 hexamers, the locations of polyadenylation signals that were identified as "authentic" and the uracil contents of the downstream region of the signal were examined. Based on this analysis, the 11 variants of the canonical AAUAAA were identified as possibly forming "functional" signals as AAUAAA. Moreover, the observed frequency of 41.9% for AAUAAA was significantly lower than those of other reports, suggesting that the non-canonical variants are more important in the polyadenylation process than frequently recognized. Since the poly(A) sites processed by those non-canonical variants have not been generally annotated in major gene databases, it is important to determine whether the variant hexamers could work as polyadenylation signals that may be responsible for generating heterogeneity of mRNAs by alternative polyadenylation.

Polyadenylation (poly(A)) of eukaryotic mRNA is a critical step for gene expression. In plants, poly(A) signals leading to the formation of polyadenosine tails after mRNAs include the far upstream elements, the AAUAAA-like signals, and the mRNA cleavage sites for poly(A). Multiple AAUAAA signals leading to alternative polyadenosine formation have been found in many genes, but the effects of each AAUAAA signal on gene expression remain to be uncovered. A DNA fragment, whose transcript contains two canonical AAUAAA signals from the 3'-untranslation region of endochitinase gene of tobacco (Nicotiana tabacum L. cv. W38), was mutated and constructed into the downstream of beta-glucuronidase (GUS) coding region. Transient expression of GUS gene from these constructs indicated that the distal AAUAAA signal from the stop codon was more important than the proximal one in stimulating gene expression. Also, the sequence rather than the distance between the stop codon and the AAUAAA signal region was critical for gene expression. Transgenic tobaccos with these constructs were also generated, and the position of the polyadenosine tail formation in this region was mapped. Results revealed that both AAUAAA signals were functional, and that polyadenosine tails of most transcripts were directed by the distal AAUAAA signal. Finally, the RNA stabilities of these variants in transgenic plants were measured. RNAs from the variants with the functional distal AAUAAA signal were more stable than those with the functional proximal one only. The possible secondary structure in this poly(A) signal region was predicted and discussed.

It is well known that nearly all eukaryotic mRNAs contain a 3' poly(A) tail. A polyadenylation signal (AAUAAA) nearby the 3' end of pre-mRNA is required for poly(A) synthesis. The protein complex involved in the pre-mRNA polyadenylation is coupled with RNA polymerase II during the transcription of a gene. According to the commonly accepted view, only RNAs synthesized by RNA polymerase II can be polyadenylated in an AAUAAA-dependent manner. Here we report the polyadenylation of short interspersed elements (SINEs) B2 and VES transcripts generated by RNA polymerase III. HeLa cells were transfected with SINE constructs with or without polyadenylation signals. The analyses of the SINE transcripts showed that only the RNAs with the AAUAAA-signal contained poly(A) tails. Polyadenylated B2 RNA was found to be much more stable in cells than B2 RNA without a poly(A) tail.
