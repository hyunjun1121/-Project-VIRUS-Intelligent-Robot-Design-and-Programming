What is the function of the protein encoded by the gene NKCC2?

Expression of Tamm-Horsfall protein (THP or uromodulin) is highly restricted to the kidney thick ascending limb (TAL) of loop of Henle. Despite the unique location and recent association of THP gene mutations with hereditary uromodulin-associated kidney disease and THP single nucleotide polymorphisms with chronic kidney disease and hypertension, the physiological function(s) of THP and its pathological involvement remain incompletely understood. By studying age-dependent changes of THP knockout (KO) mice, we show here that young KO mice had significant salt and water wasting but were partially responsive to furosemide, due to decreased luminal translocation of Na-K-Cl cotransporter 2 (NKCC2) in the TAL. Aged THP KO mice were, however, markedly oliguric and unresponsive to furosemide, and their NKCC2 was localized primarily in the cytoplasm as evidenced by lipid raft floatation assay, cell fractionation, and confocal and immunoelectron microscopy. These aged KO mice responded to metolazone and acetazolamide, known to target distal and proximal tubules, respectively. They also had marked upregulation of renin in juxtaglomerular apparatus and serum, and they were hypertensive. Finally, the aged THP KO mice had significant upregulation of Na-coupled urate transporters Slc5a8 and Slc22a12 as well as sodium-hydrogen exchanger 3 (NHE3) in the proximal tubule and elevated serum uric acid and allantoin. Collectively, our results suggest that THP deficiency can cause progressive disturbances in renal functions via initially NKCC2 dysfunction and later compensatory responses, resulting in prolonged activation of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone axis and hyperuricemia.

AAV9 vector provides efficient gene transfer in all segments of the renal nephron, with minimum expression in non-renal cells, when administered retrogradely via the ureter. It is important to restrict the transgene expression to the desired cell type within the kidney, so that the physiological endpoints represent the function of the transgene expressed in that specific cell type within kidney. We hypothesized that segment-specific gene expression within the kidney can be accomplished using the highly efficient AAV9 vectors carrying the promoters of genes that are expressed exclusively in the desired segment of the nephron in combination with administration by retrograde infusion into the kidney via the ureter. We constructed AAV vectors carrying eGFP under the control of: kidney-specific cadherin (KSPC) gene promoter for expression in the entire nephron; Na<sup>+</sup>/glucose co-transporter (SGLT2) gene promoter for expression in the S1 and S2 segments of the proximal tubule; sodium, potassium, 2 chloride co-transporter (NKCC2) gene promoter for expression in the thick ascending limb of Henle's loop (TALH); E-cadherin (ECAD) gene promoter for expression in the collecting duct (CD); and cytomegalovirus (CMV) early promoter that provides expression in most of the mammalian cells, as control. We tested the specificity of the promoter constructs in vitro for cell type-specific expression in mouse kidney cells in primary culture, followed by retrograde infusion of the AAV vectors via the ureter in the mouse. Our data show that AAV9 vector, in combination with the segment-specific promoters administered by retrograde infusion via the ureter, provides renal nephron segment-specific gene expression.

With no lysine kinase 4 (WNK4) is essential to activate the thiazide-sensitive NaCl cotransporter (NCC) along the distal convoluted tubule, an effect central to the phenotype of familial hyperkalemic hypertension. Although effects on potassium and sodium channels along the connecting and collecting tubules have also been documented, WNK4 is typically believed to have little role in modulating sodium chloride reabsorption along the thick ascending limb of the loop of Henle. Yet wnk4<sup>-/-</sup> mice (knockout mice lacking WNK4) do not demonstrate the hypocalciuria typical of pure distal convoluted tubule dysfunction. Here, we tested the hypothesis that WNK4 also modulates bumetanide-sensitive Na-K-2Cl cotransporter (NKCC2) function along the thick ascending limb. We confirmed that w nk4<sup>-/-</sup> mice are hypokalemic and waste sodium chloride, but are also normocalciuric. Results from Western blots suggested that the phosphorylated forms of both NCC and NKCC2 were in lower abundance in wnk4<sup>-/-</sup> mice than in controls. This finding was confirmed by immunofluorescence microscopy. Although the initial response to furosemide was similar in wnk4<sup>-/-</sup> mice and controls, the response was lower in the knockout mice when reabsorption along the distal convoluted tubule was inhibited. Using HEK293 cells, we showed that WNK4 increases the abundance of phosphorylated NKCC2. More supporting evidence that WNK4 may modulate NKCC2 emerges from a mouse model of WNK4-mediated familial hyperkalemic hypertension in which more phosphorylated NKCC2 is present than in controls. These data indicate that WNK4, in addition to modulating NCC, also modulates NKCC2, contributing to its physiological function in vivo.

Rare variants, in particular renal salt handling genes, contribute to monogenic forms of hypertension and hypotension syndromes with electrolyte abnormalities. A study by Ji et al (2008) demonstrated this effect for rare loss-of-function coding variants in SLC12A3 (NCCT), SLC12A1 (NKCC2), and KCNJ1 (ROMK) that led to reduction of ∼6 mm Hg for SBP and ∼3 mm Hg for DBP among carriers in 2492 European ancestry Framingham Heart Study (FHS) subjects. These findings support a potentially large role for these variants in interindividual variation in systolic and diastolic blood pressure (SBP, DBP) in the population. The present study focuses on replicating the analyses completed by Ji et al to identify effects of rare variants in the population-based Atherosclerosis Risk in Communities (ARIC) study.We attempted to replicate the findings by Ji et al by applying their criteria to identify putative loss-of-function variants with allele frequency <0.001 and complete conservation across a set of orthologs, to exome sequencing data from 7444 European ancestry participants of the ARIC study.Although we failed to replicate the previous findings when applying their methods to the ARIC study data, we observed a similar effect when we restricted analyses to the subset of variants they observed.These results simultaneously support the utility of exome sequencing data for studying extremely rare coding variants in hypertension and underscore the need for improved filtering methods for identifying functional variants in human sequences.
