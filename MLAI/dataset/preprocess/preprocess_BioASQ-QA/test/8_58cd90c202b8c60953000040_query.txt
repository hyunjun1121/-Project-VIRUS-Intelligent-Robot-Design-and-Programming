Lung cancer is the leading cause of cancer death, and it is widely accepted that chronic inflammation is an important risk for the development of lung cancer. Now, it is recognized that the nucleotide-binding and oligomerization domain (NOD) like receptors (NLRs)-containing inflammasomes are involved in cancer-related inflammation. This study was designed to investigate the effects of NLR family pyrin domain containing protein 3 (NLRP3) inflammasome on the proliferation and migration of lung adenocarcinoma cell line A549. Using 5-ethynyl-2'-deoxyuridine (EdU) incorporation assay, scratch assay, and Transwell migration assay, we showed that activation of the NLRP3 inflammasome by LPS+ATP enhanced the proliferation and migration of A549 cells. Western blot analysis showed that activation of phosphorylation of Akt, ERK1/2, CREB and the expression of Snail increased, while the expression of E-cadherin decreased after the activation of NLRP3 inflammasome. Moreover, these effects were inhibited by the following treatments: i) downregulating the expression of NLRP3 by short hairpin RNA (shRNA) interference, ii) inhibiting the activation of NLRP3 inflammasome with a caspase-1 inhibitor, iii) blocking the interleukin-1β (IL-1β) and IL-18 signal transduction with IL-1 receptor antagonist (IL-1Ra) and IL-18 binding protein (IL-18BP). Collectively, these results indicate that NLRP3 inflammasome plays a vital role in regulating the proliferation and migration of A549 cells and it might be a potential target for the treatment of lung cancer.

IL-18 is a pleiotropic and multifunctional cytokine that belongs to the IL-1 family. It is produced as a biologically inactive precursor, which is cleaved into its active mature form mainly by caspase-1. The caspase becomes active from its inactive precursor (procaspase-1) upon assembly of an inflammasome. Because of IL-18's potential pro-inflammatory and tissue destructive effects, its biological activities are tightly controlled in the body by its naturally occurring antagonist called IL-18BP. The antagonist is produced in the body both constitutively and in response to an increased production of IL-18 as a negative feedback mechanism. Under physiological conditions, most of IL-18 in the circulation is bound with IL-18BP and is inactive. However, an imbalance in the production of IL-18 and its antagonist (an increase in the production of IL-18 with a decrease, no increase or an insufficient increase in the production of IL-18BP) has been described in many chronic inflammatory diseases in humans. The imbalance results in an increase in the concentrations of free IL-18 (unbound with its antagonist) resulting in increased biological activities of the cytokine that contribute towards pathogenesis of the disease. In this article, we provide an overview of the current biology of IL-18 and its antagonist, discuss how the imbalance occurs in HIV infections and how it contributes towards development of AIDS and other non-AIDS-associated clinical conditions occurring in HIV-infected individuals undergoing combination anti-retroviral therapy (cART). Finally, we discuss challenges facing immunotherapeutic strategies aimed at restoring balance between IL-18 and its antagonist in these patients.

IL-18 is a pro-inflammatory cytokine belonging to the IL-1 family and is produced in the body from macrophages, epithelial and dendritic cells, keratinocytes, adrenal cortex etc. The cytokine is produced as an inactive precursor that is cleaved inside cells into its mature form by activated caspase 1, which exists as an inactive precursor in human cells and requires assembly of an inflammasomes for its activation. We show here for the first time that human platelets contain transcripts for the IL-18 gene. They synthesize the cytokine de novo, process and release it upon activation. The activation also results in the assembly of an inflammasome and activation of caspase-1. Platelets also contain the IL-18 antagonist, the IL-18-Binding Protein (IL-18BP); however, it is not synthesized in them de novo, is present in pre-made form and is released irrespective of platelet activation. IL-18 and IL-18BP co-localize to α granules inside platelets and are secreted out with different kinetics. Platelet activation contributes to plasma concentrations in healthy individuals, as their plasma samples contain abundant IL-18, while their platelet-poor plasma samples contain very little amounts of the cytokine. The plasma and PPP samples from these donors, however, contain comparable amounts of IL-18BP. Unlike healthy individuals, the platelet-poor plasma from HIV-infected individuals contains significant amounts of IL-18. Our findings have important implications for viral infections and other human diseases that are accompanied by platelet activation.

The aim of this study was to investigate the possible protective effect of interleukin 18-binding protein (IL-18BP) on ischemia-reperfusion (I/R)-induced liver injury in experimental rat models. Liver is one of the most affected organs from I/R process. IL-18 is an important proinflammatory cytokine, which may induce some events such as production of reactive oxygen substances and release of various cytokines. IL-18BP acts as an inhibitor of IL-18. The relationship between IL-18 and IL-18BP has an important place in inflammatory process. Rats were equally divided into three groups as follows: sham: Hepatic pedicle dissection was done, but hepatic pedicle clamping was not used. I/R: Sixty minutes of ischemia and 2 h of reperfusion were applied. IR + IL-18BP: Recombinant human IL-18BP (100 μg/kg) was administered 30 min before the surgery. Hepatic pedicle was clamped during 60 min of ischemia and 2 h of reperfusion was achieved. Liver enzyme levels were significantly lower in the IR + IL-18BP group, when compared with the I/R group. Serum and tissue levels of tumor necrosis factor-α, IL-6, and IL-18 were considerably lower in the IR + IL-18BP group, when compared with the I/R group, but hepatic interferon-γ and IL1β levels were not significant. Serum oxidative stress index level was significantly higher in the I/R group, when compared with the IR + IL-18BP group. In immunostaining, it was observed that pathologic changes were lower in IR + IL-18BP group than the I/R group. IL-18BP exhibited anti-inflammatory, antioxidant, and protective effects in I/R-mediated hepatic injury via regulating some liver enzyme activities and cytokine levels. Additionally, these effects have been verified by histomorphologic examination and oxidative stress markers.

Severe local and systemic tissue damage called ischemia/reperfusion (IR) injury occurs during the period of reperfusion. Free oxygen radicals and proinflammatory cytokines are responsible for reperfusion injury. IL-18 binding protein (IL-18BP) is a natural inhibitor of IL-18. The balance between IL-18 and IL-18BP has an important role in the inflammatory setting. The present study aimed to investigate whether IL-18BP had a protective role in remote organ hepatic IR injury. Wistar-Albino rats were divided into three groups that contained seven rats. Group I (sham): Laparotomy and infrarenal abdominal aorta (AA) dissection were done but no clamping was done. Group II (I/R): The infrarenal AA was clamped by atraumatic microvascular clamp for 30 minutes and then was exposed to 90 minutes of reperfusion. Group III (IR + IL-18BP): 75 µg/kg of IL-18BP in 0.9% saline (1 mL) was administered 30 minutes before infrarenal AA dissection and clamping; 30 minutes of ischemia was applied and then was exposed to 90 minutes of reperfusion. Serum AST, ALT, and LDH levels were remarkably higher in IR group and returned to normal levels in treatment group. The proinflammatory cytokine levels had decreased in treatment group, and was statistically significant compared with the IR group. Serum levels of total oxidant status and oxidative stress index decreased and levels of total antioxidant status increased by IL-18BP. This study suggested that IL-18BP has antioxidant, anti-inflammatory and hepatoprotective effects in cases of IR with infrarenal AA induced liver oxidative damage.

Interleukin-18 (IL-18) is a proinflammatory cytokine which induces interferon-γ production and plays a crucial role in immune systems. IL-18 binding protein (IL-18BP) is a naturally occurring inhibitor of IL-18. The aim was to investigate the involvement of IL-18 and IL-18BP in IgA nephropathy (IgAN). Serum samples from 21 IgAN patients and 16 idiopathic membranous nephropathy (MN) patients and 32 healthy controls were assayed by an enzyme-linked immunosorbent method. Compared to the controls, IgAN patients showed significantly higher levels of IL-18 and the increased IL-18/IL-18BP ratio. Despite IL-18 elevation, the levels of IL-18BP did not parallel the increase of IL-18, which resulted in an increased IL-18/IL-18BP ratio. Furthermore, the ratio in patients with renal vasculopathy was significantly increased compared to those without arteriolar lesions. These findings provide the first evidence that there is an imbalance of IL-18/IL-18BP ratio in IgAN patients, which may be associated with the pathophysiology of renal vasculopathy.

In patients, an association exists between pulmonary diseases and diastolic dysfunction of the left ventricle (LV). We have previously shown that alveolar hypoxia in mice induces LV diastolic dysfunction and that mice exposed to hypoxia have increased levels of circulating interleukin-18 (IL-18), suggesting involvement of IL-18 in development of diastolic dysfunction. IL-18 binding protein (IL-18BP) is a natural inhibitor of IL-18. In this study, we hypothesized that neutralization of IL-18 during alveolar hypoxia would improve LV diastolic function. Mice were exposed to 10% oxygen for 2 weeks while treated with IL-18BP or vehicle. Cardiac function and morphology were measured using echocardiography, intraventricular pressure measurements and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). For characterization of molecular changes in the heart, both real-time PCR and Western blotting were performed. ELISA technique was used to measure levels of circulating cytokines. As expected, exposure to hypoxia-induced LV diastolic dysfunction, as shown by prolonged time constant of isovolumic relaxation (τ). Improved relaxation with IL-18BP treatment was demonstrated by a significant reduction towards control τ values. Decreased levels of phosphorylated phospholamban (P-PLB) in hypoxia, but normalization by IL-18BP treatment suggest a role for IL-18 in regulation of calcium-handling proteins in hypoxia-induced diastolic dysfunction. In addition, MRI showed less increase in right ventricular (RV) wall thickness in IL-18BP-treated animals exposed to hypoxia, indicating an effect on RV hypertrophy. Neutralization of IL-18 during alveolar hypoxia improves LV diastolic function and partly prevents RV hypertrophy.

IL-18 is a proinflammatory and immune regulatory cytokine, member of the IL-1 family. IL-18 was initially identified as an IFN-γ-inducing factor in T and NK cells, involved in Th1 responses. IL-18 is produced as an inactive precursor (pro-IL-18) that is enzymatically processed into a mature form by Casp1. Different cells, such as macrophages, DCs, microglial cells, synovial fibroblasts, and epithelial cells, express pro-IL-18, and the production of bioactive IL-18 is mainly regulated at the processing level. PAMP or DAMP molecules activate inflammasomes, which trigger Casp1 activation and IL-18 conversion. The natural inhibitor IL-18BP , whose production is enhanced by IFN-γ and IL-27, further regulates IL-18 activity in the extracellular environment. Inflammasomes and IL-18 represent double-edged swords in cancer, as their activation may promote tumor development and progression or oppositely, enhance anti-tumor immunity and limit tumor growth. IL-18 has shown anti-tumor activity in different preclinical models of cancer immunotherapy through the activation of NK and/or T cell responses and has been tested in clinical studies in cancer patients. However, the dual role of IL-18 in different experimental tumor models and human cancers raises critical issues on its therapeutic use in cancer. This review will summarize the biology of the IL-18/IL-18R/IL-18BP system and will address the role of IL-18 and its inhibitor, IL-18BP, in cancer biology and immunotherapy.
