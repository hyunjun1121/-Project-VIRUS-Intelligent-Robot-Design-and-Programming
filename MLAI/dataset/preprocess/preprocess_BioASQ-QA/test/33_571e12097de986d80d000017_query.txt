This Phase IIb, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial evaluated the efficacy, safety, tolerability and pharmacokinetics of empagliflozin in patients with type 2 diabetes. Four hundred and eight patients (treatment-naïve or after a 4-week wash-out period) were randomized to receive empagliflozin 5, 10 or 25 mg once daily, placebo or open-label metformin for 12 weeks. The primary endpoint was change in haemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) after 12 weeks. After 12 weeks' treatment, empagliflozin showed dose-dependent reductions in HbA1c from baseline [5 mg: -0.4%, 10 mg: -0.5%, 25 mg: -0.6%; all doses p < 0.0001 vs. placebo (+0.09%)]. Fasting plasma glucose (FPG) decreased with empagliflozin [5 mg: -1.29 mmol/l, 10 mg: -1.61 mmol/l, 25 mg: -1.72 mmol/l; all doses p < 0.0001 vs. placebo (+0.04 mmol/l)]. Body weight decreased in all empagliflozin groups (all doses p < 0.001 vs. placebo). The incidence of adverse events (AEs) was similar in the placebo (32.9%) and empagliflozin (29.1%) groups. The most frequently reported AEs on empagliflozin were pollakiuria (3.3% vs. 0% for placebo), thirst (3.3% vs. 0% for placebo) and nasopharyngitis (2.0% vs. 1.2% for placebo). AEs consistent with urinary tract infections (UTIs) were reported in four (1.6%) patients on empagliflozin vs. one (1.2%) on placebo. Genital infections were reported in five (2%) patients on empagliflozin vs. 0% on placebo. No UTIs or genital infections led to premature discontinuation. In patients with type 2 diabetes, empagliflozin resulted in dose-dependent, clinically meaningful reductions in HbA1c and FPG, and reductions in body weight compared with placebo. Empagliflozin was well-tolerated with a favourable safety profile.

Inhibitors of sodium-glucose co-transporter type 2 (SGLT2) are proposed as a novel approach for the management of type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). Several compounds are already available in many countries (dapagliflozin, canagliflozin, empagliflozin and ipragliflozin) and some others are in a late phase of development. The available SGLT2 inhibitors share similar pharmacokinetic characteristics, with a rapid oral absorption, a long elimination half-life allowing once-daily administration, an extensive hepatic metabolism mainly via glucuronidation to inactive metabolites, the absence of clinically relevant drug-drug interactions and a low renal elimination as parent drug. SGLT2 co-transporters are responsible for reabsorption of most (90 %) of the glucose filtered by the kidneys. The pharmacological inhibition of SGLT2 co-transporters reduces hyperglycaemia by decreasing renal glucose threshold and thereby increasing urinary glucose excretion. The amount of glucose excreted in the urine depends on both the level of hyperglycaemia and the glomerular filtration rate. Results of numerous placebo-controlled randomised clinical trials of 12-104 weeks duration have shown significant reductions in glycated haemoglobin (HbA1c), resulting in a significant increase in the proportion of patients reaching HbA1c targets, and a significant lowering of fasting plasma glucose when SGLT2 inhibitors were administered as monotherapy or in addition to other glucose-lowering therapies including insulin in patients with T2DM. In head-to-head trials of up to 2 years, SGLT2 inhibitors exerted similar glucose-lowering activity to metformin, sulphonylureas or sitagliptin. The durability of the glucose-lowering effect of SGLT2 inhibitors appears to be better; however, this remains to be more extensively investigated. The risk of hypoglycaemia was much lower with SGLT2 inhibitors than with sulphonylureas and was similarly low as that reported with metformin, pioglitazone or sitagliptin. Increased renal glucose elimination also assists weight loss and could help to reduce blood pressure. Both effects were very consistent across the trials and they represent some advantages for SGLT2 inhibitors when compared with other oral glucose-lowering agents. The pharmacodynamic response to SGLT2 inhibitors declines with increasing severity of renal impairment, and prescribing information for each SGLT2 inhibitor should be consulted regarding dosage adjustments or restrictions in moderate to severe renal dysfunction. Caution is also recommended in the elderly population because of a higher risk of renal impairment, orthostatic hypotension and dehydration, even if the absence of hypoglycaemia represents an obvious advantage in this population. The overall effect of SGLT2 inhibitors on the risk of cardiovascular disease is unknown and will be evaluated in several ongoing prospective placebo-controlled trials with cardiovascular outcomes. The impact of SGLT2 inhibitors on renal function and their potential to influence the course of diabetic nephropathy also deserve more attention. SGLT2 inhibitors are generally well-tolerated. The most frequently reported adverse events are female genital mycotic infections, while urinary tract infections are less commonly observed and generally benign. In conclusion, with their unique mechanism of action that is independent of insulin secretion and action, SGLT2 inhibitors are a useful addition to the therapeutic options available for the management of T2DM at any stage in the natural history of the disease. Although SGLT2 inhibitors have already been extensively investigated, further studies should even better delineate the best place of these new glucose-lowering agents in the already rich armamentarium for the management of T2DM.

This randomized, open-label, crossover study investigated potential drug-drug interactions between the sodium glucose cotransporter-2 (SGLT-2) inhibitor empagliflozin and the dipeptidyl peptidase-4 (DPP-4) inhibitor sitagliptin. Empagliflozin is a potent and selective SGLT-2 inhibitor that lowers blood glucose levels by inhibiting renal glucose reabsorption, leading to an increase in urinary glucose excretion. Sitagliptin lowers blood glucose through an insulin-dependent mechanism of action. Sixteen healthy male volunteers received three treatments (A, B, C) in one of two treatment sequences (AB then C, or C then AB). In treatment AB, 50 mg empagliflozin was administered once daily (q.d.) for 5 days (treatment A), immediately followed by coadministration of 50 mg empagliflozin q.d. and 100 mg sitagliptin q.d. over 5 days (treatment B). In treatment C, 100 mg sitagliptin was administered q.d. for 5 days. A washout period of ≥7 days separated treatments AB and C. Coadministration of sitagliptin with empagliflozin did not have a clinically relevant effect on the area under the concentration-time curve of the analyte in plasma at steady state over a uniform dosing interval τ (AUC(τ,ss)) (geometric mean ratio [GMR] 110.4; 90% confidence interval [CI] 103.9, 117.3) or maximum measured concentration of the analyte in plasma at steady state over a uniform dosing interval τ (C (max,ss)) (GMR 107.6; 90% CI 97.0, 119.4) of empagliflozin. Coadministration of empagliflozin with sitagliptin did not have a clinically meaningful effect on the AUC(τ,ss) (GMR 103.1; 90% CI 98.9, 107.3) or C (max,ss) (GMR 108.5; 90% CI 100.7, 116.9) of sitagliptin. Empagliflozin and sitagliptin were well tolerated when given alone or in combination. Five subjects (31.3%) reported at least one adverse event (AE): three (18.8%) experienced an AE while receiving empagliflozin monotherapy and three (18.8%) while receiving sitagliptin monotherapy. No adverse events were reported during the coadministration period. No AEs were regarded as drug-related by the investigator. These results indicate that empagliflozin and sitagliptin can be coadministered without dose adjustments.

The two main sodium-glucose cotransporters (SGLTs), SGLT1 and SGLT2, provide new therapeutic targets to reduce hyperglycaemia in patients with diabetes. SGLT1 enables the small intestine to absorb glucose and contributes to the reabsorption of glucose filtered by the kidney. SGLT2 is responsible for reabsorption of most of the glucose filtered by the kidney. Inhibitors with varying specificities for these transporters (eg, dapagliflozin, canagliflozin, and empagliflozin) can slow the rate of intestinal glucose absorption and increase the renal elimination of glucose into the urine. Results of randomised clinical trials have shown the blood glucose-lowering efficacy of SGLT inhibitors in type 2 diabetes when administered as monotherapy or in addition to other glucose-lowering therapies including insulin. Increased renal glucose elimination also assists weight loss and could help to reduce blood pressure. Effective SGLT2 inhibition needs adequate glomerular filtration and might increase risk of urinary tract and genital infection, and excessive inhibition of SGLT1 can cause gastro-intestinal symptoms. However, the insulin-independent mechanism of action of SGLT inhibitors seems to offer durable glucose-lowering efficacy with low risk of clinically significant hypoglycaemia at any stage in the natural history of type 2 diabetes. SGLT inhibition might also be considered in conjunction with insulin therapy in type 1 diabetes.

Sodium glucose cotransporter 2 (SGLT2) is the main luminal glucose transporter in the kidney. SGLT2 inhibition results in glycosuria and improved glycaemic control. Drugs inhibiting this transporter have recently been approved for clinical use and have been suggested to have potential renoprotective benefits by limiting glycotoxicity in the proximal tubule. We aimed to determine the renoprotective benefits of empagliflozin, an SGLT2 inhibitor, independent of its glucose lowering effect. We induced diabetes using a low dose streptozotocin protocol in 7-8 week old endothelial nitric oxide (eNOS) synthase knockout mice. We measured fasting blood glucose on a monthly basis, terminal urinary albumin/creatinine ratio. Renal histology was assessed for inflammatory and fibrotic changes. Renal cortical mRNA transcription of inflammatory and profibrotic cytokines, glucose transporters and protein expression of SGLT2 and GLUT1 were determined. Outcomes were compared to diabetic animals receiving the angiotensin receptor blocker telmisartan (current best practice). Diabetic mice had high matched blood glucose levels. Empagliflozin did not attenuate diabetes-induced albuminuria, unlike telmisartan. Empagliflozin did not improve glomerulosclerosis, tubular atrophy, tubulointerstitial inflammation or fibrosis, while telmisartan attenuated these. Empagliflozin did not modify tubular toll-like receptor-2 expression in diabetic mice. Empagliflozin did not reduce the upregulation of macrophage chemoattractant protein-1 (MCP-1), transforming growth factor β1 and fibronectin mRNA observed in the diabetic animals, while telmisartan decreased transcription of MCP-1 and fibronectin. Empagliflozin increased GLUT1 mRNA expression and telmisartan increased SGLT2 mRNA expression in comparison to untreated diabetic mice. However no significant difference was found in protein expression of GLUT1 or SGLT2 among the different groups. Hence SGLT2 inhibition does not have renoprotective benefits independent of glucose lowering.

To evaluate the effects of the sodium glucose cotransporter 2 (SGLT2) inhibitor empagliflozin added to metformin for 12 weeks in patients with type 2 diabetes. This dose-ranging, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial randomized 495 participants with type 2 diabetes inadequately controlled on metformin [haemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) >7 to ≤10%] to receive 1, 5, 10, 25, or 50 mg empagliflozin once daily (QD), or placebo, or open-label sitagliptin (100 mg QD), added to metformin for 12 weeks. The primary endpoint was change in HbA1c from baseline to week 12 (empagliflozin groups versus placebo). Reductions in HbA1c of -0.09 to -0.56% were observed with empagliflozin after 12 weeks, versus an increase of 0.15% with placebo (baseline: 7.8-8.1%). Compared with placebo, empagliflozin doses from 5 to 50 mg resulted in reductions in fasting plasma glucose (-2 to -28 mg/dl vs. 5 mg/dl with placebo; p < 0.0001) and body weight (-2.3 to -2.9 kg vs. -1.2 kg; p < 0.01). Frequency of adverse events was generally similar with empagliflozin (29.6-48.6%), placebo (36.6%) and sitagliptin (35.2%). Hypoglycaemia rates were very low and balanced among groups. Most frequent adverse events with empagliflozin were urinary tract infections (4.0% vs. 2.8% with placebo) and pollakiuria (2.5% vs. 1.4% with placebo). Genital infections were reported only with empagliflozin (4.0%). Once daily empagliflozin as add-on therapy to metformin was well tolerated except for increased genital infections and resulted in reductions in HbA1c, fasting plasma glucose and body weight in patients with type 2 diabetes inadequately controlled on metformin monotherapy.

Type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) is increasing worldwide. Treatment of T2DM continues to present challenges, with a significant proportion of patients failing to achieve and maintain glycemic targets. Despite the availability of many oral antidiabetic agents, therapeutic efficacy is also offset by side effects such as weight gain and hypoglycemia. Therefore, the search for novel therapeutic agents with an improved benefit-risk profile continues. In the following review we focus on a novel class of oral antidiabetic drugs, the sodium glucose transporter protein 2 (SGLT2) inhibitors, which have unique characteristics. SGLT2 inhibitors focus on the kidney as a therapeutic target, where they inhibit the reabsorption of glucose in the proximal tubule, causing an increase in urinary glucose excretion. Doing this, they reduce plasma glucose independently of the β-cell function of the pancreas. SGLT2 inhibitors are effective at lowering hemoglobin A1c, but also induce weight loss and reduce blood pressure, with a low risk of hypoglycemia. In general, the SGLT2 inhibitors are well tolerated, with the most frequent adverse events being mild urinal and genital infections. Since their primary site of effect is the kidney, these drugs are less effective in patients with impaired kidney function but evidence is emerging that these drugs may also have a protective effect against diabetic nephropathy. This review focuses on the most extensively studied SGLT2 inhibitors dapagliflozin, canagliflozin and empagliflozin. Dapagliflozin and canagliflozin have already been approved for marketing by the US Food and Drug Administration. The European Medicines Agency has accepted all three drugs for marketing.

Our previous work has shown that gene knockout of the sodium-glucose cotransporter SGLT2 modestly lowered blood glucose in streptozotocin-diabetic mice (BG; from 470 to 300 mg/dl) and prevented glomerular hyperfiltration but did not attenuate albuminuria or renal growth and inflammation. Here we determined effects of the SGLT2 inhibitor empagliflozin (300 mg/kg of diet for 15 wk; corresponding to 60-80 mg·kg(-1)·day(-1)) in type 1 diabetic Akita mice that, opposite to streptozotocin-diabetes, upregulate renal SGLT2 expression. Akita diabetes, empagliflozin, and Akita + empagliflozin similarly increased renal membrane SGLT2 expression (by 38-56%) and reduced the expression of SGLT1 (by 33-37%) vs. vehicle-treated wild-type controls (WT). The diabetes-induced changes in SGLT2/SGLT1 protein expression are expected to enhance the BG-lowering potential of SGLT2 inhibition, and empagliflozin strongly lowered BG in Akita (means of 187-237 vs. 517-535 mg/dl in vehicle group; 100-140 mg/dl in WT). Empagliflozin modestly reduced GFR in WT (250 vs. 306 μl/min) and completely prevented the diabetes-induced increase in glomerular filtration rate (GFR) (255 vs. 397 μl/min). Empagliflozin attenuated increases in kidney weight and urinary albumin/creatinine ratio in Akita in proportion to hyperglycemia. Empagliflozin did not increase urinary glucose/creatinine ratios in Akita, indicating the reduction in filtered glucose balanced the inhibition of glucose reabsorption. Empagliflozin attenuated/prevented the increase in systolic blood pressure, glomerular size, and molecular markers of kidney growth, inflammation, and gluconeogenesis in Akita. We propose that SGLT2 inhibition can lower GFR independent of reducing BG (consistent with the tubular hypothesis of diabetic glomerular hyperfiltration), while attenuation of albuminuria, kidney growth, and inflammation in the early diabetic kidney may mostly be secondary to lower BG.

Sulfonylureas (SUs) are commonly used in the treatment of type 2 diabetes (T2DM), usually as second-line treatment after the failure of metformin. However, SUs are associated with poor durability, hypoglycemia and weight gain. Empagliflozin is a sodium glucose cotransporter 2 (SGLT2) inhibitor in development for the treatment of T2DM. In Phase II/III trials, empagliflozin reduced hyperglycemia, body weight and blood pressure, with a low incidence of hypoglycemia. The aim of this Phase III study is to compare the effects of empagliflozin and the SU glimepiride as second-line therapy in patients with T2DM inadequately controlled with metformin immediate release (IR) and diet/exercise. After a 2-week placebo run-in, patients were randomized to receive empagliflozin 25 mg once daily (qd) or glimepiride 1-4 mg qd double-blind for 2 years, in addition to metformin IR. Patients who participate in the initial 2-year randomization period will be eligible for a 2-year double-blind extension. The primary endpoint is change from baseline in HbA1c. Secondary endpoints are change from baseline in body weight, the incidence of confirmed hypoglycemia and changes in systolic and diastolic blood pressure. Exploratory endpoints include markers of insulin secretion, body composition and responder analyses. Safety endpoints include the incidence of adverse events (AEs) (including macro- and microvascular adverse events) and changes from baseline in clinical laboratory parameters. Between August 2010 and June 2011, 1549 patients were randomized and 1545 patients were treated. At baseline, mean (SD) age was 55.9 (10.4) years, HbA1c was 7.92 (0.84)%, body mass index was 30.11 (5.59) kg/m², systolic blood pressure was 133.5 (15.9) mmHg and diastolic blood pressure was 79.5 (9.4) mmHg. This is the largest study to compare the efficacy and safety of an SGLT2 inhibitor with an SU in patients with T2DM inadequately controlled on metformin to date. In addition to determining the effects of these treatments on glycemic control over the long term, this study will investigate effects on beta-cell function, cardiovascular risk factors and markers of renal function/damage. The results will help to inform the choice of second-line treatment in patients with T2DM who have failed on metformin. Clinicaltrials.gov NCT01167881.

Type 2 diabetes is characterized by impaired β-cell function associated with progressive reduction of insulin secretion and β-cell mass. Evidently, there is an unmet need for treatments with greater sustainability in β-cell protection and antidiabetic efficacy. Through an insulin and β cell-independent mechanism, empagliflozin, a specific sodium glucose cotransporter type 2 (SGLT-2) inhibitor, may potentially provide longer efficacy. This study compared the antidiabetic durability of empagliflozin treatment (10 mg/kg p.o.) against glibenclamide (3 mg/kg p.o.) and liraglutide (0.2 mg/kg s.c.) on deficient glucose homeostasis and β-cell function in Zucker diabetic fatty (ZDF) rats. Empagliflozin and liraglutide led to marked improvements in fed glucose and hemoglobin A1c levels, as well as impeding a progressive decline in insulin levels. In contrast, glibenclamide was ineffective. Whereas the effects of liraglutide were less pronounced at week 8 of treatment compared with week 4, those of empagliflozin remained stable throughout the study period. Similarly, empagliflozin improved glucose tolerance and preserved insulin secretion after both 4 and 8 weeks of treatment. These effects were reflected by less reduction in β-cell mass with empagliflozin or liraglutide at week 4, whereas only empagliflozin showed β-cell sparing effects also at week 8. Although this study cannot be used to dissociate the absolute antidiabetic efficacy among the different mechanisms of drug action, the study demonstrates that empagliflozin exerts a more sustained improvement of glucose homeostasis and β-cell protection in the ZDF rat. In comparison with other type 2 diabetic treatments, SGLT-2 inhibitors may through insulin-independent pathways thus enhance durability of β-cell protection and antidiabetic efficacy.

Empagliflozin is an orally available, potent and highly selective inhibitor of the sodium glucose cotransporter 2 (SGLT2). This study was undertaken to investigate the effect of food on the pharmacokinetics of 25 mg empagliflozin and to assess dose proportionality between 10 mg and 25 mg empagliflozin under fasted conditions. In this open-label, 3-way, cross-over study, 18 healthy volunteers received 3 single doses of empagliflozin in a randomized sequence (25 mg empagliflozin under fasted conditions, 25 mg empagliflozin after a high-fat, high-calorie breakfast and 10 mg empagliflozin under fasted conditions), each separated by a washout period of at least 7 days. Serial plasma samples were collected at selected time points over a period of 72 hours. Administration with food had no clinically relevant effect on the area under the plasma concentration-time curve (AUC0-∞) of empagliflozin (geometric mean ratio (GMR): 84.04, 90% confidence interval (CI): 80.86 - 87.34). The decrease observed in the maximum plasma concentrations (Cmax) of empagliflozin (GMR: 63.22, 90% CI: 56.74 - 70.44) when administered with food was not considered clinically meaningful. The increases in AUC0-∞ and Cmax for 10 mg vs. 25 mg empagliflozin administered under fasting conditions were roughly dose-proportional, as demonstrated by the slope β of the regression lines being slightly less than 1 (slope β for AUC0-∞: 0.94, 95% CI: 0.90 - 0.97; slope β for Cmax: 0.91, 95% CI: 0.80 - 1.01). Empagliflozin was well tolerated under fed and fasting conditions. The results support administration of empagliflozin tablets independently of food. Increases in empagliflozin exposure under fasting conditions were roughly dose-proportional between 10 mg and 25 mg empagliflozin.

Empagliflozin, a selective inhibitor of the renal tubular sodium-glucose cotransporter 2, was developed for treatment of type 2 diabetes mellitus. Nonclinical safety of empagliflozin was studied in a battery of tests to support global market authorization. Safety pharmacology studies indicated no effect of empagliflozin on measures of respiratory or central nervous system function in rats or cardiovascular safety in telemeterized dogs. In CD-1 mouse, Wistar Han rat, or beagle dogs up to 13, 26, or 52 weeks of treatment, respectively, empagliflozin exhibited a toxicity profile consistent with secondary supratherapeutic pharmacology related to glucose loss and included decreased body weight and body fat, increased food consumption, diarrhea, dehydration, decreased serum glucose and increases in other serum parameters reflective of increased protein catabolism, gluconeogenesis, and electrolyte imbalances, and urinary changes such as polyuria and glucosuria. Microscopic changes were consistently observed in kidney and included tubular nephropathy and interstitial nephritis (dog), renal mineralization (rat) and tubular epithelial cell karyomegaly, single cell necrosis, cystic hyperplasia, and hypertrophy (mouse). Empagliflozin was not genotoxic. Empagliflozin was not carcinogenic in female mice or female rats. Renal adenoma and carcinoma were induced in male mice only at exposures 45 times the maximum clinical dose. These tumors were associated with a spectrum of nonneoplastic changes suggestive of a nongenotoxic, cytotoxic, and cellular proliferation-driven mechanism. In male rats, testicular interstitial cell tumors and hemangiomas of the mesenteric lymph node were observed; both tumors are common in rats and are unlikely to be relevant to humans. These studies demonstrate the nonclinical safety of empagliflozin.

Sodium glucose cotransporter-2 (SGLT-2) is key to reabsorption of glucose in the kidney. SGLT-2 inhibitors are in clinical development for treatment of type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). The mechanism may be of value also in the treatment of type 1 diabetes mellitus (T1DM). This study investigated effects of the SGLT-2 inhibitor, empagliflozin, alone and in combination with insulin, on glucose homeostasis in an animal model of T1DM. Sprague-Dawley rats were administered a single intraperitoneal injection of streptozotocin (STZ; 60 mg/kg). Acutely, STZ rats received two doses of insulin glargine with or without empagliflozin, and blood glucose was measured. In a subchronic study, STZ rats received empagliflozin alone, one or two insulin-releasing implants or a combination of one implant and empagliflozin over 28 days; blood glucose and HbA(1c) were measured. In the acute setting, empagliflozin in combination with 1.5 IU insulin induced a similar glucose-lowering effect as 6 IU insulin. Both interventions were more efficacious than monotherapy with 1.5 IU insulin. In the subchronic study, 12-h blood glucose profile on day 28 in the combination group was lower than with one implant, and similar to two implants. Plasma HbA(1c) was improved in the combination group and in animals with two implants. Empagliflozin reduced blood glucose levels in a T1DM animal model. Empagliflozin combined with low-dose insulin showed comparable glucose-lowering efficacy to treatment with high-dose insulin. Our data suggest that empagliflozin is an efficacious adjunctive-to-insulin therapy with the clinical potential for the treatment of T1DM.

Although several treatment options are available to reduce hyperglycemia, only about half of individuals with diagnosed diabetes mellitus (DM) achieve recommended glycemic targets. New agents that reduce blood glucose concentrations by novel mechanisms and have acceptable safety profiles are needed to improve glycemic control and reduce the complications associated with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). The renal sodium-glucose co-transporter 2 (SGLT2) is responsible for reabsorption of most of the glucose filtered by the kidney. Inhibitors of SGLT2 lower blood glucose independent of the secretion and action of insulin by inhibiting renal reabsorption of glucose, thereby promoting the increased urinary excretion of excess glucose. Canagliflozin, dapagliflozin, and empagliflozin are SGLT2 inhibitors approved as treatments for T2DM in the United States, Europe, and other countries. Canagliflozin, dapagliflozin, and empagliflozin increase renal excretion of glucose and improve glycemic parameters in patients with T2DM when used as monotherapy or in combination with other antihyperglycemic agents. Treatment with SGLT2 inhibitors is associated with weight reduction, lowered blood pressure, and a low intrinsic propensity to cause hypoglycemia. Overall, canagliflozin, dapagliflozin, and empagliflozin are well tolerated. Cases of genital infections and, in some studies, urinary tract infections have been more frequent in canagliflozin-, dapagliflozin-, and empagliflozin-treated patients compared with those receiving placebo. Evidence from clinical trials suggests that SGLT2 inhibitors are a promising new treatment option for T2DM.

Empagliflozin is a potent, oral, selective inhibitor of sodium glucose cotransporter 2 in development for the treatment of type 2 diabetes mellitus. The goal of these studies was to investigate potential drug-drug interactions between empagliflozin and gemfibrozil (an organic anion-transporting polypeptide 1B1 [OATP1B1]/1B3 and organic anion transporter 3 [OAT3] inhibitor), rifampicin (an OATP1B1/1B3 inhibitor), or probenecid (an OAT3 and uridine diphosphate glucuronosyltransferase inhibitor). Two open-label, randomized, crossover studies were undertaken in healthy subjects. In the first study, 18 subjects received the following in 1 of 2 randomized treatment sequences: a single dose of empagliflozin 25 mg alone and gemfibrozil 600 mg BID for 5 days with a single dose of empagliflozin 25 mg on the third day. In the second study, 18 subjects received a single dose of empagliflozin 10 mg, a single dose of empagliflozin 10 mg coadministered with a single dose of rifampicin 600 mg, and probenecid 500 mg BID for 4 days with a single dose of empagliflozin 10 mg on the second day in 1 of 6 randomized treatment sequences. In the gemfibrozil study, 11 subjects were male, mean age was 35.1 years and mean body mass index (BMI) was 23.47 kg/m(2). In the rifampicin/probenecid study, 10 subjects were male, mean age was 32.7 years and mean BMI was 23.03 kg/m(2). Exposure to empagliflozin was increased by coadministration with gemfibrozil (AUC0-∞: geometric mean ratio [GMR], 158.50% [90% CI, 151.77-165.53]; Cmax: GMR, 115.00% [90% CI, 106.15-124.59]), rifampicin (AUC0-∞: GMR, 135.20% [90% CI, 129.58-141.06]; Cmax: GMR, 175.14% [90% CI, 160.14-191.56]), and probenecid (AUC0-∞: GMR, 153.47% [90% CI, 146.41-160.88]; Cmax: GMR, 125.60% [90% CI, 113.67-138.78]). All treatments were well tolerated. Increases in empagliflozin exposure were <2-fold, indicating that the inhibition of the OATP1B1/1B3, OAT3 transporter, and uridine diphosphate glucuronosyltransferases did not have a clinically relevant effect on empagliflozin exposure. No dose adjustments of empagliflozin were necessary when it was coadministered with gemfibrozil, rifampicin, or probenecid. ClinicalTrials.gov identifiers: NCT01301742 and NCT01634100.

Empagliflozin (Jardiance): a novel SGLT2 inhibitor for the treatment of type-2 diabetes.

[PMID: 25712444]
To review available studies of empagliflozin, a sodium glucose co-transporter-2 (SGLT2) inhibitor approved in 2014 by the European Commission and the United States Food and Drug Administration for the treatment of type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). PubMed was searched using the search terms empagliflozin, BI 10773, and BI10773, for entries between January 1, 2000, and December 1, 2014. Reference lists from retrieved articles were searched manually for additional peer-reviewed publications. All publications reporting clinical trials of empagliflozin were eligible for inclusion. Empagliflozin is a new once-daily oral SGLT2 inhibitor with a mechanism of action that is independent of β-cell function and the insulin pathway. Data from a comprehensive phase III clinical trial program have demonstrated its efficacy as monotherapy, as add-on to other glucose-lowering agents, and in different patient populations. In these studies, empagliflozin resulted in improvements in blood glucose levels as well as reductions in body weight and blood pressure. Empagliflozin was well tolerated and was not associated with an increased risk of hypoglycemia versus placebo. The oral antidiabetes agent, empagliflozin, can be used as monotherapy or alongside other glucose-lowering treatments, including insulin, to treat T2DM.

In diabetes, vascular dysfunction is characterized by impaired endothelial function due to increased oxidative stress. Empagliflozin, as a selective sodium-glucose co-transporter 2 inhibitor (SGLT2i), offers a novel approach for the treatment of type 2 diabetes by enhancing urinary glucose excretion. The aim of the present study was to test whether treatment with empagliflozin improves endothelial dysfunction in type I diabetic rats via reduction of glucotoxicity and associated vascular oxidative stress. Type I diabetes in Wistar rats was induced by an intravenous injection of streptozotocin (60 mg/kg). One week after injection empagliflozin (10 and 30 mg/kg/d) was administered via drinking water for 7 weeks. Vascular function was assessed by isometric tension recording, oxidative stress parameters by chemiluminescence and fluorescence techniques, protein expression by Western blot, mRNA expression by RT-PCR, and islet function by insulin ELISA in serum and immunohistochemical staining of pancreatic tissue. Advanced glycation end products (AGE) signaling was assessed by dot blot analysis and mRNA expression of the AGE-receptor (RAGE). Treatment with empagliflozin reduced blood glucose levels, normalized endothelial function (aortic rings) and reduced oxidative stress in aortic vessels (dihydroethidium staining) and in blood (phorbol ester/zymosan A-stimulated chemiluminescence) of diabetic rats. Additionally, the pro-inflammatory phenotype and glucotoxicity (AGE/RAGE signaling) in diabetic animals was reversed by SGLT2i therapy. Empagliflozin improves hyperglycemia and prevents the development of endothelial dysfunction, reduces oxidative stress and improves the metabolic situation in type 1 diabetic rats. These preclinical observations illustrate the therapeutic potential of this new class of antidiabetic drugs.

This open-label, parallel-group study investigated the effect of various degrees of hepatic impairment on the pharmacokinetics, safety and tolerability of the sodium glucose cotransporter 2 inhibitor empagliflozin. Thirty-six subjects [8 each with mild, moderate or severe hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh classification), and 12 matched controls with normal hepatic function] received a single 50 mg dose of empagliflozin. Empagliflozin was rapidly absorbed. After reaching peak levels, plasma drug concentrations declined in a biphasic fashion. Compared with subjects with normal hepatic function, geometric mean ratios (90% confidence interval) of AUC(0-∞) and C(max) were 123.15% (98.89-153.36) and 103.81% (82.29-130.95), respectively, in patients with mild hepatic impairment, 146.97% (118.02-183.02) and 123.31% (97.74-155.55), respectively, in patients with moderate hepatic impairment, and 174.70% (140.29-217.55) and 148.41% (117.65-187.23), respectively, in patients with severe hepatic impairment. Adverse events, all mild or moderate in intensity, were reported in three subjects with moderate hepatic impairment, two subjects with severe hepatic impairment and six subjects with normal hepatic function. Empagliflozin was well tolerated in subjects with hepatic impairment. Increases in empagliflozin exposure were less than twofold in patients with hepatic impairment; therefore no dose adjustment of empagliflozin is required in patients with hepatic impairment.

Oral empagliflozin (Jardiance(®)), a sodium glucose cotransporter-2 (SGLT2) inhibitor, is a convenient once-daily treatment for adult patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus. By inhibiting reabsorption of glucose from the proximal tubules in the kidney via inhibition of SGLT2, empagliflozin provides a novel insulin-independent mechanism of lowering blood glucose. In several phase III trials (≤104 weeks' duration; typically 24 weeks' duration) and extension studies (typically ≥76 weeks' treatment), empagliflozin monotherapy or add-on therapy to other antihyperglycaemics, including insulin, improved glycaemic control and reduced bodyweight and systolic blood pressure in adult patients with type 2 diabetes. In a large phase III trial, as add-on therapy to metformin, empagliflozin was shown to be noninferior to glimepiride at 52 and 104 weeks and superior to glimepiride at 104 weeks, in terms of reductions in glycated haemoglobin level (primary endpoint). Empagliflozin was well tolerated by participants in these clinical trials, with most adverse events being mild or moderate in intensity. Empagliflozin treatment appeared to have no intrinsic risk of hypoglycaemia, although hypoglycaemia occurred more frequently when empagliflozin was coadministered with insulin and/or a sulfonylurea. With its insulin-independent mechanism of action, empagliflozin monotherapy or combination therapy with other antidiabetic drugs, including insulin, provides a useful addition to the therapeutic options for the management of type 2 diabetes. This article reviews the pharmacological properties and clinical use of empagliflozin in patients with type 2 diabetes.

Diabetic nephropathy is the leading cause of end-stage renal disease in humans in the Western world. The recent development of Na+-glucose cotransporter 2 (SGLT2) inhibitors offers a new antidiabetic therapy via enhanced glucose excretion. Whether this strategy exerts beneficial effects on the development of type 2 diabetic nephropathy is still largely unclear. We investigated the effects of the specific SGLT2 inhibitor empagliflozin in BTBR.Cg-Lep<ob>/WiscJ (BTBR ob/ob) mice, which spontaneously develop type 2 diabetic nephropathy. In the first experiment, BTBR ob/ob mice received either a diet containing 300 ppm empagliflozin or equicaloric placebo chow for 12 wk. In the second experiment, BTBR ob/ob mice received 1 μg·kg body wt(-1)·day(-1) ANG II to induce arterial hypertension and were separated into the same two diet groups for 6 wk. In both experiments, empagliflozin treatment enhanced glucosuria, thereby lowering blood glucose. Independently of hypertension, empagliflozin reduced albuminuria in diabetic mice. However, empagliflozin treatment affected diabetes-related glomerular hypertrophy, markers of renal inflammation, and mesangial matrix expansion only in BTBR ob/ob mice without hypertension. In summary, empagliflozin demonstrated significant antihyperglycemic effects, differentially ameliorating early features of diabetic nephropathy in BTBR ob/ob mice with and without hypertension.

Sodium/glucose cotransporter 2 (SGLT2) inhibitors are oral hypoglycemic agents used to treat patients with diabetes mellitus. SGLT2 inhibitors block reabsorption of filtered glucose by inhibiting SGLT2, the primary glucose transporter in the proximal tubular cell (PTC), leading to glycosuria and lowering of serum glucose. We examined the renoprotective effects of the SGLT2 inhibitor empagliflozin to determine whether blocking glucose entry into the kidney PTCs reduced the inflammatory and fibrotic responses of the cell to high glucose. We used an in vitro model of human PTCs. HK2 cells (human kidney PTC line) were exposed to control 5 mM, high glucose (HG) 30 mM or the profibrotic cytokine transforming growth factor beta (TGFβ1; 0.5 ng/ml) in the presence and absence of empagliflozin for up to 72 h. SGLT1 and 2 expression and various inflammatory/fibrotic markers were assessed. A chromatin immunoprecipitation assay was used to determine the binding of phosphorylated smad3 to the promoter region of the SGLT2 gene. Our data showed that TGFβ1 but not HG increased SGLT2 expression and this occurred via phosphorylated smad3. HG induced expression of Toll-like receptor-4, increased nuclear deoxyribonucleic acid binding for nuclear factor kappa B (NF-κB) and activator protein 1, induced collagen IV expression as well as interleukin-6 secretion all of which were attenuated with empagliflozin. Empagliflozin did not reduce high mobility group box protein 1 induced NF-κB suggesting that its effect is specifically related to a reduction in glycotoxicity. SGLT1 and GLUT2 expression was not significantly altered with HG or empagliflozin. In conclusion, empagliflozin reduces HG induced inflammatory and fibrotic markers by blocking glucose transport and did not induce a compensatory increase in SGLT1/GLUT2 expression. Although HG itself does not regulate SGLT2 expression in our model, TGFβ increases SGLT2 expression through phosphorylated smad3.

Data from five randomized, placebo-controlled, multiple oral dose studies of empagliflozin in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM; N = 974; 1-100 mg q.d.; ≤12 weeks) were used to develop a population pharmacokinetic (PK) model for empagliflozin. The model consisted of two-compartmental disposition, lagged first-order absorption and first-order elimination, and incorporated appropriate covariates. Population estimates (interindividual variance, CV%) of oral apparent clearance, central and peripheral volumes of distribution, and inter-compartmental clearance were 9.87 L/h (26.9%), 3.02 L, 60.4 L (30.8%), and 5.16 L/h, respectively. An imposed allometric weight effect was the most influential PK covariate effect, with a maximum effect on exposure of ±30%, using 2.5th and 97.5th percentiles of observed weights, relative to the median observed weight. Sex and race did not lend additional description to PK variability beyond allometric weight effects, other than ∼25% greater oral absorption rate constant for Asian patients. Age, total protein, and smoking/alcohol history did not affect PK parameters. Predictive check plots were consistent with observed data, implying an adequate description of empagliflozin PKs following multiple dosing in patients with T2DM. The lack of marked covariate effects, including weight, suggests that no exposure-based dose adjustments were required within the study population and dose range.

To provide model-based clinical development decision support including dose selection guidance for empagliflozin, an orally administered sodium glucose cotransporter 2 inhibitor, through developed exposure-response (E-R) models for efficacy and tolerability in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). Five randomized, placebo-controlled, multiple oral dose studies of empagliflozin in patients with T2DM (n = 974; 1-100 mg once daily, duration ≤12 weeks) were used to develop E-R models for efficacy (glycosylated haemoglobin [HbA1c ], fasting plasma glucose [FPG] and urinary glucose excretion). Two studies (n = 748, 12 weeks) were used to evaluate tolerability E-R. The efficacy model predicted maximal decreases in FPG and HbA1c of 16% and 0.6%, respectively, assuming a baseline FPG concentration of 8 mm (144 mg dl(-1) ) and 10-25 mg every day empagliflozin targeted 80-90% of these maximums. Increases in exposure had no effect on incidence rates of hypoglycaemia (n = 4), urinary tract infection (n = 17) or genital/vulvovaginal-related (n = 16) events, although low prevalence rates may have precluded more accurate evaluation. E-R analyses indicated that 10 and 25 mg once daily empagliflozin doses achieved near maximal glucose lowering efficacy.

Despite the availability of numerous anti-diabetes drugs and treatment guidelines, many patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) do not reach recommended targets for glycemic control. There remains an unmet need for effective and well-tolerated anti-diabetes agents that can be used as monotherapy or in combination with other therapies to improve glycemic control in patients with T2DM. Sodium glucose cotransporter 2 (SGLT2) inhibitors are a new class of treatment for T2DM that reduce hyperglycemia by reducing renal glucose reabsorption and thereby increasing urinary glucose excretion. This paper reviews the pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic properties of the SGLT2 inhibitor empagliflozin , the results of clinical trials investigating the efficacy of empagliflozin given as monotherapy or as add-on therapy on glycemic control, body weight, and blood pressure in patients with T2DM, and the safety and tolerability profile of empagliflozin. Empagliflozin offers good glycemic efficacy, weight loss, blood pressure reduction, and a low risk of hypoglycemia. These attributes, coupled with the ability to be used in virtually any combination with other anti-diabetes agents and at any stage in the disease process, provide a welcome new agent to our armamentarium of drugs to help manage T2DM.

We aimed to investigate the efficacy and tolerability of empagliflozin, an oral, potent, and selective inhibitor of sodium-glucose co-transporter 2, in patients with type 2 diabetes who had not received drug treatment in the preceding 12 weeks. In our multicentre, randomised, placebo-controlled, phase 3 trial, we enrolled adults (aged ≥18 years) who had not received oral or injected anti-diabetes treatment in the previous 12 weeks. Eligible patients had HbA1c concentrations of 7-10%. We randomly allocated patients (1:1:1:1) with a computer-generated random sequence, stratified by region, HbA1c, and estimated glomerular filtration rate at screening, to placebo, empagliflozin 10 mg, empagliflozin 25 mg, or sitagliptin 100 mg once daily for 24 weeks. Patients and investigators were masked to treatment assignment. The primary endpoint was change from baseline in HbA1c at week 24 by ANCOVA in all randomly allocated patients who were treated with at least one dose of study drug and had a baseline HbA1c value. This study is completed and registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT01177813. Between Aug 12, 2010, and March 19, 2012, we randomly allocated 228 patients to receive placebo, 224 to receive empagliflozin 10 mg, 224 to receive empagliflozin 25 mg, and 223 to receive sitagliptin. Compared with placebo, adjusted mean differences in change from baseline HbA1c at week 24 were -0·74% (95% CI -0·88 to -0·59; p<0·0001) for empagliflozin 10 mg, -0·85% (-0·99 to -0·71; p<0·0001) for empagliflozin 25 mg, and -0·73% (-0·88 to -0·59; p<0·0001) for sitagliptin. 140 (61%) patients in the placebo group reported adverse events (four [2%] severe and six [3%] serious), as did 123 (55%) patients in the empagliflozin 10 mg group (eight [4%] severe and eight [4%] serious), 135 (60%) patients in the empagliflozin 25 mg group (seven [3%] severe and five [2%] serious), and 119 (53%) patients in the sitagliptin group (five [2%] severe and six [3%] serious). Empagliflozin provides a tolerable and efficacious strategy to reduce HbA1c in patients with type 2 diabetes who had not previously received drug treatment. Boehringer Ingelheim and Eli Lilly.

Empagliflozin is a selective sodium glucose cotransporter 2 (SGLT2) inhibitor that inhibits renal glucose reabsorption and is being investigated for the treatment of type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). In this open-label study, the effect of renal impairment on the pharmacokinetics, pharmacodynamics and safety of a 50 mg dose of empagliflozin was investigated in 40 subjects, grouped according to estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR). Maximum empagliflozin plasma concentrations were similar in subjects with normal renal function and renal impairment. Area under the empagliflozin concentration-time curve (AUC0 -∞ ) values increased by approximately 18, 20, 66 and 48% in subjects with mild, moderate, severe renal impairment and renal failure/end stage renal disease (ESRD), respectively, in comparison to healthy subjects. This was attributed to decreased renal clearance (CLR ). Urinary glucose excretion (UGE) decreased with increasing renal impairment and correlated with decreased eGFR and CLR . Empagliflozin was well tolerated, with no increase in adverse events associated with renal impairment. Renal insufficiency resulted in decreased CLR of empagliflozin, moderately increased systemic exposure and decreased UGE. A single 50 mg dose of empagliflozin was well tolerated in subjects with normal renal function and any degree of renal impairment. The pharmacokinetic results of this study indicate that no dose adjustment of empagliflozin is required in patients with renal impairment.

Empagliflozin is a selective sodium glucose cotransporter-2 (SGLT-2) inhibitor in clinical development for the treatment of type 2 diabetes mellitus. This study assessed pharmacological properties of empagliflozin in vitro and pharmacokinetic properties in vivo and compared its potency and selectivity with other SGLT-2 inhibitors. [(14)C]-alpha-methyl glucopyranoside (AMG) uptake experiments were performed with stable cell lines over-expressing human (h) SGLT-1, 2 and 4. Two new cell lines over-expressing hSGLT-5 and hSGLT-6 were established and [(14)C]-mannose and [(14)C]-myo-inositol uptake assays developed. Binding kinetics were analysed using a radioligand binding assay with [(3)H]-labelled empagliflozin and HEK293-hSGLT-2 cell membranes. Acute in vivo assessment of pharmacokinetics was performed with normoglycaemic beagle dogs and Zucker diabetic fatty (ZDF) rats. Empagliflozin has an IC(50) of 3.1 nM for hSGLT-2. Its binding to SGLT-2 is competitive with glucose (half-life approximately 1 h). Compared with other SGLT-2 inhibitors, empagliflozin has a high degree of selectivity over SGLT-1, 4, 5 and 6. Species differences in SGLT-1 selectivity were identified. Empagliflozin pharmacokinetics in ZDF rats were characterised by moderate total plasma clearance (CL) and bioavailability (BA), while in beagle dogs CL was low and BA was high. Empagliflozin is a potent and competitive SGLT-2 inhibitor with an excellent selectivity profile and the highest selectivity window of the tested SGLT-2 inhibitors over hSGLT-1. Empagliflozin represents an innovative therapeutic approach to treat diabetes.

This open-label study investigated potential drug-drug interactions between empagliflozin and metformin. 16 healthy men received treatment A (empagliflozin 50 mg q.d. for 5 days), treatment B (empagliflozin 50 mg q.d. for 4 days with metformin 1,000 mg b.i.d. for 3 days and 1,000 mg q.d. on Day 4) and treatment C (metformin 1,000 mg b.i.d. for 3 days and 1,000 mg q.d .on Day 4) in the sequence AB then C, or C then AB. Metformin had no clinically relevant effect on the area under the steady state plasma concentration-time curve (AUC(τ,ss) geometric mean ratio (GMR): 96.9; 90% CI: 92.3 - 101.7) or the maximum plasma concentration at steady state (C(max,ss) GMR: 100.5; 90% CI: 88.8 - 113.7) of empagliflozin. Similarly, empagliflozin had no clinically relevant effect on AUC(τ,ss) (GMR: 100.7; 90% CI: 95.9 - 105.6) or C(max,ss) (GMR: 103.6; 90% CI: 96.5 - 111.2) of metformin. The renal clearance of empagliflozin and metformin were unaffected by co-administration. Both drugs were well tolerated alone and in combination and did not cause hypoglycemia. These data support co-administration of empagliflozin and metformin without dose adjustment.

This randomized, placebo-controlled within dose groups, double-blind, single rising dose study investigated the safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of 1 mg to 100 mg doses of empagliflozin in 48 healthy Japanese male subjects. Empagliflozin was rapidly absorbed, reaching peak levels in 1.25 to 2.50 h; thereafter, plasma concentrations declined in a biphasic fashion, with mean terminal elimination half-life ranging from 7.76 to 11.7 h. Increase in empagliflozin exposure was proportional to dose. Oral clearance was dose independent and ranged from 140 to 172 mL/min. In the 24 h following 100 mg empagliflozin administration, the mean (%CV) amount of glucose excreted in urine was 74.3 (17.1) g. The amount and the maximum rate of glucose excreted via urine increased with dose of empagliflozin. Nine adverse events, all of mild intensity, were reported by 8 subjects (7 with empagliflozin and 1 with the placebo). No hypoglycemia was reported. In conclusion, 1 mg to 100 mg doses of empagliflozin had a good safety and tolerability profile in healthy Japanese male subjects. Exposure to empagliflozin was dose proportional. The amount and rate of urinary glucose excretion were higher with empagliflozin than with the placebo, and increased with empagliflozin dose.

Sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 (SGLT2) inhibitors lower glycemia by enhancing urinary glucose excretion. The physiologic response to pharmacologically induced acute or chronic glycosuria has not been investigated in human diabetes. We evaluated 66 patients with type 2 diabetes (62 ± 7 years, BMI = 31.6 ± 4.6 kg/m(2), HbA1c = 55 ± 8 mmol/mol, mean ± SD) at baseline, after a single dose, and following 4-week treatment with empagliflozin (25 mg). At each time point, patients received a mixed meal coupled with dual-tracer glucose administration and indirect calorimetry. Both single-dose and chronic empagliflozin treatment caused glycosuria during fasting (median, 7.8 [interquartile range {IQR}, 4.4] g/3 hours and 9.2 [IQR, 5.2] g/3 hours) and after meal ingestion (median, 29.0 [IQR, 12.5] g/5 hours and 28.2 [IQR, 15.4] g/5 hours). After 3 hours of fasting, endogenous glucose production (EGP) was increased 25%, while glycemia was 0.9 ± 0.7 mmol/l lower (P < 0.0001 vs. baseline). After meal ingestion, glucose and insulin AUC decreased, whereas the glucagon response increased (all P < 0.001). While oral glucose appearance was unchanged, EGP was increased (median, 40 [IQR, 14] g and 37 [IQR, 11] g vs. 34 [IQR, 11] g, both P < 0.01). Tissue glucose disposal was reduced (median, 75 [IQR, 16] g and 70 [IQR, 21] g vs. 93 [IQR, 18] g, P < 0.0001), due to a decrease in both glucose oxidation and nonoxidative glucose disposal, with a concomitant rise in lipid oxidation after chronic administration (all P < 0.01). β Cell glucose sensitivity increased (median, 55 [IQR, 35] pmol • min(-1) • m(-2) • mM(-1) and 55 [IQR, 39] pmol • min(-1) • m(-2) • mM(-1) vs. 44 [IQR, 32] pmol • min(-1) • m(-2) • mM(-1), P < 0.0001), and insulin sensitivity was improved. Resting energy expenditure rates and those after meal ingestion were unchanged. In patients with type 2 diabetes, empagliflozin-induced glycosuria improved β cell function and insulin sensitivity, despite the fall in insulin secretion and tissue glucose disposal and the rise in EGP after one dose, thereby lowering fasting and postprandial glycemia. Chronic dosing shifted substrate utilization from carbohydrate to lipid. Trial registration. ClinicalTrials.Gov NCT01248364 (EudraCT no. 2010-018708-99). Funding.

Treatment of type 2 diabetes mellitus invariably requires the use of multiple daily medications which can impact negatively on patient adherence. As a result, there is growing interest in the use of single-pill combinations that can reduce the pill burden. Many such formulations incorporate metformin, although this agent is not suitable for all patients. The single-pill combination of the dipeptidyl peptidase-4 inhibitor linagliptin with the sodium glucose co-transporter 2 inhibitor empagliflozin offers a new and attractive option, given their complementary mechanisms of action. Publications with titles containing the keywords 'linagliptin' or 'empagliflozin' were identified from a non-systematic search of PubMed without date restrictions, together with abstracts presented at the annual meetings of the American Diabetes Association and the European Association for the Study of Diabetes 2012-2014. ClinicalTrials.gov was searched for entries containing these two keywords. Additional references known to the author were included. The efficacy and safety of linagliptin and empagliflozin as monotherapy or in combination with other oral antidiabetic drugs has been established through extensive clinical trial programs. Studies specifically evaluating the efficacy/safety of a dipeptidyl peptidase-4 inhibitor/sodium glucose co-transporter 2 inhibitor in combination are limited, but do include two studies of linagliptin/empagliflozin of up to 52 weeks in duration. These studies show that the single-pill combination of linagliptin and empagliflozin produced clinical improvements in glycemic control that were generally superior to the improvements seen with linagliptin and empagliflozin alone, but with a safety profile comparable to that of the individual constituents. The single-pill combination of linagliptin and empagliflozin, with their complementary mechanisms of action, is a promising treatment option for patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus. It would reduce the daily pill burden in this population, potentially improving adherence to, and optimizing the benefits of, treatment of diabetes mellitus.

Empagliflozin is a sodium glucose cotransporter 2 inhibitor in clinical development as a treatment for type 2 diabetes mellitus. The goal of this study was to investigate potential drug-drug interactions between empagliflozin and verapamil, ramipril, and digoxin in healthy volunteers. The potential drug-drug interactions were evaluated in 3 separate trials. In the first study, 16 subjects were randomized to receive single-dose empagliflozin 25 mg alone or single-dose empagliflozin 25 mg with single-dose verapamil 120 mg. In the second study, 23 subjects were randomized to receive empagliflozin 25 mg once daily (QD) for 5 days, ramipril (2.5 mg on day 1 then 5 mg QD on days 2-5) for 5 days or empagliflozin 25 mg with ramipril (2.5 mg on day 1 then 5 mg QD on days 2-5) for 5 days. In the third study, 20 subjects were randomized to receive single-dose digoxin 0.5 mg alone or empagliflozin 25 mg QD for 8 days with single-dose digoxin 0.5 mg on day 5. Exposure of empagliflozin was not affected by coadministration with verapamil (AUC0-∞: geometric mean ratio [GMR], 102.95%; 90% CI, 98.87-107.20; Cmax: GMR, 92.39%; 90% CI, 85.38-99.97) or ramipril (AUC over a uniform dosing interval τ at steady state [AUCτ,ss]: GMR, 96.55%; 90% CI, 93.05-100.18; Cmax at steady state [Cmax,ss]: GMR, 104.47%; 90% CI 97.65-111.77). Empagliflozin had no clinically relevant effect on exposure of ramipril (AUCτ,ss: GMR, 108.14%; 90% CI 100.51-116.35; Cmax,ss: GMR, 103.61%; 90% CI, 89.73-119.64) or its active metabolite ramiprilat (AUCτ,ss: GMR, 98.67%; 90% CI, 96.00-101.42; Cmax,ss: GMR, 98.29%; 90% CI, 92.67-104.25). Coadministration of empagliflozin had no clinically meaningful effect on digoxin AUC0-∞ (GMR, 106.11%; 90% CI, 96.71-116.41); however, a slight increase in Cmax was observed that was not considered clinically relevant (GMR, 113.94%; 90% CI, 99.33-130.70). All treatments were well tolerated. There were no serious adverse events or adverse events leading to discontinuation in any of the studies. No dose adjustment of empagliflozin is required when coadministered with ramipril or verapamil, and no dose adjustment of digoxin or ramipril is required when coadministered with empagliflozin.
