The family of three lipin proteins act as phosphatidate phosphatase (PAP) enzymes required for glycerolipid biosynthesis, and also as transcriptional coactivators that regulate expression of lipid metabolism genes. The genes for lipin-1, lipin-2 and lipin-3 are expressed in key metabolic tissues, including adipose tissue, skeletal muscle and liver, but the physiological functions of each member of the family have not been fully elucidated. Here we examine the most recent studies that provide information about the roles of lipin proteins in metabolism and human disease. Recent studies have identified mutations that cause lipin-1 or lipin-2 deficiency in humans, leading to acute myoglobinuria in childhood or the inflammatory disorder Majeed syndrome, respectively. The effects of lipin-1 deficiency appear to include both the loss of glycerolipid building blocks and the accumulation of lipid intermediates that disrupt cellular function. Several studies have demonstrated that polymorphisms in the LPIN1 and LPIN2 genes are associated with metabolic disease traits, including insulin sensitivity, diabetes, blood pressure and response to thiazolidinedione drugs. Furthermore, lipin-1 expression levels in adipose tissue and/or liver are positively correlated with insulin sensitivity. Studies of lipin-1 in adipocytes have shed some light on its relationship with insulin sensitivity. Lipin-1 and lipin-2 are required for normal lipid homeostasis and have unique physiological roles. Future studies, for example using engineered mouse models, will be required to fully elucidate their specific roles in normal physiology and disease.

Majeed syndrome is an autosomal recessive, autoinflammatory disorder characterised by chronic recurrent multifocal osteomyelitis and congenital dyserythropoietic anaemia. The objectives of this study were to map, identify, and characterise the Majeed syndrome causal gene and to speculate on its function and role in skin and bone inflammation. Six individuals with Majeed syndrome from two unrelated families were identified for this study. Homozygosity mapping and parametric linkage analysis were employed for the localisation of the gene responsible for Majeed syndrome. Direct sequencing was utilised for the identification of mutations within the genes contained in the region of linkage. Expression studies and in silico characterisation of the identified causal gene and its protein were carried out. The phenotype of Majeed syndrome includes inflammation of the bone and skin, recurrent fevers, and dyserythropoietic anaemia. The clinical picture of the six affected individuals is briefly reviewed. The gene was mapped to a 5.5 cM interval (1.8 Mb) on chromosome 18p. Examination of genes in this interval led to the identification of homozygous mutations in LPIN2 in affected individuals from the two families. LPIN2 was found to be expressed in almost all tissues. The function of LPIN2 and its role in inflammation remains unknown. We conclude that homozygous mutations in LPIN2 result in Majeed syndrome. Understanding the aberrant immune response in this condition will shed light on the aetiology of other inflammatory disorders of multifactorial aetiology including isolated chronic recurrent multifocal osteomyelitis, Sweet syndrome, and psoriasis.

Mammalian lipins (lipin-1, lipin-2, and lipin-3) are Mg2+-dependent phosphatidate phosphatase (PAP) enzymes, which catalyze a key reaction in glycerolipid biosynthesis. Lipin-1 also functions as a transcriptional coactivator in conjunction with members of the peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor family. An S734L mutation in LPIN2 causes Majeed syndrome, a human inflammatory disorder characterized by recurrent osteomyelitis, fever, dyserythropoietic anemia, and cutaneous inflammation. Here we demonstrate that mutation of the equivalent serine in mouse lipin-1 and lipin-2 to leucine or aspartate abolishes PAP activity but does not impair lipin association with microsomal membranes, the major site of glycerolipid synthesis. We also determined that lipin-2 has transcriptional coactivator activity for peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-response elements similar to lipin-1 and that this activity is not affected by mutating the conserved serine. Therefore, our results indicate that the symptoms of the Majeed syndrome result from a loss of lipin-2 PAP activity. To characterize sites of lipin-2 action, we detected lipin-2 expression by in situ hybridization on whole mouse sections and by quantitative PCR of tissues relevant to Majeed syndrome. Lipin-2 was most prominently expressed in liver, where levels were much higher than lipin-1, and also in kidney, lung, gastrointestinal tract, and specific regions of the brain. Lipin-2 was also expressed in circulating red blood cells and sites of lymphopoiesis (bone marrow, thymus, and spleen). These results raise the possibility that the loss of lipin-2 PAP activity in erythrocytes and lymphocytes may contribute to the anemia and inflammation phenotypes observed in Majeed syndrome patients.

Monogenic autoinflammatory diseases are disorders of Mendelian inheritance that are characterized by mutations in genes that regulate innate immunity and whose typical features are systemic inflammation without high-titer autoantibodies or antigen-specific T cells. Skin and bone inflammation in the newborn period have been described in 3 of these autoinflammatory disorders: neonatal-onset multisystem inflammatory disease, Majeed syndrome, and deficiency of interleukin-1 (IL-1) receptor antagonist (DIRA) syndrome. This study was undertaken to present the characteristics of the DIRA syndrome in 2 cases from Brazil, and describe a novel mutation in IL1RN. Two unrelated Brazilian patients were evaluated for the clinical signs and symptoms of these 3 disorders, and peripheral blood samples were assessed for mutations in NLRP3, LPIN2, and IL1RN by DNA resequencing analysis. A mutation in IL1RN that encodes a mutant protein was identified, and the expression and function of this mutant protein were compared to those of the wild-type protein. Both patients presented with pustular dermatitis resembling generalized pustular psoriasis, recurrent multifocal aseptic osteomyelitis, and elevation in the levels of acute-phase reactants, all of which are features most consistent with the DIRA syndrome. Chronic lung disease was observed in 1 of the patients, and jugular venous thrombosis was observed in the other patient. Both patients showed a partial response to corticosteroid therapy, and 1 patient experienced an initial improvement of dermatitis with the use of acitretin. Both patients were homozygous for a novel 15-bp (in-frame) deletion on the IL1RN gene. The mutated protein expressed in vitro had no affinity with the IL-1 receptor, and stimulation of the patients' cells with recombinant human IL-1α or IL-1β led to oversecretion of proinflammatory cytokines, similar to the findings obtained in previously reported patients. The presence of the same homozygous novel mutation in IL1RN in 2 unrelated Brazilian patients suggests that this genetic variant may be a founder mutation that has been introduced in the Brazilian population.

Lipin 2 is a phosphatidic acid phosphatase (PAP) responsible for the penultimate step of triglyceride synthesis and dephosphorylation of phosphatidic acid (PA) to generate diacylglycerol. The lipin family of PA phosphatases is composed of lipins 1-3, which are members of the conserved haloacid dehalogenase superfamily. Although genetic alteration of LPIN2 in humans is known to cause Majeed syndrome, little is known about the biochemical regulation of its PAP activity. Here, in an attempt to gain a better general understanding of the biochemical nature of lipin 2, we have performed kinetic and phosphorylation analyses. We provide evidence that lipin 2, like lipin 1, binds PA via the electrostatic hydrogen bond switch mechanism but has a lower rate of catalysis. Like lipin 1, lipin 2 is highly phosphorylated, and we identified 15 phosphosites. However, unlike lipin 1, the phosphorylation of lipin 2 is not induced by insulin signaling nor is it sensitive to inhibition of the mammalian target of rapamycin. Importantly, phosphorylation of lipin 2 does not negatively regulate either membrane binding or PAP activity. This suggests that lipin 2 functions as a constitutively active PA phosphatase in stark contrast to the high degree of phosphorylation-mediated regulation of lipin 1. This knowledge of lipin 2 regulation is important for a deeper understanding of how the lipin family functions with respect to lipid synthesis and, more generally, as an example of how the membrane environment around PA can influence its effector proteins.

The three lipin phosphatidate phosphatase (PAP) enzymes catalyze a step in glycerolipid biosynthesis, the conversion of phosphatidate to diacylglycerol. Lipin-1 is critical for lipid synthesis and homeostasis in adipose tissue, liver, muscle, and peripheral nerves. Little is known about the physiological role of lipin-2, the predominant lipin protein present in liver and the deficient gene product in the rare disorder Majeed syndrome. By using lipin-2-deficient mice, we uncovered a functional relationship between lipin-1 and lipin-2 that operates in a tissue-specific and age-dependent manner. In liver, lipin-2 deficiency led to a compensatory increase in hepatic lipin-1 protein and elevated PAP activity, which maintained lipid homeostasis under basal conditions, but led to diet-induced hepatic triglyceride accumulation. As lipin-2-deficient mice aged, they developed ataxia and impaired balance. This was associated with the combination of lipin-2 deficiency and an age-dependent reduction in cerebellar lipin-1 levels, resulting in altered cerebellar phospholipid composition. Similar to patients with Majeed syndrome, lipin-2-deficient mice developed anemia, but did not show evidence of osteomyelitis, suggesting that additional environmental or genetic components contribute to the bone abnormalities observed in patients. Combined lipin-1 and lipin-2 deficiency caused embryonic lethality. Our results reveal functional interactions between members of the lipin family in vivo, and a unique role for lipin-2 in central nervous system biology that may be particularly important with advancing age. Additionally, as has been observed in mice and humans with lipin-1 deficiency, the pathophysiology in lipin-2 deficiency is associated with dysregulation of lipid intermediates.

Triglyceride (TG) synthesis, storage, and degradation together constitute cytoplasmic TG metabolism (CTGM). CTGM is mostly studied in adipocytes, where starting from glycerol-3-phosphate and fatty acyl (FA)-coenzyme A (CoA), TGs are synthesized then stored in cytoplasmic lipid droplets. TG hydrolysis proceeds sequentially, producing FAs and glycerol. Several reactions of CTGM can be catalyzed by more than one enzyme, creating great potential for complex tissue-specific physiology. In adipose tissue, CTGM provides FA as a systemic energy source during fasting and is related to obesity. Inborn errors and mouse models have demonstrated the importance of CTGM for non-adipose tissues, including skeletal muscle, myocardium and liver, because steatosis and dysfunction can occur. We discuss known inborn errors of CTGM, including deficiencies of: AGPAT2 (a form of generalized lipodystrophy), LPIN1 (childhood rhabdomyolysis), LPIN2 (an inflammatory condition, Majeed syndrome, described elsewhere in this issue), DGAT1 (protein loosing enteropathy), perilipin 1 (partial lipodystrophy), CGI-58 (gene ABHD5, neutral lipid storage disease (NLSD) with ichthyosis and "Jordan's anomaly" of vacuolated polymorphonuclear leukocytes), adipose triglyceride lipase (ATGL, gene PNPLA2, NLSD with myopathy, cardiomyopathy and Jordan's anomaly), hormone-sensitive lipase (HSL, gene LIPE, hypertriglyceridemia, and insulin resistance). Two inborn errors of glycerol metabolism are known: glycerol kinase (GK, causing pseudohypertriglyceridemia) and glycerol-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GPD1, childhood hepatic steatosis). Mouse models often resemble human phenotypes but may diverge markedly. Inborn errors have been described for less than one-third of CTGM enzymes, and new phenotypes may yet be identified.

Majeed syndrome is an autoinflammatory disorder consisting of chronic recurrent multifocal osteomyelitis, congenital dyserythropoietic anemia, and neutrophilic dermatosis. To date, 2 unrelated families with Majeed syndrome have been reported. Mutations in LPIN2 have been found in both families. Here we report a third consanguineous family with Majeed syndrome with a novel mutation. The patient, a 3-year-old Arabic girl, had hepatosplenomegaly and anemia as a neonate. At age 15 months, she developed recurrent episodes of fever and multifocal osteomyelitis. In addition, bone marrow aspiration demonstrated significant dyserythropoiesis, suggesting Majeed syndrome. Coding sequences and splice sites of LPIN2 were sequenced in the patient and her mother. A homozygous single-basepair change was detected in the donor splice site of exon 17 (c.2327+1G>C) in the patient; her mother was heterozygous at this site. These data confirm the role of LPIN2 mutations in the etiology of Majeed syndrome.

The SAPHO syndrome (synovitis, acne, pustulosis, hyperostosis, and osteitis) is a rare disorder that mainly affects bone and skin. Chronic multifocal osteitis is the main diagnostic feature. Genetic studies of HLA genes have shown no role for these class II antigens, whereas studies of 2 mouse models (cmo and Lupo) point to a role of the PSTPIP2 gene. We analyzed the PSTPIP2 gene in patients with SAPHO syndrome. In a cohort of 38 patients with SAPHO we analyzed PSTPIP2 and 2 other candidate genes, NOD2/CARD15 (Crohn's disease occurs in about 10% of SAPHO patients), and LPIN2 (clinical similarities of SAPHO with Majeed syndrome). Rare variants of the 3 genes observed in patients with SAPHO were not specific or were not found more frequently compared to controls, suggesting no major pathogenetic role of these genes in the SAPHO syndrome. We found no association between PSTPIP2, NOD2, and LPIN2 variants and the SAPHO syndrome.

Majeed syndrome is an autosomal recessive disorder characterised by the triad of chronic recurrent multifocal osteomyelitis, congenital dyserythropoietic anaemia and a neutrophilic dermatosis that is caused by mutations in LPIN2. Long-term outcome is poor. This is the first report detailing the treatment of Majeed syndrome with biological agents and demonstrates clinical improvement with IL-1blockade. We describe the clinical presentation, genetic analysis, cytokine profiles and response to biological therapy in two brothers with Majeed syndrome. Both boys were homozygous for a novel 2-base pair deletion in LPIN2 (c.1312_1313delCT; p.Leu438fs+16X), confirming the diagnosis. Their bone disease and anaemia were refractory to treatment with corticosteroids. Both siblings had elevated proinflammatory cytokines in their serum, including tumour necrosis factor α (TNF-α), however a trial of the TNF inhibitor etanercept resulted in no improvement. IL-1 inhibition with either a recombinant IL-1 receptor antagonist (anakinra) or an anti-IL-1β antibody (canakinumab) resulted in dramatic clinical and laboratory improvement. The differential response to treatment with TNF-α or IL-1 blocking agents sheds light into disease pathogenesis; it supports the hypothesis that Majeed syndrome is an IL-1β dependent autoinflammatory disorder, and further underscores the importance of IL-1 in sterile bone inflammation.

Chronic recurrent multifocal osteomyelitis (CRMO) is an autoinflammatory disorder that primarily affects bone but is often accompanied by inflammation of the skin and/or gastrointestinal tract. The etiology is unknown but evidence suggests a genetic component to disease susceptibility. Although most cases of CRMO are sporadic, there is an autosomal recessive syndromic form of the disease, called Majeed syndrome, which is due to homozygous mutations in LPIN2. In addition, there is a phenotypically similar mouse, called cmo (chronic multifocal osteomyelitis) in which the disease is inherited as an autosomal recessive disorder. The cmo locus has been mapped to murine chromosome 18. In this report, we describe phenotypic abnormalities in the cmo mouse that include bone, cartilage and skin inflammation. Utilizing a backcross breeding strategy, we refined the cmo locus to a 1.3 Mb region on murine chromosome 18. Within the refined region was the gene pstpip2, which shares significant sequence homology to the PSTPIP1. Mutations in PSTPIP1 have been shown to cause the autoinflammatory disorder PAPA syndrome (pyogenic arthritis, pyoderma gangrenosum and acne). Mutation analysis, utilizing direct sequencing, revealed a single base pair change c.293T --> C in the pstpip2 gene resulting in a highly conserved leucine at amino acid 98 being replaced by a proline (L98P). No other mutations were found in the coding sequence of the remaining genes in the refined interval, although a 50 kb gap remains unexplored. These data suggest that mutations in pstpip2 may be the genetic explanation for the autoinflammatory phenotype seen in the cmo mouse.
