Where is the body would the Peyer's patches be found

[PMID: 11979138]
Peyer's patches play a major role in intestinal immunity, are portals of entry for significant pathogens, and may be important in Crohn's disease. Whereas their microscopic anatomy and immune function are well described, surprisingly little is known of their macroscopic anatomy and distribution. Our aim was to assess their number, area, and distribution in the normal distal ileum, with particular reference to patient age. Distal ilea (200 cm) obtained at autopsy from 55 adults without intestinal disease were opened along the mesenteric border, fixed in acetic acid, and transilluminated. Peyer's patches were counted, and the length, breadth, and distance from the ileocecal valve were recorded. Patches were most numerous in the terminal 10-15 cm where they formed a lymphoid ring. More proximal patches were oval, antimesenteric, and irregularly spaced. By area, 46% of patch tissue occurred in the terminal 25 cm. The mean number of patches ranged from 29.4 +/- 5.4 in the youngest group studied, to 19.0 +/- 3.0 in the oldest. Total patch area was greatest in the group aged 21-30 (47.4 +/- 1.0 cm2). Peyer's patches are concentrated in the distal 25 cm of ileum but extend proximally for 200 cm. The variation in their size, shape, and distribution in different individuals is greater than often appreciated and may influence the presentation of diseases centered on these structures.

Adaptive immune protection of mucous membranes is provided mainly by secretory IgA (SIgA) antibodies. This first-line defence is accomplished through an ingenious cooperation between the mucosal B-cell system and the epithelial glycoprotein called secretory component (SC). This is quantitatively the most important receptor of the immune system because it is responsible for external transport of locally produced polymeric IgA (pIgA), which is the major humoral mediator substance of the whole immune system. Transmembrane SC belongs to the Ig supergene family and functions as a general pIg receptor, also translocating pentameric IgM externally to form secretory IgM. The B-cells responsible for local pIg production are initially stimulated in lymphoepithelial structures, particularly the Peyer's patches in the distal small intestine, from which they migrate as memory cells to exocrine tissues all over the body. Mucous membranes are thus furnished with secretory antibodies in an integrated way, ensuring a variety of specificities at every secretory site. There is currently great interest in exploiting this integrated or "common' mucosal immune system for oral vaccination against pathogenic infectious agents and also to induce therapeutic peripheral tolerance to ameliorate T-cell-mediated autoimmune diseases. Much remains to be learnt about antigen uptake and processing necessary to elicit stimulatory or suppressive mucosal immune responses, and how normal homeostasis is maintained in the intestinal mucosa. Considerable information has accumulated about various types of immune deviation that may lead to local or extraintestinal hypersensitivity reactions against luminal antigen, but the crucial mechanisms remain obscure.

It was suggested just after the beginning of this century that the intestinal mucosa is equipped with its own immune system. However, it was not until 1965 that the major antibody molecule of exocrine secretions was characterized as a unique immunoglobulin called secretory IgA or SIgA. Our knowledge about local production and epithelial transport of SIgA has increased rapidly during the last 10-15 years. A fascinating co-operation between lymphoid B cells and glandular epithelial cells has been delineated. SIgA is in quantitative terms the most important antibody molecule and the intestine is the largest immunological organ of the human body. Antigen-stimulated B and T lymphocytes are distributed from Peyer's patches and other gut-associated lymphoid tissue to exocrine glandular sites all over the body; this is the basis for local generation of SIgA antibodies with an enormous selection of specificities required for protection of the extensive mucosal surfaces. Regulation of this integrated mucosal immune system is quite critical; break in the immunological control of mucosal homeostasis leads to local overactivation of T cells and overproduction of phlogistic IgG (and IgE in atopic individuals). The great immunological activity of the intestinal mucosa may thus in an imbalanced way contribute to tissue damage and inflammatory disease.

Oral immunization has numerous advantages over parenteral administrations. In addition to ease administration, more effective pathogen elimination on the mucosa before spreading into the blood circulation, constitutes the main benefit. This is particularly true for pathogens that enter the body through the oral route. On the other hand, it is the most challenging administration route for peptides, proteins and recombinant antigens due to gastrointestinal (GI) tract, numerous barriers including the harsh environment and the inherent weak immunogenicity. In addition to the adjuvant properties, polymeric particles arise as the most promising strategy to overcome poor antigen bioavailability/ stability upon oral administration. The Peyer's patches have been considered an important structure of the gut associate lymphoid tissue (GALT) for the initiation of the immune response towards particulate oral antigens. The transport mechanism of both, nano and microparticles across intestinal mucosa, particularly throughout Peyer's patches, is discussed in this review. We provide a short and concise update (last decade) focused on the importance of particle physicochemical properties, M-cell ligands and size-dependent transport and intracellular fate concerning Peyer's patches targeted oral vaccination.

During routine lower gastrointestinal endoscopy of children for suspected chronic inflammatory bowel disease, it is possible to visualize lymphoid follicles (Peyer's patches) in the last few centimeters of the terminal ileum. Biopsy specimens have been taken from these Peyer's patches and the lymphoid cells have been isolated by collagenase digestion. The mean cell yield of Peyer's patch cells was 1.7 x 10(8) lymphocytes/g tissue. Isolated Peyer's patch cells were 26%-54% CD3+ (pan T cells), 14%-34% CD4+ (helper/inducer T cells), and 9%-17% CD8+ (suppressor/cytotoxic T cells). Twenty six percent to 48% of the Peyer's patch cells were B cells; less than 1% contained cytoplasmic immunoglobulin A. When stimulated in vitro with phytohemagglutinin or pokeweed mitogen, cells from Peyer's patches proliferated. The successful isolation of functional cells from Peyer's patches will now allow studies to be done at the afferent limb of mucosal immunoregulation in humans.

In the Peyer's patches of the small intestine, specialized epithelial cells, the membranous (M) cells, sample antigenic matter from the gut lumen and bring it into contact with cells of the immune system, which are then capable of initiating specific immune reactions. Using autofluorescence 2-photon (A2P) microscopy, we imaged living intestinal mucosa at a 0.5-μm resolution. We identified individual M cells without the aid of a marker and in vivo analyzed their sampling function over hours. Time-lapse recordings revealed that lymphocytes associated with M cells display a remarkable degree of motility with average speed rates of 8.2 μm/min, to form new M cell-associated lymphocyte clusters within less than 15 min. The lymphocytes drastically deform the M cells' cytoplasm and laterally move from one lymphocyte cluster to the next. This implies that the micro-compartment beneath M cells is a highly efficient container to bring potentially harmful antigens into contact with large numbers of immunocompetent cells. Our setup opens a new window for high-resolution 3D imaging of functional processes occurring in lymphoid and mucosal tissues.

The small intestine hosts specialized lymphoid structures, the Peyer's patches, that face the gut lumen and are overlaid with unique epithelial cells, called microfold (M) cells. M cells are considered to constitute an important route for antigen uptake in the mucosal immune system. Here, we used intravital microscopy to define immune cell populations, which are in close contact with M cells and potentially sample antigen. We present live evidence that DCs enter M cell pockets and highlight the abundance of mononuclear phagocytes in these structures. Taking advantage of the respective reporter animals, we focused on classical DCs that express Zbtb46 and analyzed how these cells interact with M cells in steady state and sample antigen for T cell activation in the Peyer's patches following challenge.

In the rabbit intestine Peyer's patches can easily be distinguished. They are found in the jejunum and ileum, but not in the duodenum. The highest number observed is seven. In most animals the first, i.e. proximally situated patch has a rather well-defined place in the beginning of the jejunum; similarly, the last, i.e. distally situated one mostly has its place in the end of the ileum. The demarcation of the three classical sections of the small intestine is discussed from a comparative viewpoint with special criticism as to what is called ileum in man.

Pro-inflammatory mediators hold important functions in human body in response to infection, trauma and vascular disease. However, their action is down regulated by the release of anti-inflammatory cytokines, thus restoring a balance which reflects the immune status of a given individual. Recent studies have stressed out the importance of circulating levels of cytokines for forensic purposes even if there is a lack of studies regarding the role of post-mortem mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue. In this respect, Peyer's patches (PP), represent one of the most important immunological site of the body and the major component of the gut -associated lymphoid tissue. The aim of this study was to evaluate post-mortem PP immune response in 40 serial autopsy cases of people who died from natural and traumatic death. The study examined spontaneous release of the following cytokines by fresh isolated PP cells: interleukin (IL)-12, tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha, IL-10, IL-6, IL-1 beta, and IL-8. Results will show that higher levels of TNF-alpha, IL-6, IL-1 beta, and IL-8 are statistically correlated with the traumatic death group. From a forensic point of view these data demonstrate that fundamental lymphoid organs, such as PP, may have a potential in diagnosing the cause of death.

During the course of their recirculation through the body, blood-borne lymphocytes specifically adhere to high endothelial venules (HEV) within secondary lymphoid organs such as peripheral lymph nodes (PN) and gut-associated Peyer's patches (PP). This adherence event, which initiates the extravasation of the lymphocyte, is highly specific in terms of the class of lymphocyte and the anatomic location of the HEV. We review evidence that the lymphocyte adhesive molecule ('homing receptor') involved in attachment to PN HEV is a carbohydrate-binding receptor (lectin-like) with specificity for mannose-6-phosphate (M6P)-like ligands. We describe the use of a novel cytochemical probe for the detection and characterization of cell surface carbohydrate-binding receptors. Using a M6P-based probe, we show that the carbohydrate-binding receptor on lymphocytes is closely-related or identical to the MEL-14 antigen, a putative homing receptor identified by a monoclonal antibody. Evidence is presented that the lymphocyte attachment sites on both PN and PP HEV are inactivated by mild periodate oxidation and hence are probably carbohydrate in nature. Yet, the sites are biochemically distinguishable in that one class (PN) requires sialidase-sensitive structures whereas the other (PP) does not. We raise the possibility that diversity in the carbohydrate-based recognition determinants on HEV may underlie the adhesive specificities in this system.

Peyer's patch have been extensively studied as a major inductive site for mucosal immunity within the small intestine. The intestinal mucosa contains numerous dendritic cells, which induce either protective immunity to infectious agents or tolerance to innocuous antigens, including food and commensal bacteria. Although during the past few years, several subsets of human mucosal dendritic cells have been described, a precise characterization of the different mouse mucosal dendritic cells subpopulations remains to be achieved with regard to their phenotype and localization in Peyer's patch. In this report, we have investigated by immunofluorescence on cryosection and by flow cytometry, the phenotype and the localization of dendritic cells into Peyer's patch of C57Bl/6 mouse intestine using dendritic cells markers. Positive and double staining for CD11c and BDCA-2, pDC/IPC, DC-LAMP, DC-SIGN, TLR8 and Langerin have been observed revealing new mouse intestinal DC subsets. This study provides new insight in the understanding of mucosal immune responses induced by natural processes as infections but also new perspectives for the evaluation of oral vaccines.

In mammals, macrophages (MF) are present in virtually all tissues where they serve many different functions linked primarily to the maintenance of homeostasis, innate defense against pathogens, tissue repair and metabolism. Although some of these functions appear common to all tissues, others are specific to the homing tissue. Thus, MF become adapted to perform particular functions in a given tissue. Accordingly, MF express common markers but also sets of tissue-specific markers linked to dedicated functions. One of the largest pool of MF in the body lines up the wall of the gut. Located in the small intestine, Peyer's patches (PP) are primary antigen sampling and mucosal immune response inductive sites. Surprisingly, although markers of intestinal MF, such as F4/80, have been identified more than 30 years ago, MF of PP escaped any kind of phenotypic description and remained "unknown" for decades. In absence of MF identification, the characterization of the PP mononuclear phagocyte system (MPS) functions has been impaired. However, taking into account that PP are privileged sites of entry for pathogens, it is important to understand how the latter are handled by and/or escape the PP MPS, especially MF, which role in killing invaders is well known. This review focuses on recent advances on the PP MPS, which have allowed, through new criteria of PP phagocyte subset identification, the characterization of PP MF origin, diversity, specificity, location and functions.

In small ruminants, the development of B cells differs from that in mice or in man. The anti-body repertoire is expanded in the Peyer's patches of the terminal ileum where each B-cell follicle is found by a few cells. To investigate the amount of founder clones in bovine ileal follicles, we have used sex mismatched cattle twins. These animals are chimeric due to placental anastomoses. Y-chromosome targeted in situ hybridization was used to trace donor-derived cells of the male genotype in a female recipient (called a freemartin). A strong clustering of lymphoid cells originating from either twin was seen in the ileal Peyer's patches (IPPs). Furthermore, the follicles displayed a low amount of immunoglobulin heavy chain gene configurations in comparison with the splenic or jejunal follicles. These findings strongly suggest that as in sheep, the B-cell follicles in cattle IPPs develop oligoclonally.

Unlike the Peyer's patches of rats and mice, which are considered to be secondary lymphoid organs, the ileal Peyer's patch of sheep is thought to be responsible for the primary generation of B cells, like the bursa of Fabricius of birds. The ileal Peyer's patch of sheep shows prenatal maturation, antigen-independent lymphopoiesis, a rate of lymphocyte production larger than that of the thymus, and involution at a young age. Follicles contain few T cells and have an IgM+, relatively immature B lymphocyte population, as judged by B-cell differentiation markers. The follicle-associated epithelium of the ileal Peyer's patch is of a special type that sheds carbonic anhydrase-rich, 50-nanometer membrane-bounded particles (carbonic anhydrase-reactive particles; CAP) into the intercellular spaces. The CAP filter into the follicle centre and are taken up by lymphocytes. They represent the epithelial (bursa-like) element in an otherwise mesenchymal stroma of reticular cells embedding the follicle lymphocytes. Transepithelial transport of macromolecules, with the formation of multivesicular body-like cytoplasmic vacuoles, appears to be the basis for CAP formation. The jejunal Peyer's patches are devoid of CAP, persist in the adult animal, contain M cells with clusters of B cells in the follicle-associated epithelium, and have many CD4+ lymphocytes in the follicles and in the interfollicular areas. Aggregates of lymphoid follicles in the large intestine resemble the jejunal Peyer's patches with respect to their lymphocyte population and the ileal Peyer's patch with respect to their follicle-associated epithelium.

We examined age and nutritional related changes in the distribution and size of gut associated lymphoid tissues in the intestinal tract of cotton rats (Sigmodon hispidus). Peyer's patches in the small intestine are prominent, ranging from four to 13, and increase in size (surface area) with age. The average Peyer's patch in the adult cotton rat measured 23.9 mm2. Lymphoid tissue in the cecum was primarily limited to a large aggregate located in the vermiform appendix, which increased in size with age. Age related changes in the number of visible lymphoid follicles in the large intestine were highly significant, increasing from 24.8 in juveniles to 45.1 in adults. Weights of dissectable Peyer's patch tissue in animals consuming a low protein diet were significantly lower in juveniles and greater in subadults compared to those on high protein diets. Relative weights of Peyer's patch tissue averaged 84 to 95% more in low protein-fed animals than in the group on the high quality protein diet. Our results suggest that peripheral lymphoid tissues in wild cotton rats are more resistant to protein deficiencies than other tissues in the body and could be a useful index for assessing nutritional status.

Sex differences in immunity are well described in the literature and thought to be mainly driven by sex hormones and sex-linked immune response genes. The gastrointestinal tract (GIT) is one of the largest immune organs in the body and contains multiple immune cells in the GIT-associated lymphoid tissue, Peyer's patches and elsewhere, which together have profound effects on local and systemic inflammation. The GIT is colonised with microbial communities composed of bacteria, fungi and viruses, collectively known as the GIT microbiota. The GIT microbiota drives multiple interactions locally with immune cells that regulate the homeostatic environment and systemically in diverse tissues. It is becoming evident that the microbiota differs between the sexes, both in animal models and in humans, and these sex differences often lead to sex-dependent changes in local GIT inflammation, systemic immunity and susceptibility to a range of inflammatory diseases. The sexually dimorphic microbiome has been termed the 'microgenderome'. Herein, we review the evidence for the microgenderome and contemplate the role it plays in driving sex differences in immunity and disease susceptibility. We further consider the impact that biological sex might play in the response to treatments aimed at manipulating the GIT microbiota, such as prebiotics, live biotherapeutics, (probiotics, synbiotics and bacteriotherapies) and faecal microbial transplant. These alternative therapies hold potential in the treatment of both psychological (e.g., anxiety, depression) and physiological (e.g., irritable bowel disease) disorders differentially affecting males and females.

Peyer's patches (PPs) play a major role in intestinal mucosal immunity; however, their role in ulcerative colitis (UC) is not well investigated. We evaluated endoscopic features of PPs on narrow-band imaging with magnifying endoscopy (NBI-ME) and investigated their association with clinical factors. We prospectively recruited 105 patients with UC, 18 with Crohn's disease, 16 with disease control, and 33 healthy control subjects at three institutions from 2014 to 2017. NBI-ME images of the villi of PPs were evaluated according to the Villi Index, and patients were divided into the Villi Index low (L) and high (H) types. The 1-year sustained clinical remission rate was evaluated between L-type and H-type PPs in patients with UC. The proportions of patients with H-type PPs were significantly higher among UC, Crohn's disease, and disease control patients than among healthy control patients (P = 0.0125, 0.018, 0.0007). In UC, age, gender, endoscopic score, and extent of disease involvement were not significantly different between L-type and H-type PPs, whereas the sustained clinical remission rate was significantly higher in L-type PPs than in H-type PPs (88% [57/65] vs 65% [17/26], P = 0.019). Multivariate analysis revealed that the L type of PPs was a significant factor for sustained clinical remission (odds ratio 3.8, 95% confidence interval 1.1-12.9, P = 0.033). Patients with UC showed endoscopic alterations in PPs on NBI-ME, and highly altered appearance of PPs can be associated with a high risk of clinical relapse in patients with UC.

Toll-like receptors (TLRs) are key molecular sensors used by the mammalian innate immune system to detect microorganisms. Although TLR functions in colonic immune homeostasis and tolerance to commensal bacteria have been intensively researched, the precise roles of different TLRs in response to pathogen infection in the gut remain elusive. Peyer patches are the major entrance of Salmonella infection and antigen transportation in intestine. Here, we report that, in contrast to TLR5 as a "carrier of Salmonella," TLR11 works as a "blocker of Salmonella" to prevent highly invasive Salmonella from penetrating into the murine Peyer patches and spreading systemically. TLR11 plays an important role in mediating TNF-α induction and systemic inflammation in response to Salmonella infection. Remarkably, in mice lacking TLR11, apparent hemorrhages at Peyer patches are induced by highly invasive Salmonella, a phenotype resembling human Salmonella infection. Therefore, our results indicate a potentially important role for TLR11 in preventing murine intestinal infection and modulating antigen transportation in the gut and imply an important role for various TLRs in cooperation with tight control of pathogens penetrating into Peyer patches. The TLR11 knock-out mouse can serve as a good animal model to study Salmonella infection.

Peyer's patches are gut-associated lymphoid tissue located throughout the intestinal wall. Peyer's patches consist of highly organized ovoid-shaped follicles, classified as non-encapsulated lymphatic tissues, populated with B cells, T cells, macrophages, and dendritic cells and function as an organism's intestinal surveillance. Limited work compares the gene profiles of Peyer's patches derived from different intestinal regions. In the current study, we first performed whole transcriptome analysis using RNAseq to compare duodenal and ileal Peyer's patches obtained from the small intestine of Long Evans rats. Of the 12,300 genes that were highly expressed, 18.5% were significantly different between the duodenum and ileum. Using samples obtained from additional subjects (<i>n</i> = 10), we validated the novel gene expression patterns in Peyer's patches obtained from the three regions of the small intestine. Rats had a significantly reduced number of Peyer's patches in the duodenum in comparison to either the jejunum or ileum. Regional differences in structural, metabolic, and immune-related genes were validated. Genes such as alcohol dehydrogenase 1, gap junction protein beta 2, and serine peptidase inhibitor clade b, member 1a were significantly reduced in the ileum in comparison to other regions. On the other hand, genes such as complement C3d receptor type, lymphocyte cytosolic protein 1, and lysozyme C2 precursor were significantly lower in the duodenum. In summary, the gene expression pattern of Peyer's patches is influenced by intestinal location and may contribute to its role in that segment.

The early replication of certain prion strains within Peyer's patches in the small intestine is essential for the efficient spread of disease to the brain after oral exposure. Our data show that orally acquired prions utilize specialized gut epithelial cells known as M cells to enter Peyer's patches. M cells express the cellular isoform of the prion protein, PrP<sup>C</sup>, and this may be exploited by some pathogens as an uptake receptor to enter Peyer's patches. This suggested that PrP<sup>C</sup> might also mediate the uptake and transfer of prions across the gut epithelium into Peyer's patches in order to establish infection. Furthermore, the expression level of PrP<sup>C</sup> in the gut epithelium could influence the uptake of prions from the lumen of the small intestine. To test this hypothesis, transgenic mice were created in which deficiency in PrP<sup>C</sup> was specifically restricted to epithelial cells throughout the lining of the small intestine. Our data clearly show that efficient prion neuroinvasion after oral exposure occurred independently of PrP<sup>C</sup> expression in small intestinal epithelial cells. The specific absence of PrP<sup>C</sup> in the gut epithelium did not influence the early replication of prions in Peyer's patches or disease susceptibility. Acute mucosal inflammation can enhance PrP<sup>C</sup> expression in the intestine, implying the potential to enhance oral prion disease pathogenesis and susceptibility. However, our data suggest that the magnitude of PrP<sup>C</sup> expression in the epithelium lining the small intestine is unlikely to be an important factor which influences the risk of oral prion disease susceptibility.<b>IMPORTANCE</b> The accumulation of orally acquired prions within Peyer's patches in the small intestine is essential for the efficient spread of disease to the brain. Little is known of how the prions initially establish infection within Peyer's patches. Some gastrointestinal pathogens utilize molecules, such as the cellular prion protein PrP<sup>C</sup>, expressed on gut epithelial cells to enter Peyer's patches. Acute mucosal inflammation can enhance PrP<sup>C</sup> expression in the intestine, implying the potential to enhance oral prion disease susceptibility. We used transgenic mice to determine whether the uptake of prions into Peyer's patches was dependent upon PrP<sup>C</sup> expression in the gut epithelium. We show that orally acquired prions can establish infection in Peyer's patches independently of PrP<sup>C</sup> expression in gut epithelial cells. Our data suggest that the magnitude of PrP<sup>C</sup> expression in the epithelium lining the small intestine is unlikely to be an important factor which influences oral prion disease susceptibility.

The distribution and number of Peyer's patches (5) in two species of marsupial mice, Antechinus swainsonii and Antechinus stuartii was found to be the same even though the length of the intestine in the latter species was half that of the former. Both species lack a caecum and appendix. The position of the Peyer's patches is unusual in that the first three Peyer's patches are on the right side of the small intestine whereas the penultimate and ultimate Peyer's patches are large, contain many lymphoid follicles and are in an anti-mesenteric position in the small intestine and sometimes in the large intestine (ultimate Peyer's patch). The number of Peyer's patches in eutherian mice of similar size, and intestinal length is greater (13) although the number of Peyer's patch lymphoid follicles per centimeter intestine is less (1.8) than in A. swainsonii (4) and A. stuartii (4.4). Marsupial mice have most of their lymphoid follicles confined to a few large Peyer's patches, whereas eutherian mice have fewer lymphoid follicles per unit intestinal length, more Peyer's patches (with fewer lymphoid follicles) evenly distributed along the intestine and more single lymphoid follicles interspersed between them.

The distribution, size, and appearance of Peyer's patches vary according to species. In order to determine the anatomical characteristics of Peyer's patches in small intestine of Bactrian camel, and age-related changes in the number of Peyer's patches, 40 Bactrian camels of the following four age groups were studied: young (0.5-2 years), pubertal (3-5 years), middle-aged (6-16 years), and old (17-20 years). The exact number of Peyer's patches was recorded, and the appearance of Peyer's patches was described in detail. The results indicated that Peyer's patches of Bactrian camels not only have a particular anatomical location and distinct appearance but also change with age. They were distributed in the whole small intestine and there were four distinct types of Peyer's patches: nodular, faviform, cup-shaped, and cystic form Peyer's patches. However, the nodular and cystic form Peyer's patches are specific to Bactrian camel, which have not been found in other animals including Dromedary camel. In addition, the distribution density of Peyer's patches in ileum was the maximum, then was jejunum and duodenum. Further statistical analysis showed that the number of Peyer's patches was altered with age. The number peaked in 5-year-old camels and declined subsequently with age. However, there was little change in the size of Peyer's patches in different age groups; no age-related macroscopic variations in the shape or size of the Peyer's patches were found. Results obtained from this study provide the basic information to further study on the gastrointestinal mucosal immunity of Bactrian camel.
