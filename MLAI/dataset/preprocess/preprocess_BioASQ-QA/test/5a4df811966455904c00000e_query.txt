Which RNA polymerase II subunit carries RNA cleavage activity?

[PMID: 12692127]
Transcript elongation can be interrupted by a variety of obstacles, including certain DNA sequences, DNA-binding proteins, chromatin, and DNA lesions. Bypass of many of these impediments is facilitated by elongation factor TFIIS through a mechanism that involves cleavage of the nascent transcript by the RNA polymerase II/TFIIS elongation complex. Highly purified yeast RNA polymerase II is able to perform transcript hydrolysis in the absence of TFIIS. The "intrinsic" cleavage activity is greatly stimulated at mildly basic pH and requires divalent cations. Both arrested and stalled complexes can carry out the intrinsic cleavage reaction, although not all stalled complexes are equally efficient at this reaction. Arrested complexes in which the nascent transcript was cleaved in the absence of TFIIS were reactivated to readthrough blocks to elongation. Thus, cleavage of the nascent transcript is sufficient for reactivating some arrested complexes. Small RNA products released following transcript cleavage in stalled ternary complexes differ depending upon whether the cleavage has been induced by TFIIS or has occurred in mildly alkaline conditions. In contrast, both intrinsic and TFIIS-induced small RNA cleavage products are very similar when produced from an arrested ternary complex. Although alpha-amanitin interferes with the transcript cleavage stimulated by TFIIS, it has little effect on the intrinsic cleavage reaction. A mutant RNA polymerase previously shown to be refractory to TFIIS-induced transcript cleavage is essentially identical to the wild type polymerase in all tested aspects of intrinsic cleavage.

Budding yeast RNA polymerase III (Pol III) contains a small, essential subunit, named C11, that is conserved in humans and shows a strong homology to TFIIS. A mutant Pol III, heterocomplemented with Schizosaccharomyces pombe C11, was affected in transcription termination in vivo. A purified form of the enzyme (Pol III Delta), deprived of C11 subunit, initiated properly but ignored pause sites and was defective in termination. Remarkably, Pol III Delta lacked the intrinsic RNA cleavage activity of complete Pol III. In vitro reconstitution experiments demonstrated that Pol III RNA cleavage activity is mediated by C11. Mutagenesis in C11 of two conserved residues, which are critical for the TFIIS-dependent cleavage activity of Pol II, is lethal. Immunoelectron microscopy data suggested that C11 is localized on the mobile thumb-like stalk of the polymerase. We propose that C11 allows the enzyme to switch between an RNA elongation and RNA cleavage mode and that the essential role of the Pol III RNA cleavage activity is to remove the kinetic barriers to the termination process. The integration of TFIIS function into a specific Pol III subunit may stem from the opposite requirements of Pol III and Pol II in terms of transcript length and termination efficiency.

RNA polymerase III recognizes and pauses at its terminator, an oligo(dT) tract in non-template DNA, terminates 3' oligo(rU) synthesis within this sequence, and releases the RNA. The pol III subunit Rpc11p (C11) mediates RNA 3'-5' cleavage in the catalytic center of pol III during pausing. The amino and carboxyl regions of C11 are homologous to domains of the pol II subunit Rpb9p, and the pol II elongation and RNA cleavage factor, TFIIS, respectively. We isolated C11 mutants from Schizosaccharomyces pombe that cause pol III to readthrough terminators in vivo. Mutant RNA confirmed the presence of terminator readthrough transcripts. A predominant mutation site, F32, resides in the C11 Rpb9-like domain. Another mutagenic approach confirmed the F32 mutation and also isolated I34 and Y30 mutants. Modeling Y30, F32 and I34 of C11 in available cryoEM pol III structures predicts a hydrophobic patch that may interface with C53/37. Another termination mutant, Rpc2-T455I, appears to reside internally, near the RNA-DNA hybrid. We show that the Rpb9 and TFIIS homologous mutants of C11 reflect distinct activities, that differentially affect terminator recognition and RNA 3' cleavage. We propose that these C11 domains integrate action at the upper jaw and center of pol III during termination.

During DNA transcription, RNA polymerases often adopt inactive backtracked states. Recovery from backtracks can occur by 1D diffusion or cleavage of backtracked RNA, but how polymerases make this choice is unknown. Here, we use single-molecule optical tweezers experiments and stochastic theory to show that the choice of a backtrack recovery mechanism is determined by a kinetic competition between 1D diffusion and RNA cleavage. Notably, RNA polymerase I (Pol I) and Pol II recover from shallow backtracks by 1D diffusion, use RNA cleavage to recover from intermediary depths, and are unable to recover from extensive backtracks. Furthermore, Pol I and Pol II use distinct mechanisms to avoid nonrecoverable backtracking. Pol I is protected by its subunit A12.2, which decreases the rate of 1D diffusion and enables transcript cleavage up to 20 nt. In contrast, Pol II is fully protected through association with the cleavage stimulatory factor TFIIS, which enables rapid recovery from any depth by RNA cleavage. Taken together, we identify distinct backtrack recovery strategies of Pol I and Pol II, shedding light on the evolution of cellular functions of these key enzymes.

Yeast RNA polymerase II enzymes containing single amino acid substitutions in the second largest subunit were analyzed in vitro for elongation-related defects. Mutants were chosen for analysis based on their ability to render yeast cells sensitive to growth on medium containing 6-azauracil. RNA polymerase II purified from three different 6-azauracil-sensitive yeast strains displayed increased arrest at well characterized arrest sites in vitro. The extent of this defect did not correlate with sensitivity to growth in the presence of 6-azauracil. The most severe effect resulted from mutation rpb2 10 (P1018S), which occurs in region H, a domain highly conserved between prokaryotic and eukaryotic RNA polymerases that is associated with nucleotide binding. The average elongation rate of this mutant enzyme is also slower than wild type. We suggest that the slowed elongation rate and an increase in dwell time of elongating pol II leads to rpb2 10's arrest-prone phenotype. This mutant enzyme can respond to SII for transcriptional read-through and carry out SII-activated nascent RNA cleavage.

The transcription elongation factor S-II, also designated TFIIS, stimulates the nascent transcript cleavage activity intrinsic to RNA polymerase II. Rpb9, a small subunit of RNA polymerase II, enhances the cleavage stimulation activity of S-II. Here, we investigated the role of nascent transcript cleavage stimulation activity on the maintenance of transcriptional fidelity in yeast. In yeast, S-II is encoded by the DST1 gene. Disruption of the DST1 gene decreased transcriptional fidelity in cells. Mutations in the DST1 gene that reduce the S-II cleavage stimulation activity led to decreased transcriptional fidelity in cells. A disruption mutant of the RPB9 gene also had decreased transcriptional fidelity. Expression of mutant Rpb9 proteins that are unable to enhance the S-II cleavage stimulation activity failed to restore the phenotype. These results suggest that both S-II and Rpb9 maintain transcriptional fidelity by stimulating the cleavage activity intrinsic to RNA polymerase II. Also, a DST1 and RPB9 double mutant had more severe transcriptional fidelity defect compared with the DST1 gene deletion mutant, suggesting that Rpb9 maintains transcriptional fidelity via two mechanisms, enhancement of S-II dependent cleavage stimulation and S-II independent function(s).

Ternary complexes of vaccinia virus RNA polymerase containing 3'-OMeGMP-arrested transcripts were purified by native gel electrophoresis. These complexes resumed elongation in situ when gel slices were incubated with magnesium and NTPs. Elongation occurred in the absence of pyrophosphate, suggesting that the blocking 3'-OMeGMP residue was removed via a novel pathway. We show that purified elongation complexes contain an intrinsic nuclease activity that shortens nascent RNA from the 3'-end. RNA cleavage was absolutely dependent on a divalent cation and was stimulated by CTP. The initial 5' cleavage product remained associated with the ternary complex and could be elongated in the presence of NTPs. Multiple stepwise cleavages generated progressively shorter chains. Purified ternary complexes containing 3'-OH-terminated RNAs also displayed nuclease activity. Involvement of the vaccinia RNA polymerase subunit rpo30 in the transcript-shortening reaction is suggested based on sequence similarity of rpo30 to mammalian protein SII (TFIIS), an extrinsic transcription factor required for nascent RNA cleavage by RNA polymerase II (Reines, D. (1991) J. Biol. Chem. 267, 3795-3800).

The alpha-amanitin domain or domain f of the largest subunit of RNA polymerases is one of the most conserved of these enzymes. We have found that the C-terminal part of domain f can be swapped between yeast RNA polymerase II and III. An extensive mutagenesis of domain f of C160, the largest subunit of RNA polymerase III, was carried out to better define its role and understand the mechanism through which C160 participates in transcription. One mutant enzyme, C160-270, showed much reduced transcription of a non-specific template at low DNA concentrations. Abortive synthesis of trinucleotides in a dinucleotide-primed reaction proceeded at roughly wild-type levels, indicating that the mutation did not affect the formation of the first phosphodiester bond, but rather the transition from abortive initiation to processive elongation. In specific transcription assays, on the SUP4 tRNA gene, pausing was extended but the rate of RNA elongation between pause sites was not affected. Finally, the rate of cleavage of nascent RNA transcripts by halted mutant RNA polymerase was increased approximately 10-fold. We propose that the domain f mutation affects the transition between two transcriptional modes, one being adopted during abortive transcription and at pause sites, the other during elongation between pause sites.

We have reported previously the isolation and genetic characterization of mutations in the gene encoding the largest subunit of yeast RNA polymerase II (RNAPII), which lead to 6-azauracil (6AU)-sensitive growth. It was suggested that these mutations affect the functional interaction between RNAPII and transcription-elongation factor TFIIS because the 6AU-sensitive phenotype of the mutant strains was similar to that of a strain defective in the production of TFIIS and can be suppressed by increasing the dosage of the yeast TFIIS-encoding gene, PPR2, RNAPIIs were purified and characterized from two independent 6AU-sensitive yeast mutants and from wild-type (wt) cells. In vitro, in the absence of TFIIS, the purified wt polymerase and the two mutant polymerases showed similar specific activity in polymerization, readthrough at intrinsic transcriptional arrest sites and nascent RNA cleavage. In contrast to the wt polymerase, both mutant polymerases were not stimulated by the addition of a 3-fold molar excess of TFIIS in assays of promoter-independent transcription, readthrough or cleavage. However, stimulation of the ability of the mutant RNAPIIs to cleave nascent RNA and to read through intrinsic arrest sites was observed at TFIIS:RNAPII molar ratios greater than 600:1. Consistent with these findings, the binding affinity of the mutant polymerases for TFIIS was found to be reduced by more than 50-fold compared with that of the wt enzyme. These studies demonstrate that TFIIS has an important role in the regulation of transcription by yeast RNAPII and identify a possible binding site for TFIIS on RNAPII.

The eukaryotic transcription factor TFIIS enhances elongation and nascent transcript cleavage activities of RNA polymerase II in a stalled elongation complex. By site-directed mutagenesis, we have demonstrated that invariant residues Asp-261 and Glu-262 of the nucleic acid-binding TFIIS Zn ribbon are critical for stimulation of both elongation and RNA cleavage activities of RNA polymerase II. Substitution of either of these residues inactivates both TFIIS functions, suggesting a related role in both activities. These acidic residues may participate in phosphoryl transfer reactions by a two-metal-ion mechanism in a manner analogous to Klenow fragment. The RNA polymerase II itself may contain a Zn ribbon, in as much as the polymerase's 15-kDa subunit contains a sequence that aligns well with the TFIIS Zn ribbon sequence, including a similarly placed pair of acidic residues.

During gene transcription, the RNA polymerase (Pol) active center can catalyze RNA cleavage. This intrinsic cleavage activity is strong for Pol I and Pol III but very weak for Pol II. The reason for this difference is unclear because the active centers of the polymerases are virtually identical. Here we show that Pol II gains strong cleavage activity when the C-terminal zinc ribbon domain (C-ribbon) of subunit Rpb9 is replaced by its counterpart from the Pol III subunit C11. X-ray analysis shows that the C-ribbon has detached from its site on the Pol II surface and is mobile. Mutagenesis indicates that the C-ribbon transiently inserts into the Pol II pore to complement the active center. This mechanism is also used by transcription factor IIS, a factor that can bind Pol II and induce strong RNA cleavage. Together with published data, our results indicate that Pol I and Pol III contain catalytic C-ribbons that complement the active center, whereas Pol II contains a non-catalytic C-ribbon that is immobilized on the enzyme surface. Evolution of the Pol II system may have rendered mRNA transcript cleavage controllable by the dissociable factor transcription factor IIS to enable promoter-proximal gene regulation and elaborate 3'-processing and transcription termination.

RNA polymerase (Pol) I contains a 10-subunit catalytic core that is related to the core of Pol II and includes subunit A12.2. In addition, Pol I contains the heterodimeric subcomplexes A14/43 and A49/34.5, which are related to the Pol II subcomplex Rpb4/7 and the Pol II initiation factor TFIIF, respectively. Here we used lysine-lysine crosslinking, mass spectrometry (MS) and modeling based on five crystal structures, to extend the previous homology model of the Pol I core, to confirm the location of A14/43 and to position A12.2 and A49/34.5 on the core. In the resulting model of Pol I, the C-terminal ribbon (C-ribbon) domain of A12.2 reaches the active site via the polymerase pore, like the C-ribbon of the Pol II cleavage factor TFIIS, explaining why the intrinsic RNA cleavage activity of Pol I is strong, in contrast to the weak cleavage activity of Pol II. The A49/34.5 dimerization module resides on the polymerase lobe, like TFIIF, whereas the A49 tWH domain resides above the cleft, resembling parts of TFIIE. This indicates that Pol I and also Pol III are distantly related to a Pol II-TFIIS-TFIIF-TFIIE complex.
