IDEAL_ANSWER:
- Familial hypercholesterolemia (FH) is an autosomal dominant inherited metabolic disorder resulting in advanced vascular atherosclerosis and premature death, primarily from coronary artery disease. The primary defect is a mutation in the gene encoding for the plasma LDL receptor located on the short arm of chromosome 19
- Mutations in the LDLr gene (LDLR), which is located on chromosome 19, cause familial hypercholesterolemia
- The chromosomal location of the LDL receptor gene associated with autosomal dominant Familial Hypercholesterolemia is chromosome 19q13.3.
