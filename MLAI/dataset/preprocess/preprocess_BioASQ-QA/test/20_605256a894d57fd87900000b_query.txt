What is blepharospasm?

[PMID: 14871168]
Primary blepharospasm is an adult-onset focal dystonia characterised by involuntary contractions of the orbicularis oculi muscles. Patients may have various types of movements arising from the different parts of the orbicularis oculi muscle. These include typical blepharospasm associated with Charcot's sign, pretarsal blepharospasm and flickering of the eyelids. Primary blepharospasm may be associated with so-called apraxia of eyelid opening as well as dystonia in the lower face, jaw or cervical muscles. Unless there are clinical clues to a symptomatic cause, adults presenting with blepharospasm do not require extensive aetiological investigation because the condition is rarely due to an identifiable condition. As the aetiology of primary blepharospasm is largely unknown, therapeutic approaches are symptomatic, with type A botulinum toxin being the treatment of choice.

Blepharospasm is a form of focal dystonia that manifests as repetitive involuntary closure of the eyes. The pathogenesis of blepharospasm and the neuroanatomic substrates involved are not fully understood. Dysfunction of the basal ganglia traditionally is presumed to be the main cause of most forms of dystonia, but a growing body of evidence suggests that a network of additional cortical and subcortical structures may be involved. The medical records of 1114 patients with blepharospasm seen over past 10 years at Emory University were reviewed to identify potentially contributing brain lesions. A systematic review of the published literature was also conducted to identify potentially contributing brain lesions. Among patients with blepharospasm at Emory University, 18 had focal lesions on imaging studies available for review. The literature review revealed 25 articles describing 30 additional cases of blepharospasm associated with focal lesions. Among all 48 cases, lesions were found in multiple regions including the thalamus (n=12), lower brainstem (n=11), basal ganglia (n=9), cerebellum (n=9), midbrain (n=7), and cortex (n=1). These data in combination with functional imaging studies of primary blepharospasm support a model in which a network of different regions plays a role in the pathogenesis of blepharospasm.

Blepharospasm is a focal dystonia in which the extraocular muscles contract repetitively, leading to excessive blinking and forced eyelid closure. Botulinum toxin type A (BoNTA) is the primary symptomatic treatment for blepharospasm and its effects have been evaluated using numerous rating scales. The main scales in use today were initially used to determine whether BoNTA treatment was superior to placebo, and most controlled trials have confirmed this. More recently, these scales have been used to determine whether there are efficacy differences between different BoNTs in blepharospasm. However, although the scales used in these trials are able to differentiate the effects of BoNT from placebo, they may not be sensitive enough to differentiate between BoNTs. Most of the scales include only four possible points for each item, which would necessitate a 25% greater improvement in one group than the other to detect any differences. Current scales are also relatively insensitive to patients with mild disability who may experience mainly psychosocial problems related to their blepharospasm. Clinical trials comparing BoNTs that include substantial numbers of mildly affected patients may be unlikely to find differences because the scales do not adequately measure mild symptoms. Additional challenges with evaluating blepharospasm include the lack of precision and objectivity of current measures, symptom variability, the need to evaluate aspects of the disorder that are most important to patients, and the different types of blepharospasm. Although no single scale may be able to capture all relevant aspects of blepharospasm, more sensitive and patient-centered scales are needed.

Blepharospasm (BL) is characterized by involuntary closures of the eyelids due to spasms of the orbicularis oculi muscle. The gold standard for clinical evaluation of BL involves visual inspection for manual rating scales. This approach is highly subjective and error prone. Unfortunately, there are currently no simple quantitative systems for accurate and objective diagnostics of BL. Here, we introduce a soft, flexible hybrid bioelectronic system that offers highly conformal, gentle lamination on the skin, while enabling wireless, quantitative detection of electrophysiological signals. Computational and experimental studies of soft materials and flexible mechanics provide a set of key fundamental design factors for a low-profile bioelectronic system. The nanomembrane soft electrodes, mounted around the eyes, are capable of accurately measuring clinical symptoms, including the frequency of blinking, the duration of eye closures during spasms, as well as combinations of blinking and spasms. The use of a deep-learning, convolutional neural network, with the bioelectronics offers objective, real-time classification of key pathological features in BL. The wearable bioelectronics outperform the conventional manual clinical rating, as shown by a pilot study with 13 patients. In vivo demonstration of the bioelectronics with these patients indicates the device as an easy-to-use solution for objective quantification of BL.

The neurophysiological disruptions underlying blepharospasm, a disabling movement disorder characterized by increased blinking and involuntary muscle spasms of the eyelid, remain poorly understood. To investigate the neural substrates underlying reflexive blinking in blepharospasm patients compared to healthy controls using simultaneous functional MRI and surface electromyography. Fifteen blepharospasm patients and 15 healthy controls were recruited. Randomly timed air puffs to the left eye were used to induce reflexive eye blinks during two 8-minute functional MRI scans. Continuous surface electromyography and video recordings were used to monitor blink responses. Imaging data were analyzed using an event-related design. Fourteen blepharospasm patients (10 female; 61.6 ± 8.0 years) and 15 controls (11 female; 60.9 ± 5.5 years) were included in the final analysis. Reflexive eye blinks in controls were associated with activation of the right hippocampus and in patients with activation of the left caudate nucleus. Reflexive blinks in blepharospasm patients showed increased activation in the right postcentral gyrus and precuneus, left precentral gyrus, and left occipital cortex compared to controls. Dystonia severity negatively correlated with activity in the left occipital cortex, and disease duration negatively correlated with reflexive-blink activity in the cerebellum. Reflexive blinking in blepharospasm is associated with increased activation in the caudate nucleus and sensorimotor cortices, suggesting a loss of inhibition within the sensorimotor corticobasal ganglia network. The association between decreasing neural response during reflexive blinking in the cerebellum with disease duration suggests an adaptive role. © 2020 International Parkinson and Movement Disorder Society.

Blepharospasm is a focal dystonia characterized by involuntary cocontraction of the eyelid protractors, causing spasmodic closure of the eyelids. Apraxia of eyelid opening is caused by an inability to initiate lid opening without paralytic abnormality. Some studies suggest that patients with either pure blepharospasm or blepharospasm associated with apraxia of eyelid opening are more prone to developing Parkinson's disease. In our study, <sup>123</sup>I-FP-CIT (DAT) SPECT was performed in 24 patients with either pure blepharospasm or blepharospasm associated with apraxia of eyelid opening and no signs of parkinsonism to identify dopaminergic dysfunction. DAT-SPECT was abnormal in 11 (46%) cases (five patients with isolated blepharospasm and six patients with blepharospasm associated with apraxia of eyelid opening) whose mean disease duration was 11 years. Our study revealed presynaptic dopaminergic dysfunction, as determined by <sup>123</sup>I-FP-CIT or DAT-SPECT, in nearly half of our blepharospasm patients (with or without apraxia of eyelid opening). Thus, the presence of blepharospasm might be an early sign of a parkinsonian syndrome.

Essential blepharospasm is an idiopathic disorder that consists of spontaneous, spasmodic, and involuntary eyelid closure in the absence of ocular disease. Some patients develop an inability to open their eyelids in the absence of orbicularis spasms. These patients have essential blepharospasm combined with apraxia of eyelid opening. Botulinum toxin injections are the treatment of choice for blepharospasm but results may be insufficient, especially in cases associated with apraxia. Apraxia can be treated surgically by levator aponeurosis advancement, frontalis suspension, and upper myectomy. The authors report the first browlift using polypropylene suture to manage eyelid apraxia associated with blepharospasm as an alternative and minimally invasive procedure.

Blepharospasm is an adult-onset focal dystonia that causes involuntary blinking and eyelid spasms. Studies have shown the presence of sensory deficits associated with dystonia. To rule out any confounding effect of muscle spasms on sensory performance in affected and unaffected body regions of patients with blepharospasm and with hemifacial spasm. Participants (19 patients with blepharospasm, 19 patients with hemifacial spasm and 19 control subjects) were asked to discriminate between two stimuli that were either simultaneous or sequential (temporal discrimination threshold, TDT). Pairs of tactile stimuli were delivered with increasing or decreasing inter-stimulus intervals from 0 to 400 ms (in 10-ms steps) to the hands or on the skin over the orbicularis oculi muscle. Tactile stimuli elicited similar TDTs in control subjects and patients with hemifacial spasm, but significantly higher TDTs in patients with blepharospasm, regardless of whether stimuli were applied to the orbicularis muscle or the hand. As TDT was abnormal in unaffected body regions of patients with blepharospasm, and patients with hemifacial spasm processed tactile stimuli normally, TDT deficits in blepharospasm depend on central rather than peripheral factors. This study further supports the link between focal dystonia and impaired temporal processing of somatosensory inputs.

Blepharospasm is a type of focal dystonia depicted by periodic and spontaneous closure of the orbicularis oculi and surrounding muscles. Typical secondary etiologies of blepharospasm may include ophthalmologic and structural brain lesions. In this article, we report a novel case of a patient with a biopsy-proven concurrent papillary carcinoma of the thyroid gland and adenoma of the parathyroid gland with blepharospasm as an exceptionally unique initial manifestation. This report showed that a diagnostic work-up for causes of blepharospasm may include a search for these neoplasm and surgical removal of these masses may offer significant symptomatic control of the focal dystonia.

Benign essential blepharospasm is characterized by abnormal repetitive movements of lid closure and spasm of the orbiculari oculi muscles. Modern theories postulate that this movement disorder originates by abnormal processing of afferent information with further disintegration of the sensorimotor neural program at central levels of the nervous system all of which is seen as dystonic movements in genetically susceptible people. Different investigations including neuroimagin, genetic and neurophysiological studies have discovered new findings on what structures are involved and how this abnormal movement is generated. Among these research is noteworthy the study of electrically elicited blink reflex. It consists of three responses called non-nociceptive (R1), nociceptive (R2) and ultranociceptive (R3). Such blink reflexes, mostly the ultranociceptive response (R3), seem to be very useful to understand more deeply the pathophysiology of this focal dystonia, to perform the functional endophenotyping and to do a more appropriate follow-up of this complex neurological problem.

Blepharospasm, the forcible closure of eyelids, is an infrequent consequence of neuroleptic treatment that, when severe, can interfere with the ability to walk, drive, or work. Like tardive dyskinesia, blepharospasm can be disfiguring and aesthetically distressing, contributing to the increased stigmatization of patients. We report 4 patients with DSM-IV schizoaffective disorder, paranoid schizophrenia, or chronic undifferentiated schizophrenia who developed neuroleptic-induced blepharospasm. In all patients, blepharospasm remitted without the reemergence of psychosis within 3 to 5 months of treatment with clozapine, 100-200 mg/day. The results suggest that clozapine may successfully treat neuroleptic-induced blepharospasm without the reemergence of psychosis in patients with schizophrenia, schizoaffective disorder, or schizophreniform disorder.

'Benign essential blepharospasm' is a human eyelid disorder of unknown aetiology characterized by involuntary, bilateral, and disabling spasmodic contracture of the orbicularis oculi muscle. Treatments are frequently disappointing. Here we report what might be a first step toward developing an animal model for exploring mechanisms of the disorder and potential treatments. We surgically implanted stimulating electrodes into brain areas known to supply input to the lateral division of the facial nerve nucleus to induce blinking by electrical stimulation. Single-pulse stimuli at or near the facial, parabrachial, red, and interstitial nuclei produced consistent stimulus-induced eyelid contractions. Responses were ipsilateral to stimulation, except for the interstitial nucleus where contralateral responses occurred. Little or no other movements of the face, head, or body occurred at eye-blink threshold voltages. When these sites were stimulated with pulse trains, eyelid closures followed stimulus frequency and tended to fuse into constant closure. Thresholds at each stimulus site remained constant during three days of testing. Drug treatments produced no consistent effect on eye-blink threshold from any stimulation site, even when general behaviour was affected. We conclude that these input pathways to the facial nucleus may contribute to blepharospasm and that future neurochemical and electrophysiological study of these pathways may produce a suitable animal model for understanding this disorder.

Essential blepharospasm is a facial dystonia characterized by spontaneous, spasmodic and involuntary contractions of the eyelid muscles. In advanced cases, blepharospasm patients develop severe eyelid spasms that render them functionally blind, socially reclusive, and unable to work or care for themselves. Oculoplastic surgeons frequently have to deal with patients with blepharospasm. The decrease in quality of life caused by this pathology drives all the attention to the resolution of the spasms. However, other conditions may be associated with them and must be kept in mind during the ophthalmological examination. Four patients with essential blepharospasm were diagnosed as glaucomatous during their follow-up at the Oculoplastic Service. All of them showed glaucomatous optic neuropathy and corresponding visual field defect and no clinically apparent secondary cause for their glaucoma. Forced eyelid closure may lead to intraocular pressure peaks. These patients with blepharospasm present repetitive and spasmodic eyelid contractions and the intraocular pressure rise observed during eyelid squeezing could be an additional risk factor for glaucomatous damage. Our case series suggest that patients with blepharospasm should be seriously evaluated for glaucoma.

Objectives Although primary dystonia is typically characterized as a movement disorder, it is also associated with cognitive alterations in the domain of executive functioning which may arise from changes in cortico-basal ganglia circuits. Specifically, in comparison to healthy controls, patients with dystonia show deficits in neuropsychological tests of cognitive flexibility. However, it is unclear whether cognitive inflexibility is caused by the pathomechanisms underlying primary dystonia or by confounding factors such as depression or symptom-related distraction.Methods The present study aimed to eliminate these confounds by examining cognitive flexibility in dystonia patients and in patients with similar motor symptoms but without a comparable central pathophysiology. Eighteen patients with primary blepharospasm, a common form of dystonia affecting the muscles around the eyes, and 19 patients with hemifacial spasm, a facial nerve disorder causing similar eyelid spasms, completed a computerized version of the Wisconsin Card Sorting Test (cWCST). The two groups were further compared on tests of global cognitive functioning, psychiatric symptoms, health status, and impulsiveness. Results Blepharospasm patients committed significantly more errors on the cWCST than patients with hemifacial spasm. Group differences were most pronounced with regard to integration errors, a measure of rule-inference processes on the cWCST. Integration errors were also associated with impulsiveness in patients with blepharospasm. Conclusions Primary blepharospasm is related to deficits in cognitive flexibility, even when blepharospasm patients are compared with patients who suffer from motor symptoms of non-dystonic origin. Our results support the possibility that cognitive inflexibility results from the specific pathophysiological processes underlying primary dystonia. (JINS, 2016, 22, 662-670).

Blepharospasm is a cranial nerve dysfunction in which involuntary and uncontrollable forcible lid closure occurs. Surgical treatment is far from ideal, but the condition can be improved by sectioning the branches of the facial nerve plexus which supply the orbicularis oculi, the frontalis and corrugator muscles, and the midfacial muscles. Not all patients with blepharospasm should be operated upon, since they may expect too much or may enjoy the attention their invalidism has given them. Ectropion of one or both lower lids may occur, and the most severe of all complications is recurrence. This may happen despite a careful microscopic search for the nerve fibers and their division and avulsion. Blepharospasm patients often require considerable psychological support.

Blepharospasm, which is the most frequent cranial dystonia, is characterized clinically by bilateral, synchronous, and symmetric involuntary orbicularis oculi muscle contractions. Assessment of motor abnormalities in patients with blepharospasm is an important issue in the clinical practice of movement disorders. This video highlights the most important aspects in the clinical evaluation of blepharospasm. We will show how we approach the main motor abnormalities related to blepharospasm. Additional features that often characterize blepharospasm, such as increased blinking, sensory tricks that can transiently improve muscle spasms, and apraxia of eyelid opening will also be discussed. Then, we will summarize the main aspects that differentiate patients with blepharospasm from other conditions characterized by eyelid disturbances. Finally, we will take into account the possible therapeutic implications of an accurate clinical examination of patients.

Blepharospasm (BSP) is a rather distressing form of focal dystonia. Although many aspects of its pathophysiological mechanisms are already known, we lack fundamental evidence on etiology, prevention, and treatment. To advance in our knowledge, we need to review what is already known in various aspects of the disorder and use these bases to find future lines of interest. Some of the signs observed in BSP are cause, while others are consequence of the disorder. Non-motor symptoms and signs may be a cue for understanding better the disease. Various cerebral sites have been shown to be functionally abnormal in BSP, including the basal ganglia, the cortex, and the cerebellum. However, we still do not know if the dysfunction or structural change affecting these brain regions is cause or consequence of BSP. Further advances in neurophysiology and neuroimaging may eventually clarify the pathophysiological mechanisms implicated. In this manuscript, we aim to update what is known regarding epidemiology, clinical aspects, and pathophysiology of the disorder and speculate on the directions of research worth pursuing in the near future.

Primary blepharospasm is a focal dystonia characterised by excessive involuntary closure of the eyelids. The pathophysiology of primary blepharospasm is unresolved. To pinpoint grey-matter changes that are associated with primary blepharospasm. 16 right-handed patients with primary blepharospasm (mean age 67.4 (SD 4.3) years; 12 women) were compared with 16 healthy volunteers matched for sex and age. High-resolution T1-weighted magnetic resonance imaging of each participant was obtained and analysed by voxel-based morphometry, a method to detect regionally specific differences in grey matter between patients and control group. To evaluate whether the identified grey-matter changes were correlated with the duration of primary blepharospasm or botulinum neurotoxin treatment (BoNT), separate regression analyses were carried out. In patients with primary blepharospasm, grey-matter increase in the putamina was observed, whereas regression analyses did not indicate a correlation between grey-matter increases and the duration of primary blepharospasm or BoNT. Grey-matter decrease was detected in the left inferior parietal lobule; here regression analyses of grey-matter decrease showed a significant (p = 0.013) correlation of grey-matter decrease with the duration of BoNT. The data suggest structural changes in primary blepharospasm and point to a crucial role of the putamen for the pathophysiology of this focal dystonia.

The current study demonstrates that combining two mild alterations to the rat trigeminal reflex blink system reproduces the symptoms of benign essential blepharospasm, a cranial dystonia characterized by uncontrollable spasms of blinking. The first modification, a small striatal dopamine depletion, reduces the tonic inhibition of trigeminal reflex blink circuits. The second alteration, a slight weakening of the lid-closing orbicularis oculi muscle, begins an adaptive increase in the drive on trigeminal sensory-motor blink circuits that initiates blepharospasm. By themselves, neither of these modifications causes spasms of lid closure, but combined, they induce bilateral forceful blinking and spasms of lid closure. A two-factor model based on these rodent experiments may explain the development of benign essential blepharospasm in humans. The first factor, a subclinical loss of striatal dopamine, creates a permissive environment within the trigeminal blink circuits. The second factor, an external ophthalmic insult, precipitates benign essential blepharospasm. This two-factor model may also be applicable to the genesis of other cranial dystonias.

To describe improvement in blepharospasm with apraclonidine. Blepharospasm is a focal dystonia involving chiefly the orbicularis oculi and periocular muscles resulting in involuntary sustained eyelid closure. Botulinum toxin injection is the mainstay of treatment with meaningful improvement in over 85% of patients, but the effects often wear off within 3-4months. Apraclonidine is an alpha-2 adrenergic receptor agonist, which causes contraction of superior tarsal (Müller) muscle which may improve blepharospasm-related eyelid closure. We propose that apraclonidine may be a useful short-term treatment in patients with blepharospasm, particularly during wearing off from botulinum toxin injection. Patients who had pre-mature wearing off of botulinum injection effect were evaluated before and after the administration of 2 drops of apraclonidine 0.5%-1% solution to each eye. Subjective patient impressions and examiner's impression of symptoms pre and post-apraclonidine administration were recorded. A blinded rater evaluated the videos and provided an independent assessment of the severity of symptoms pre- and post-administration, using a 0-4 scale. Our study included 7 patients (4 male) with a mean age of 61years and mean duration of blepharospasm of 3.6years. There was a subjective, albeit transient (about 2-4h) improvement in blepharospasm reported by all patients and by the examiner. The mean severity scores, based on blinded video ratings, showed a reduction from of 3.4 pre-administration to 2.3 post-administration of apraclonidine (p<0.025). No adverse effects were noted. Apraclonidine is a potentially useful medication for short term management of blepharospasm symptoms while awaiting botulinum toxin injection.
