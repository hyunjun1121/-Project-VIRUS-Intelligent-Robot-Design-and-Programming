Is METTL3 an m6A writer, reader or eraser?

[PMID: 34535671]
Natural killer (NK) cells exert critical roles in anti-tumor immunity but how their functions are regulated by epitranscriptional modification (e.g., N<sup>6</sup>-methyladenosine (m<sup>6</sup>A) methylation) is unclear. Here we report decreased expression of the m<sup>6</sup>A "writer" METTL3 in tumor-infiltrating NK cells, and a positive correlation between proteinÂ expression levels of METTL3 and effector molecules in NK cells. Deletion of Mettl3 in NK cells alters the homeostasis of NK cells and inhibits NK cell infiltration and function in the tumor microenvironment, leading to accelerated tumor development and shortened survival in mice. The gene encoding SHP-2 is m<sup>6</sup>A modified, and its protein expression is decreased in METTL3-deficient NK cells. Reduced SHP-2 activity renders NK cells hyporesponsive to IL-15, which is associated with suppressed activation of the AKT and MAPK signaling pathway in METTL3-deficient NK cells. These findings show that m<sup>6</sup>A methylation safeguards the homeostasis and tumor immunosurveillance function of NK cells.
