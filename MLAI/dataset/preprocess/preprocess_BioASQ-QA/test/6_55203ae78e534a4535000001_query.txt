Psoriasin (S100A7), originally identified in psoriasis, is a calcium-binding protein belonging to the multigenic S100 family. In high-grade ductal carcinoma in situ, psoriasin was identified as one of the most abundant transcripts. We have previously shown that psoriasin was induced by reactive oxygen species (ROS). Moreover, the downregulation of psoriasin by short hairpin RNA (shRNA) led to the reduced expression of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and inhibited tumor growth in vivo. The aim of the present study was to investigate whether psoriasin could have direct effects on endothelial cells. In this study we demonstrated that psoriasin increased VEGF expression in mammary epithelial cells. The treatment of endothelial cells with recombinant psoriasin increased proliferation comparable to that of recombinant VEGF protein. No change in proliferation was seen when endothelial cells were infected with psoriasin-expressing adenoviruses, suggesting that the proliferative effect of psoriasin was mediated by a specific receptor. Treatment with sRAGE, targeting the receptor for advanced glycation end products (RAGE), thus inhibited endothelial cell proliferation and tube formation enhanced by recombinant psoriasin. We showed that VEGF expression was not induced by hydrogen peroxide, when psoriasin was silenced by shRNA, which led to the hypothesis that psoriasin induces ROS. Indeed, psoriasin was shown to induce ROS in both endothelial and epithelial cells. Moreover, sRAGE inhibited the psoriasin-dependent generation of ROS in endothelial cells. Finally, treatment with antioxidant Bcl-2 protein abolished the effect of psoriasin on endothelial cell proliferation. Our data suggest that psoriasin expression in mammary epithelial cells leads to increased endothelial cell proliferation in a paracrine manner through RAGE. Psoriasin may therefore play a role in breast cancer progression by promoting oxidative stress response and angiogenesis.

Psoriasis is a common complex genetic disease characterized by hyperplasia and inflammation in the skin; however, the relative contributions of epidermal cells and the immune system to disease pathogenesis remain unclear. Linkage studies have defined a psoriasis susceptibility locus (PSORS4) on 1q21, the epidermal differentiation complex, which includes genes for small S100 calcium-binding proteins. These proteins are involved in extracellular and intracellular signaling during epithelial host defense, linking innate and adaptive immunity. Inflammation-prone psoriatic skin constitutively expresses elevated concentrations of S100A7 (psoriasin) and S100A15 (koebnerisin) in the epidermis. Here, we report that genetically modified mice expressing elevated amounts of doxycycline-regulated mS100a7a15 in skin keratinocytes demonstrated an exaggerated inflammatory response when challenged by exogenous stimuli such as abrasion (Koebner phenomenon). This immune response was characterized by immune cell infiltration and elevated concentrations of T helper 1 (T(H)1) and T(H)17 proinflammatory cytokines, which have been linked to the pathogenesis of psoriasis and were further amplified upon challenge. Both inflammation priming and amplification required mS100a7a15 binding to the receptor of advanced glycation end products (RAGE). mS100a7a15 potentiated inflammation by acting directly as a chemoattractant for leukocytes, further increasing the number of inflammatory cells infiltrating the skin. This study provides a pathogenetic psoriasis model using a psoriasis candidate gene to link the epidermis and innate immune system in inflammation priming, highlighting the S100A7A15-RAGE axis as a potential therapeutic target.

Psoriasin (S100 A7) was discovered two decades ago as a protein abundantly expressed in psoriatic keratinocytes. Even though much scientific research has been carried out on the characterization of psoriasin, only recent studies point to an important role of psoriasin as an antimicrobial and immunomodulatory protein in skin and other epithelia. In this review, we provide an overview of the major findings in psoriasin research and discuss novel studies highlighting the role of psoriasin as an important effector molecule of the cutaneous barrier.

Psoriasin, originally isolated from psoriasis as an overexpressed molecule of unknown function, has recently been identified as a principal Escherichia coli-killing antimicrobial peptide of healthy skin. The purpose of this study was to investigate the expression and antimicrobial role of psoriasin at the ocular surface and in the lacrimal apparatus. Different tissues of the lacrimal apparatus and ocular surface were systematically analyzed by means of RT-PCR, Western blot, and immunohistochemistry for their ability to express and produce psoriasin. The inducibility and regulation of psoriasin were studied in human corneal as well as conjunctival epithelial cell lines after challenge with ocular pathogens and proinflammatory cytokines. Real-time RT-PCR was performed to evaluate the expression and induction of psoriasin. In addition, tear fluid obtained from different healthy volunteers was examined by ELISA for its psoriasin concentration. RT-PCR and Western blot analyses revealed a constitutive expression of psoriasin in cornea, conjunctiva, nasolacrimal ducts, and lacrimal gland. Immunohistochemistry showed strong staining of meibomian glands for psoriasin. No induction of psoriasin was observed after stimulation with supernatants of E. coli, whereas supernatants of Staphylococcus aureus and Haemophilus influenzae significantly increased the psoriasin mRNA expression. Stimulation with IL-1Î² and VEGF also strongly increased psoriasin transcription. The highest amounts of psoriasin protein were detected in the tear fluid (~170 ng/mL) of healthy volunteers. The results suggest that psoriasin is produced by the structures of the ocular surface and is part of the innate immune system at the ocular surface and tear film.

Human psoriasin (S100A7) has originally been described as a member of the family of S100 calcium-binding proteins which is overexpressed in patients suffering from psoriasis. The bovine homolog was first identified as a cow-derived respiratory allergen. As Escherichia coli mastitis is a common problem in dairy cattle, and human psoriasin was found to exhibit antimicrobial activity preferentially against E. coli, we examined whether the bovine mRNA is expressed in the mammary gland. To demonstrate the antimicrobial activity of bovine psoriasin, we isolated cDNA from the udder, cloned the bovine psoriasin gene in a bacterial expression vector, and the recombinant protein was expressed in BL21 cells. The in vitro antibacterial activity was tested by performing microdilution susceptibility tests and radial diffusion assays with eight different bacterial strains, thereof three different E. coli strains, and one yeast. The antimicrobial activity of the recombinant bovine psoriasin is comparable with human psoriasin and also limited to E. coli. Psoriasin appears to be a part of the local host defense mechanism in the udder, is a putative candidate for a cow-specific factor influencing mastitis susceptibility, and a possible alternative to conventional antibiotics.

S100A7 (psoriasin) and S100A15 (koebnerisin) were first identified in inflamed psoriatic skin. They are of major interest because of their putative functional roles in innate immunity, epidermal cell maturation, and epithelial tumorigenesis. Human S100A7 and S100A15 have lately evolved by gene duplications within the epidermal differentiation complex (chromosome 1q21) during primate evolution forming a novel S100 subfamily. Therefore, S100A7 and S100A15 are almost identical in sequence (>90%) and are difficult to discriminate. Despite their high homology, S100A7 and S100A15 are distinct in tissue distribution, regulation, and function, and thus, exemplary for the diversity within the S100 family. Their different properties are compelling reasons to discriminate S100A7 (psoriasin) and S100A15 (koebnerisin) in epithelial homeostasis, inflammation, and cancer.
