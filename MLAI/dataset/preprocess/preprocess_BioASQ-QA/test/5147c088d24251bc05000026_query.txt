Which type of lung cancer is the most strongly associated with Lambert-Eaton syndrome?

[PMID: 8568672]
1. Human small-cell lung cancer (SCLC) cells are believed to express the antigens responsible for the production of pathological antibodies in the Lambert-Eaton syndrome (LES), a Ca2+ channel disorder in which quantal transmitter release from the motor nerve terminal is impaired. Whole-cell patch-clamp techniques were used to study the voltage-dependent Ca2+ channels expressed by H146 SCLC cells and the effects of LES antibodies on these channels. The types of Ca2+ channels were determined using biophysical properties and pharmacological sensitivity to several antagonists. 2. Whole-cell Ca2+ currents (ICa) in SCLC cells are sensitive to the dihydropyridine (DHP) nicardipine, omega-conotoxin GVIA (omega-CgTX GVIA) and omega-agatoxin IVA (omega-AgTX IVA). Nicardipine at 100 nM and 10 microM reduced ICa by 35 and 45% (n = 38 cells), respectively, while omega-CgTX GVIA (1 microM) inhibited ICa by 32% (n = 31). Application of omega-AgTX IVA at 50 and 100 nM to the cancer cells decreased ICa by 41 and 42%, respectively (n = 22). 3. Measurement of cell membrane capacitance (Cm) revealed that Ca(2+)-dependent exocytosis underlies the secretory activity of SCLC cells. Exocytosis, when induced by step depolarizing pulses and measured by increases in Cm, was markedly inhibited by nicardipine (10 microM) and omega-AgTX IVA (100 nM). In contrast, omega-CgTX GVIA (1 microM) was not as effective in altering increases in Cm. 4. From negative (-80 mV) and depolarized (-40 mV) holding potentials, both peak and plateau ICa were inhibited by the presence of LES antibodies (1 mg ml-1 IgG). LES serum also reduced depolarization-induced increases in Cm by 48% (n = 15). 5. To determine whether the LES antibodies are downregulating a specific type(s) of Ca2+ channel, nicardipine (10 microM), omega-CgTX GVIA (1 microM) or omega-AgTX IVA (100 nM) was applied to tumour cells that had been previously exposed to LES serum for 24 h. The most pronounced change was that omega-AgTX IVA was 38-84% less effective at reducing ICa after the IgG treatment. The effectiveness of nicardipine was diminished by 18% after incubation with the LES antibodies, whereas the omega-CgTX GVIA was seen to be more effective. These results suggest that LES IgG downregulates P-type Ca2+ channels and, possibly, to a lesser extent L-type channels. 6. In view of recent evidence that P-type Ca2+ channels mediate cholinergic transmitter release at the mammalian neuromuscular junction (NMJ), the expression of P-type Ca2+ channels in the SCLC cells and the reactivity of LES IgG with these channels support the hypothesis that P-type Ca2+ channels in these cancer cells may trigger the autoantibody production in this disorder. The antibodies so produced are implicated in the functional impairment of the Ca2+ channels characteristic of LES.

We reported that 43% of patients with Lambert-Eaton myasthenic syndrome (LEMS) and small cell lung cancer (SCLC) had an antibody called anti-glial nuclear antibody (AGNA), defined by the immunoreaction with the nuclei of the Bergmann glia of the cerebellum. This study was undertaken to identify the antigen recognized by AGNA and to confirm the association with paraneoplastic LEMS in a larger series. We probed a fetal brain cDNA library with AGNA-positive sera. The presence of antibodies against the isolated antigen was detected by immunoblot of phage plaques from two positive clones. We studied 105 patients with LEMS (55 with SCLC), 50 with paraneoplastic neurologic syndromes, SCLC, and Hu antibodies, and 50 with only SCLC. Probing of the fetal brain expression library with AGNA sera resulted in the isolation of SOX1, a highly immunogenic tumor antigen in SCLC. IgG eluted from SOX1 clones produced the same cerebellar immunoreactivity as of AGNA sera. SOX1 antibodies were present in 64% of patients with LEMS and SCLC but in none of the 50 with idiopathic LEMS (p < 0.0001). Compared with paraneoplastic LEMS, the frequency of SOX1 antibodies was significantly lower in patients with Hu antibodies (32%, p = 0.002) and in those with only SCLC (22%). SOX1 is the antigen recognized by anti-glial nuclear antibody-positive sera. The detection of SOX1 antibodies in patients with Lambert-Eaton myasthenic syndrome (LEMS) predicts the presence of small cell lung cancer and may be used to follow more closely those LEMS patients with no evidence of cancer at the initial workup.

Lambert-Eaton myasthenic syndrome (LEMS) is a rare type of neuromusculer conduction disorder. This disease can be seen with lung cancer and, it is associated with otoimmunity. Among the symptoms of lung cancer LEMS can be seen, but it is very rare. In this case, LEMS symptoms were analyzed before lung cancer symptoms. The localization of the tumor was near the pulmonary artery. By the early diagnose, the patient had the chance of cure.

The Lambert-Eaton myasthenic syndrome (LEMS) is an autoimmune disease in which autoantibodies are directed against voltage-gated calcium channels (VGCCs) at presynaptic nerve terminals. We first demonstrated the presence of P/Q-type and N-type VGCCs in digitonin extracts prepared from human and rabbit cerebellum using the specific ligands 125I-omega-conotoxin MVIIC (125I-omega-CmTx) and 125I-omega-conotoxin GVIA (125I-omega-CgTx), respectively. We then tested sera from 72 LEMS patients' 25 with proven small cell lung cancer (SCLC) and 66 healthy or other neurological, SCLC or autoimmune disease controls in an immunoprecipitation assay using 125I-omega-CmTx-labelled (P/Q-type) VGCCs in human cerebellar extract. Sixty-six of 72 LEMS serum samples (91.7%) were positive for the presence of VGCC antibodies, as defined as a titre greater than 3 standard deviations above the mean for the healthy controls (n = 22). Rabbit cerebellar extract as antigen gave similar results (r = 0.94, P < 0.001, n = 30). By contrast, only 24/72 (33%) LEMS sera were positive in the assay for anti-N-type VGCC antibodies using 125I-omega-CgTx. All these 24 were also positive in the 125I-omega-CmTx assay. All healthy and disease control sera were negative in both assays. The anti-P/Q-type VGCC antibody titres did not correlate with an electrophysiological index of disease severity across individuals; however, longitudinal studies in a LEMS patient with SCLC receiving chemotherapy, and in a non-SCLC LEMS patient receiving immunosuppressive therapy showed an inverse relation between antibody titre and disease severity. These results support the view that anti-P/Q-type VGCC antibodies are implicated in the motor disorder in LEMS, and show that the omega-CmTx radioimmunoassay is a highly specific and sensitive means of detecting them.

We have used human beta 2 and beta 4 cDNA probes to map the genes encoding two isoforms of the regulatory beta subunit of voltage-activated Ca2+ channels, viz. CACNB2 (beta 2) and CACNB4 (beta 4), to human chromosomes 10p12 and 2q22-q23, respectively, by fluorescence in situ hybridization. The gene encoding the beta 2 protein, first described as a Lambert-Eaton myasthenic syndrome (LEMS) antigen in humans, is found close to a region that undergoes chromosome rearrangements in small cell lung cancer, which occurs in association with LEMS. CACNB2 (beta 2) and CACNB4 (beta 4) genes are members of the ion-channel gene superfamily and it should now be possible to examine their loci by linkage analysis of ion-channel-related disorders. To date, no such disease-related gene has been assigned to 10p12 and 2q22-q23.

We report the case of a 50-year-old man with paraneoplastic cerebellar degeneration (PCD) and Lambert-Eaton myasthenic syndrome (LEMS) associated with primary double lung cancer. He developed acute progressive double vision, slurred speech, and gait disturbance. Neurological examination revealed diplopia, mild ptosis, bilateral horizontal gaze-evoked nystagmus, and cerebellar limb and truncal ataxia. The diffusion image of brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) revealed no abnormal findings in the cerebellum. On the basis of the diagnosis of acute cerebelitis, he was given methylprednisolone pulse therapy followed by oral prednisolone, which gradually improved his neurological signs and symptoms. The analysis of the possible etiology suggested that the PCD was induced by lung cancer, which led to ataxia. A chest computed tomography scan revealed mass lesions of irregular shape and unclear margins in the upper lobe of the right lung and a small nodule tumor in the upper lobe of the left lung. We performed transbronchial needle aspiration and detected the bronchioloalveolar carcinoma of the right lung. An electromyogram showed waxing phenomenon in the ulnar nerve at high-frequency (50Hz) stimulation. The serum levels of anti-P/Q-type voltage-gated calcium channel (VGCC) antibody were elavated in the patient. These findings confirmed that the pathogenesis of the condition of this patient to be associated with LEMS. His cerebellar symptoms were considered to be caused by the PCD, and the diplopia, ptosis, and hyporeflexia were attributed to LEMS. We performed upper left lobectomy with mediastinal lymphnode dissection via video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery. A histological study detected small cell carcinoma. A diagnosis of double primary lung cancer was made. Physicians need to be aware that patients may develop PCD and LEMS associated with anti-VGCC antibody caused by small cell lung cancer, and a mass survey should be conducted and careful examinations performed.

Lambert-Eaton syndrome is a myasthenia-like syndrome of paraneoplastic origin which is often associated with anaplastic small-cell lung cancer. It seems to be an autoimmune disease responsible for a deficit of acetylcholine ejection in the motor end plate. On the occasion of two recent cases, we review the clinical, physiopathological and diagnostic aspects of this paraneoplastic syndrome.

Utilizing the whole-cell patch-clamp method we assessed the Ca2+ current (ICa) in well-established cell lines from human small-cell carcinoma (SCC) of the lung, NCI-H209 and NCI-H187. The Ca2+ current was readily observed in H209 tumour cells (90% of the cells tested), whereas H187 tumour cells only occasionally expressed Ca2+ channels (26% of the cells tested). H209 Ca2+ current was evoked by potentials greater than -30 mV and exhibited partial inactivation over the duration of a 40 ms command potential. This inward current was unchanged by alteration of the holding potential from -80 to -40 mV and the activation phase of the Ca2+ current was best fitted by Hodgkin-Huxley m(t)2 kinetics. H209 Ca2+ current was reduced over 80% by verapamil (100 microM), whereas w-conotoxin (5 microM) appeared to be without effect. In contrast, H209 Ca2+ current was rapidly abolished by nifedipine (10 microM), strongly suggesting the presence of L-type Ca2+ channels. Voltage-gated Ca2+ channels may be important to the secretion of ectopic hormones and the etiology and pathogenesis of Lambert-Eaton syndrome, an autoimmune disorder of the motor nerve terminal in which autoantibodies directed against voltage-gated Ca2+ channels are produced.

LES is an autoimmune disorder of the neuromuscular junction in which autoantibodies directed against voltage-dependent Ca2+ channels block nerve-evoked Ca2+ entry at the motor nerve terminal. The pathogenic IgG is likely to produce a similar inhibitory effect on the Ca2+ channel function in other cholinergic synapses of the autonomic nervous system. This pathophysiology is sufficient to account for the distinctive clinical, immunologic, and electrophysiologic manifestations in patients with LES. Etiology of this disease is uncertain but in view of its frequent association with small cell lung cancer, this specific type of neoplasm may be implicated in the initiation of autoimmune response. Recent studies indeed support the possibility that the antigenic stimulus in the neoplastic form of LES may arise from voltage-dependent Ca2+ channels found in the lung cancer cells.

Neuromuscular symptoms in patients with Lambert-Eaton myasthenic syndrome (LEMS) and a small cell lung cancer (SCLC) develop more rapidly than in LEMS patients without a SCLC. We studied how this clinical information, which is readily available at the first consultation, can be used to predict the presence of SCLC. In our study we included 52 LEMS patients with SCLC and 45 non-tumor patients (NT-LEMS). We interviewed patients using a structured checklist and reviewed their clinical records. We compared frequency and onset of symptoms during the course of LEMS. In the first six months, over half the SCLC-LEMS patients had developed seven separate symptoms, while NT-LEMS patients developed only two symptoms. Proximal leg weakness and dry mouth were early symptoms in both groups. Rapid involvement of proximal arm muscles (p=0.0001), distal arm muscles (p=0.0037), distal leg muscles (p=0.0002), dysartria (p=0.0091) and the presence of erectile dysfunction (p=0.007) were found significantly more often in SCLC-LEMS patients in both cohorts. Cerebellar symptoms, although present in 9% of LEMS patients, were almost exclusively related to SCLC-LEMS. A rapidly progressive course of disease from onset in LEMS patients should raise a high suspicion of SCLC. Special attention should be paid to involvement of upper extremities, involvement of distal arm and distal leg muscles, to erectile dysfunction and probably ataxia in order to discriminate between SCLC-LEMS and NT-LEMS.

Paraneoplastic cerebellar degeneration may occur in association with Lambert-Eaton myasthenic syndrome (LEMS), but to our knowledge, the co-occurrence of paraneoplastic opsoclonus-myoclonus syndrome and LEMS has not been previously reported. A 67-year-old woman presented with a complex partial seizure and evolving ocular flutter, opsoclonus, myoclonus and 'cerebellar' signs, all of which improved spontaneously within 6 weeks. Approximately 8 weeks after symptom onset, the patient became encephalopathic, she had a further complex partial seizure, and she became areflexic with potentiation of deep tendon reflexes. Radiological, bronchoscopic and histological investigations revealed small-cell lung cancer, and neurophysiological investigations confirmed a diagnosis of LEMS. High-titre anti-P/Q-type voltage-gated calcium-channel antibodies were identified in the serum, which increased as the signs of opsoclonus and myoclonus resolved. The encephalopathy and clinical features of LEMS responded dramatically to chemotherapy and radiotherapy. Spontaneous improvement of paraneoplastic opsoclonus-myoclonus syndrome may occur, and this syndrome may occur in association with LEMS. Antivoltage-gated calcium-channel antibodies are not implicated in the pathogenesis of paraneoplastic opsoclonus-myoclonus syndrome.

We report a case of neuromuscular disease overlap between myasthenia gravis and Lambert-Eaton syndrome (LES). Clinical features were those of LES and occurred insidiously in this 68-year old man: proximal weakness predominant in the lower limbs, generalized areflexia, dryness of the mouth and partial right eye palsy. Investigations disclosed a small cell lung cancer. On the other hand, an electrophysiological study showed low amplitude of all motor evoked potentials, and significant decrement in the median nerve at repeated 3 Hz stimulation, but failed to disclose any increment of the motor evoked potential in abductor digiti minimi pedis muscle after both maximal voluntary contraction and repeated 20 Hz stimulation. In addition, the patient improved under anticholinesterase drugs, but failed to respond to guanidine. Titres for both anti-acetylcholine-receptor antibodies and calcium channel antibodies were negative. The relationship between our case and recently reported cases of co-existence of the Lambert-Eaton myasthenic syndrome and myasthenia gravis is discussed.

Lambert-Eaton myasthenic syndrome (LEMS) developed in a patient with presumed chronic inflammatory demyelinating polyneuropathy (CIDP) and negative chest CT. Since antibodies against both Hu and voltage-gated calcium channel (VGCC) were detected, repeated chest CT was performed, which eventually showed a pulmonary mass lesion. Biopsy revealed small cell lung cancer (SCLC) indicating the importance of repeated chest CT in LEMS even when an existing autoimmune-like disease and negative CT may suggest an autoimmune origin. This is the first report of paraneoplastic CIDP and LEMS associated with anti-Hu, anti-VGCC and SCLC.

Brain FDG-PET after radiation therapy is classically used to differentiate between tumor recurrence and radiation-related tumor necrosis. Little is known about FDG-PET in patients with radiation-induced leukoencephalopathy without radiological aspect of necrosis. We present a 69-year-old woman who had preventive whole brain radiation after a diagnosis of paraneoplastic Lambert-Eaton syndrome related to small cell lung cancer Five months after radiation therapy, she developed radiation-induced leukoencephalopathy manifested by ataxia. Profound cerebellar hypometabolism on FDG-PET was in contrast with the presence of only discrete cerebellar white matter changes on MRI. FDG-PET abnormalities seem to correlate better with clinical signs related to radiation-associated brain toxicity than MRI.

Lambert-Eaton myasthenic syndrome (LEMS) is a paraneoplastic autoimmune disorder caused by an IgG-mediated reduction in number of presynaptic voltage-gated calcium channels (VGCC) at the neuromuscular junction. In at least 50% of cases, the stimulus for antibody production may be VGCC on small cell lung cancer (SCLC). In this study membranes isolated from a human small cell lung cancer xenograft (Mar), that bound [3H]PN200-110, a VGCC antagonist, were subjected to Western blotting using plasma from 12 LEMS patients and eight controls. Although one band recognised by 3/12 LEMS IgGs might be associated with the VGCC, a number of other proteins were recognised both by LEMS plasma, and by plasma from patients with other disorders. The results illustrate the difficulties found using Western blotting with autoimmune plasma to identify specific polypeptides in a crude antigen preparation.

The clinical and electrophysiological data of 18 consecutive adult patients with paraneoplastic Lambert-Eaton myasthenic syndrome (LMES) have been reviewed. The cancer associated with LEMS was small-cell lung carcinoma (SCLC) in 15 cases and epidermoid lung carcinoma in 3 cases. The main clinical neurological features were proximal lower limb weakness (100%), depressed tendon reflexes (94%) and dryness of the mouth (66%). The results of repetitive nerve stimulation (RNS) were not statistically different in the paraneoplastic LEMS group and in a group of 6 LMS patients in whom no carcinoma had been detected. Low-amplitude compound muscle action potential (CMAP) was present in all cases; decremental response at low stimulation rates was present in 13/15 cases. An abnormal incremental response at high stimulation rates was observed in all cases. A close correlation between CMAP amplitude and clinical condition was found in 4 cases during the long-term follow-up. In one patient the RNS electrical pattern could be misinterpreted as myasthenia gravis in only one muscle tested. We underline the usefulness of a 50 Hz stimulation during 4 seconds to establish the diagnosis unequivocally, and that of post-exercise facilitation in routine detection among an SCLC population. Our results suggest that CAMP amplitude and RNS test could be used to evaluate the short-term improvement of LMS under treatment and, in some cases, for the long-term follow-up. The infraclinical axonal neuropathy detected in 8 patients probably was another associated autoimmune paraneoplastic complication.

We report a case of paraneoplastic myasthenic syndrome with clinical features suggesting Lambert Eaton syndrome but without the electromyographic elements required for diagnosis. Anti-calcium channel antibodies were also lacking. The electromyogram evidenced a block and the Tensilon test was positive. The efficacy of anticholinesterases argued in favor of myasthenia but anti-acetylcholine receptor antibodies were negative. The block was more of a mixed nature, involving both presynaptic transmission as in Lambert Eaton syndrome and post-synaptic transmission as in paraneoplastic myasthenia. The primary tumor was identified as a small-cell neuroendocrine lung carcinoma on mediastinal biopsies obtained directly on CT-scan guided puncture of a mediastinal node. Thoracotomy was thus avoided. The Lambert Eaton syndrome is a paraneoplastic manifestation of small-cell lung cancer in 50% of the cases unlike generalized myasthenia which apparently is never associated with small-cell lung cancer. A mixed paraneoplastic neuro-muscle junction disorder with aspects of each can be exceptionally observed.

Sodium channels of human small-cell lung cancer (SCLC) cells were examined with whole-cell and single-channel patch clamp methods. In the tumor cells from SCLC cell line NCI-H146, the majority of the voltage-gated Na+ channels are only weakly tetrodotoxin (TTX)-sensitive (Kd = 215 nM). With the membrane potential maintained at -60 to -80 mV, these cells produced all-or-nothing action potentials in response to depolarizing current injection (> 20 pA). Similar all-or-nothing spikes were also observed with anodal break excitation. Removal of external Ca2+ did not affect the action potential production, whereas 5 microM TTX or substitution of Na+ with choline abolished it. Action potentials elicited in the Ca(2+)-free condition were reversibly blocked by 4 mM MnCl2 due to the Mn(2+)-induced inhibition of voltage-dependent sodium currents (INa). Therefore, Na+ channels, not Ca2+ channels, underlie the excitability of SCLC cells. Whole-cell INa was maximal with step-depolarizing stimulations to 0 mV, and reversed at +45.2 mV, in accord with the predicted Nernst equilibrium potential for a Na(+)-selective channel. INa evoked by depolarizing test potentials (-60 to +40 mV) exhibited a transient time course and activation/inactivation kinetics typical of neuronal excitable membranes; the plot of the Hodgkin-Huxley parameters, m infinity and h infinity, also revealed biophysical similarity between SCLC and neuronal Na+ channels. The single channel current amplitude, as measured with the inside-out patch configuration, was 1.0 pA at -20 mV with a slope conductance of 12.1 pS. The autoantibodies implicated in the Lambert-Eaton myasthenic syndrome (LES), which are known to inhibit ICa and INa in bovine adrenal chromaffin cells, also significantly inhibited INa in SCLC cells. These results indicate that (i) action potentials in human SCLC cells result from the regenerative increase in voltage-gated Na+ channel conductance; (ii) fundamental characteristics of SCLC Na+ channels are the same as the classical sodium channels found in a variety of excitable cells; and (iii) in some LES patients, SCLC Na+ channels are an additional target of the pathological IgG present in the patients' sera.

Paraneoplastic Lambert-Eaton myasthenia syndrome is presented in two cases with small cell lung cancer. An increase of serum cholinesterase activity was explained by induced release of biologically active proteins by neoplastic tissue.

To enhance the acknowledgement of Lambert-Eaton syndrome in patients with small cell lung cancer. Retrospective case analysis of Lambert-Eaton syndrome in patients with small cell lung cancer in our hospital. The characteristics of electromyography for Lambert-Eaton syndrome was reduction in action potential amplitude after repetitive peripheral nerve stimulation at low frequency and increased amplitude at high frequency.There were 10 cases of Lambert-Eaton syndrome in 332 pathologically diagnosed small cell lung cancer,9 male and 1 female with an average age of 57.6±4.9.Nine of 10 cases were among 50 to 69.All patients except one experienced myasthenia,mainly in lower extremities,2 to 36 months (median:6 months) before the diagnosis of small cell lung cancer.Treatment of small cell lung cancer may improve the symptoms of Lambert-Eaton syndrome. Improving the recognition of Lambert-Eaton syndrome may be helpful to identify early small cell lung cancer and improve the prognosis,as the symptom of muscular weakness usually appears early before the diagnosis of small cell lung cancer.

Lambert-Eaton syndrome (LES) is an immune-mediated disorder of the presynaptic neuromuscular junction due to the blocking effect of the voltage-gated calcium channel (VGCC) antibodies. Small-cell lung cancer (SCLC) is the most common cause of LES. We report an unusual case of LES associated with large-cell neuroendocrine carcinoma (LCNEC) of the lung. In this case, clinical symptoms of LES predated the diagnosis of LCNEC by 6 years. After tumor resection, the patient experienced clinical and electrophysiological improvement. In addition, he had a decrease in VGCC antibody titer from 130 to 80 pmol/L. The onset of LES can be prolonged, and tumor surveillance should continue in these cases.

A patient with the Lambert-Eaton syndrome (LES) and small cell lung cancer developed respiratory failure several hours after verapamil was given. Improvement in respiratory function did not occur when guanidine was given, but was delayed until verapamil was discontinued 3 days later. Although other factors may have contributed to the clinical deterioration of our patient, the temporal relationship to verapamil and the theoretical danger of calcium channel blockade lead us to believe that the drug should be used cautiously in LES.

Plasma from patients with Lambert-Eaton myasthenic syndrome (LEMS), an autoimmune disease of neuromuscular transmission, contains antibodies that bind to the synaptic vesicle protein synaptotagmin. Synaptotagmin associates with calcium channels and appears to regulate synaptic vesicle docking at the plasma membrane prior to rapid neurotransmitter release. Autoantibodies directed against a synaptotagmin-calcium channel complex may be involved in the etiology of LEMS. In the majority of patients LEMS is associated with small cell lung cancer (SCLC). We have detected the expression of proteins of the secretory pathway, including synaptotagmin, syntaxin and N-type calcium channels, in a panel of SCLC tumor lines. These observations are compatible with the hypothesis that the initial autoimmune response in LEMS is triggered by the tumor.

We studied whether a difference exists in the development of symptoms of the Lambert-Eaton myasthenic syndrome (LEMS) between patients with or without small cell lung cancer (SCLC). We assessed symptoms in 38 LEMS patients, 13 with SCLC, by interviewing them using a structured checklist, backed up by a review of their clinical records, and compared the frequency and time scale of symptoms during the course of LEMS. Bulbar (87%) and autonomic (95%) symptoms for the whole group were more common than reported in the literature. Frequencies of symptoms did not differ significantly between patients with and without SCLC, but symptoms in patients with SCLC appeared within a shorter time-frame, indicating a more rapid clinical course. The presence of a particular symptom associated with LEMS did not predict the presence of SCLC, but in patients with rapidly progressive LEMS the possibility of underlying lung cancer should be of particular concern.

The diagnosis and treatment of the neurological paraneoplastic syndromes associated with lung cancer can pose a challenge both to general physicians and neurologists as well as pulmonologists. A 53 year-old heavy smoker presented with a Lambert-Eaton myasthenic syndrome (LEMS). Bronchoscopy was normal but radiological examinations revealed a lymph node in site 4R. The pathological diagnosis after mediastinoscopy was negative. Twenty-five months later, an opacity on chest X-ray led to a biopsy which revealed a squamous cell carcinoma. A lobectomy was performed for a pT2N0M0 lesion. A significant improvement of neurological symptoms was seen. The myasthenic syndrome reappeared 21 months later. A local and general relapse was diagnosed. The patient died 10 months later despite chemotherapy. LEMS occurs because of an immunological reaction against voltage-dependent calcium channels. LEMS is generally associated with small cell lung cancer occurring in three percent of cases. However, the case that we report shows the unusual association of LEMS with non small-cell lung cancer and highlights the difficulties associated in the management of this condition.

Lambert-Eaton myasthenic syndrome (LEMS) is a neuromuscular disorder characterized by defective neurotransmitter release at presynaptic terminals. It is caused by an IgG autoantibody reacting against voltage-gated calcium channels. Severe LEMS complicated by ventilatory failure is rare. We report a case of small-cell lung cancer (SCLC) presenting with LEMS and ventilatory failure in a 67-year-old man who initially presented with progressive limb weakness for 6 months and tachypnea with shallow breathing for 1 week. LEMS was diagnosed through electrophysiologic studies. Chest radiography and computerized tomography showed a huge mass lesion over the left anterior and middle mediastinum with an encasement of the left pulmonary artery. Cytologic examination of ultrasound-guided fine needle aspiration disclosed SCLC. Successful treatment in combination with plasma exchange and chemotherapy resulted in dramatic tumor regression and LEMS remission, which were confirmed by chest radiography and electrophysiologic studies. This case suggests that plasma exchange and chemotherapy can be effective in treating SCLC with severe LEMS that produces ventilatory failure.

The sera of patients with Lambert-Eaton myasthenic syndrome (LEMS) contain autoantibodies against several extracellular and intracellular components of the voltage-gated calcium channel (VGCC)/synaptic vesicle release complex. An example of the latter are anti-beta-subunit antibodies (anti-MysB antibodies). We constructed a full-length cDNA clone of a human VGCC beta-subunit to produce purified beta-subunit fusion protein (MysB protein). Using this protein, we demonstrated that anti-beta-subunit antibodies are present in the sera of 23% of LEMS patients and only, in low titer, in 2% of small cell lung cancer patients without LEMS. The presence of anti-beta-subunit antibodies was closely associated with high titers of P/Q- and N-type VGCC antibodies. Immunization of rats with the purified MysB protein induced high antibody titers, but no signs of neurologic dysfunction were found. We conclude that anti-beta-subunit antibodies are not likely to interfere with ion channel function, but their presence could explain the cross-reactivity of LEMS sera with several subtypes of VGCCs and the lack of correlation between anti-VGCC antibody titer and clinical severity of disease.

Plasma and IgG obtained from 10 Lambert-Eaton myasthenic syndrome (LES) patients (5 with carcinoma, 5 without associated cancer), 6 healthy subjects, and 1 patient with small-cell lung cancer (SCLC) were examined in their ability to recognize chromaffin cell antigens on Western blots. The pattern of antigen recognition was compared with the magnitude of inhibition of voltage-dependent calcium and sodium currents recorded with the patch-clamp technique from chromaffin cells. Eight of the 11 patients with LES and/or SCLC recognized plasma membrane proteins and 9 of the patients' IgG interacted with cytoplasmic antigens with no apparent pattern of antigen recognition between patients. Also, there was no obvious band pattern distinguishing patients with LES from those with LES and concurrent SCLC. Eighty percent of the LES patients' antibodies were capable of reducing the calcium current (ICa) in chromaffin cells. One of the novel findings of this study is that 30% of the patients had produced antibodies which were able to inhibit both calcium and sodium currents (INa). The heterogeneous response of the IgG on the Western blots does not appear to correlate with the efficacy of reducing the inward currents.

In the nervous system, voltage-gated Ca2+ channels regulate numerous processes critical to neuronal function including secretion of neurotransmitters, initiation of action potentials in dendritic regions of some neurons, growth cone elongation, and gene expression. Because of the critical role which Ca2+ channels play in signaling processes within the nervous system, disruption of their function will lead to profound disturbances in neuronal function. Voltage-gated Ca2+ channels are the targets of several relatively rare neurological or neuromuscular diseases resulting from spontaneously-occurring mutations in genes encoding for parts of the channel proteins, or from autoimmune attack on the channel protein responses. Mutations in CACNAIA, which encodes for the alpha1A subunit of P/Q-type Ca2+ channels, lead to symptoms seen in familial hemiplegic migraine, episodic ataxia type 2, and spinocerebellar ataxia type 6. Conversely, autoimmune attack on Ca2+ channels at motor axon terminals causes peripheral cholinergic nerve dysfunction observed in Lambert-Eaton Myasthenic Syndrome (LEMS), the best studied of the disorders targeting voltage-gated Ca2+ channels. LEMS is characterized by decreased evoked quantal release of acetylcholine (ACh) and disruption of the presynaptic active zones, the sites at which ACh is thought to be released. LEMS is generally believed to be due to circulating antibodies directed specifically at the Ca2+ channels located at or near the active zone of motor nerve terminals (P/Q-type) and hence involved in the release of ACh. However, other presynaptic proteins have also been postulated to be targets of the autoantibodies. LEMS has a high degree of coincidence (approximately 60%) with small cell lung cancer; the remaining 40% of patients with LEMS have no detectable tumor. Diagnosis of LEMS relies on characteristic patterns of electromyographic changes; these changes are observable at neuromuscular junctions of muscle biopsies from patients with LEMS. In the majority of LEMS patients, those having detectable tumor, the disease is thought to occur as a result of immune response directed initially against voltage-gated Ca2+ channels found on the lung tumor cells. In these patients, effective treatment of the underlying tumor generally causes marked improvement of the symptoms of LEMS as well. Animal models of LEMS can be generated by chronic administration of plasma, serum or immunoglobulin G to mice. These models have helped dramatically in our understanding of the pathogenesis of LEMS. This "passive transfer" model mimics the electrophysiological and ultrastructural findings seen in muscle biopsies of patients with LEMS. In this model, we have shown that the reduction in amplitude of Ca2+ currents through P/Q-type channels is followed by "unmasking" of an L-type Ca2+ current not normally found at the motor nerve terminal which participates in release of ACh from terminals of mice treated with plasma from patients with LEMS. It is unclear what mechanisms underlie the development of this novel L-type Ca2+ current involved in release of ACh at motor nerve terminals during passive transfer of LEMS.

Lambert-Eaton myasthenic syndrome (LEMS) is one of the neurologic paraneoplastic syndromes often found in patients with lung cancer. It is characterized by a generalized deficit of neurotransmitter release. Patients with small cell lung cancer (SCLC) in particular may develop LEMS, and SCLC is very often detected in patients affected by LEMS. LEMS is an autoimmune disease, and autoantibodies that interfere with neurotransmitter release by binding to presynaptic voltage-operated calcium channels (VOCCs) have been found in sera of patients with LEMS. Both human neuronal and SCLC cell lines express omega-conotoxin-sensitive VOCCs, and autoantibodies from patients affected by LEMS can precipitate these channels. We have now screened a large population of patients and control subjects in order to define the specificity and sensitivity of the anti-VOCC antibody assay. We have tested sera from 52 patients with LEMS with and without SCLC; 32 sera from patients with SCLC without LEMS, 31 from patients with non-SCLC, 34 from patients with inflammatory lung diseases, 17 from patients with other neurologic disorders, and 48 from healthy control subjects. We have found that a positive result with this radioimmunoassay is highly specific for LEMS, with or without SCLC, when the antibody titer is higher than 14.21 pM. Anti-VOCC antibodies have also been found in about 40% of patients with SCLC without LEMS, but they were absent in all the other populations tested. We can conclude that this serologic assay is a very useful aid in the diagnosis of LEMS, and it might be useful also for the early diagnosis of SCLC.

Thirty years ago, antibodies against the muscle acetylcholine receptor (AChR) were recognized as the cause of myasthenia gravis. Since then, there has been great interest in identifying other neurological disorders associated with autoantibodies. Several other antibody-mediated neuromuscular disorders have been identified, each associated with an antibody against a ligand- or voltage-gated ion channel. The Lambert-Eaton syndrome is caused by antibodies against voltage-gated calcium channels and often occurs in patients with small cell lung cancer. Acquired neuromyotonia is caused by voltage-gated potassium channel antibodies, and autoimmune autonomic ganglionopathy is caused by antibodies against the neuronal AChR in autonomic ganglia. There is good evidence that antibodies in these disorders cause changes in synaptic function or neuronal excitability by directly inhibiting ion channel function. More recently, studies have identified ion channel antibodies in patients with certain CNS disorders, such as steroid-responsive encephalitis and paraneoplastic cerebellar ataxia. It remains unclear if antibodies can gain access to the CNS and directly cause ion channel dysfunction. Treatment of autoimmune channelopathies includes drugs that help restore normal neuronal function and treatments to remove pathogenic antibodies (plasma exchange) or modulate the immune response (steroids or immunosuppressants). These disabling neurological disorders may be dramatically responsive to immunomodulatory therapy. Future studies will likely lead to identification of other ion channel antibodies and other autoimmune channelopathies.
