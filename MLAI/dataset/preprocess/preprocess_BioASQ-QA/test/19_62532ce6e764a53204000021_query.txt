Facial musculature is divided into masticatory muscles, i.e. M. masseter and M. buccalis, with bony insertions and smaller facial muscles involved in facial expression, which insert into bone and skin. There are four fixed osteocutaneous points of the face, i.e. zygomatic (Mac Gregor), mandibular (Furnas), orbital (Psillakis), and masseteric with an antigravitational effect and functional role in facial expression (1,2). In other body parts, the direct insertion of muscle fibers into skin has not been reported. In the neck-shoulder region, direct insertion of skeletal muscles into the skin can be observed during surgery in this area. We observed this phenomenon in 3 adult male patients (51-65 years old) during lipoma surgery. In our case series, lipomas were of the superficial subcutaneous type. After local anesthesia with 1% ropivacain, a fusiform skin incision was followed by en bloc resection of the lipoma. During resection, we became aware that muscle fibers of M. levator scapulae inserted into the back skin (Figure 1). This has practical implications for surgery because of possible pain when these fibers need to be cut to deliver a lipoma or other subcutaneous tumors. Lipomas are a common benign tumor of the subcutaneous adipose tissue, known as the superficial type. However, lipomas may occur intramuscularly, intermuscularly, parostealy and intra-osseously (3). In the deep subtypes of lipoma, pain and discomfort may be a leading clinical symptom whereas superficial lipomas often are asymptomatic (4,5). Surgery is the treatment of choice, while liposuction and laser-lipolysis are alternatives (6). During surgery of lipomas of the shoulder/neck region, direct insertion of muscle fibers of M. levator scapulae into skin was noted - an observation possibly underreported in surgical literature.

Since experimental and clinical evidence supports some role of musculature in determining the form and size of facial bones during the active periods of growth after birth, this study addresses the same basic relationships between muscle and bone during the periods of active growth before birth. The relationship between the masseter muscle and the mandible, including its ramal and body components, was chosen as the model for study in nineteen human fetuses (ages 16 to 36 weeks). Cross-sectional cephalometric data indicated that, although increases in the size of the muscle and mandible were linearly related to increasing age, the ramal portion of the mandible was more closely related to changes in the masseter muscle than to changes in the mandibular body. Moreover, it appears that reorientation of the muscle anteriorly and downward precedes a similar reorientation of the ramus, with the combination of both fetal events leading to the typical relationships of the two structures expected after birth. Although this study does not get to cause-and-effect relationships, and although the fetal specimens cannot be monitored longitudinally over time, the parallelisms between our prenatal findings and those reported for postnatal periods certainly lend further support to the observation that many aspects of morphogenesis and growth are continual processes spanning the periods on either side of birth.

Masticatory and bite forces, when applied to the teeth, generate tremendous compressive energy in the temporomandibular joint (TMJ). Excessive 'TMJ loading', if left untreated, deteriorates articular functions. Normally, it is controlled, to a certain extent, by stomatognathic means. In an attempt to clarify this control mechanism, we analyzed the relationship between TMJ loading and the activities of the masticatory muscles, by employing a static two-dimensional jaw model. This comprises two rigid bodies, the upper and lower jaws, including three dominant muscles, i.e. the masseter, the anterior portion of the temporalis and the lateral pterygoid. Static equilibrium analyses determined that TMJ loading can be minimized, under controlled bite conditions, by pointing the loading vector in a direction solely indicated by individual morphological factors, such as the position and orientation of the masseter and the temporalis. This theoretically optimum direction of TMJ loading was also anatomically acceptable, because the load is applied exactly to those portions of the articular disk and mandibular head that can most easily sustain it. Interestingly, this factor was absolutely independent of both the activities of the lateral pterygoid and the direction of bite force. Consequently. TMI loading can be minimized, by coordinating the activities of the masseter and the anterior portion of the temporalis.

The masseter muscle is an integral part of the oral facial complex and one of the muscles of mastication. It functions with the other masticatory muscles in moving and posturing the mandible and in verbalizing, eating and swallowing. When a patient has temporomandibular dysfunction (TMD) or a myogenic disorder, the integrity of the masseter muscle can be compromised resulting in pain, malfunction, inflammation and/or swelling. A careful evaluation of the masseter muscles is necessary in facial pain patients since the pain can originate from a distant site and be referred to this area. One of the little known disorders involving the masseter and its tendinous origin is tenomyositis, in which an inflammation of the muscle and its tendon occurs. In this retrospective study, the charts of 114 consecutive patients (N = 114) were evaluated to determine the prevalence of this disorder and the reported etiology.

Hemangiomas are benign vascular tumors, of unknown origin. Skeletal muscle localization account for less than 1% of cases. Masseter muscle localization is most common in head and neck (36%). In this case, treatment is usually surgery via an extra-oral approach which imposes parotidectomy with dissection of facial nerve branches. We report a case of intramasseteric hemangioma operated via an intraoral approach and we describe the benefits of this approach. A 34-year-old male patient with no prior history of trauma consulted for left masseter swelling having evolved for several years. Clinical examination revealed a soft, painless, well-defined swelling, about 5cm long, with a positive Wattle sign in the left cheek. The CT exam suggested a vascular lesion, located in the deep bundle of the masseter muscle. Preoperative embolization was followed by surgical exeresis via an intraoral approach. The post-operative evolution was uneventful. No recurrence was observed at one year of follow-up. Intraoral intramasseteric hemangioma exeresis is possible and does not seem to lead to more complications than with the facial approach. It prevents the significant drawbacks due to cutaneous incision, parotidectomy, and dissection of facial nerve branches via a facial approach.

Structure and function are reviewed in the masticatory muscles and in the muscles of the lower face and tongue. The enormous strength of jaw closure is in large part due to the pinnated arrangement of the muscle fibres in the masseter. This muscle, like other masticatory muscles, is unusual in that the cell bodies of the muscle spindle afferents lie in the brain stem rather than in an external ganglion; spindles are absent in the lower facial muscles. Although few data are available, the numbers of motor units in the masticatory muscles, and probably in the lower facial muscles also, appear to be much greater than in limb muscles. The motor units in the facial and tongue muscles are largely composed of histochemical type II ('fast-twitch') fibres, but in the masticatory muscles there are substantial numbers of fibres intermediate between type I ('slow twitch') and type II, and fibre type grouping is present. In comparison with limb muscles, there is little information on ageing changes in oro-facial muscles. The masticatory muscles do, however, show some atrophy and loss of X-ray density, while motor unit twitches are prolonged. Strength is reduced in the tongue and masticatory muscles. It is known that limb muscle properties are largely governed by their innervation, both through the pattern and amount of impulse activity, and the delivery of trophic messengers; the situation for oro-facial muscles is unclear. The structural and functional differences between the two types of muscle indicate the need for conducting ageing studies on the oro-facial muscles, rather than relying on extrapolations from limb muscles.

Intramuscular hemangioma, is a distinctive type of vascular tumor occurring within the skeletal muscle. Most IMH are located in the lower extremity, particularly in the muscles of the thigh and rarely in head and neck region. 35 years old male reported with a swelling in the left cheek region since 3 years. Clinical and radiological evaluation leads to the diagnosis of Intramuscular hemangioma. Surgical excision was performed and histopathology confirmed the diagnosis. Hemangiomas of skeletal muscle represent 0.8% of all benign vascular neoplasm Welsch and Hengerer, 1980 [4]. Of these 13.8% occur in the head and neck region, with the masseter muscle being the most common site, followed by the trapezius and sternocleidomastoid muscles respectively. The lesions previously described as deep infiltrating angiolipomas have now been recognized by the WHO as intramuscular hemangiomas. numerous theories proposed for ethiopathogenisis of vascular lesions have been discussed. In conclusion, angiolipomas are rare in the head and neck region, and it should be considered in the differential diagnosis of masses in these regions. Proper radiological and clinical examination will reveal the type of vascular lesion. Excellent results can be obtained with timely management and good surgical skills.

Muscle spindles in the jaw-closing muscles, which are innervated by trigeminal mesencephalic neurons (MesV neurons), control the strength of occlusion and the position of the mandible. The mechanisms underlying cortical processing of proprioceptive information are critical to understanding how sensory information from the masticatory muscles regulates orofacial motor function. However, these mechanisms are mostly unknown. The present study aimed to identify the regions that process proprioception of the jaw-closing muscles using <i>in vivo</i> optical imaging with a voltage-sensitive dye in rats under urethane anesthesia. First, jaw opening that was produced by mechanically pulling down the mandible evoked an optical response, which reflects neural excitation, in two cortical regions: the most rostroventral part of the primary somatosensory cortex (S1) and the border between the ventral part of the secondary somatosensory cortex (S2) and the insular oral region (IOR). The kinetics of the optical signal, including the latency, amplitude, rise time, decay time and half duration, in the S1 region for the response with the largest amplitude were comparable to those in the region with the largest response in S2/IOR. Second, we visualized the regions responding to electrical stimulation of the masseter nerve, which activates both motor efferent fibers and somatosensory afferent fibers, including those that transmit nociceptive and proprioceptive information. Masseter nerve stimulation initially excited the rostral part of the S2/IOR region, and an adjacent region responded to jaw opening. The caudal part of the region showing the maximum response overlapped with the region responding to jaw opening, whereas the rostral part overlapped with the region responding to electrical stimulation of the maxillary and mandibular molar pulps. These findings suggest that proprioception of the masseter is processed in S1 and S2/IOR. Other sensory information, such as nociception, is processed in a region that is adjacent to these pulpal regions and is located in the rostral part of S2/IOR, which receives nociceptive inputs from the molar pulps. The spatial proximity of these regions may be associated with the mechanisms by which masseter muscle pain is incorrectly perceived as dental pain.

Masticatory myofascial trigger points (TrP) are one of the major causes of nondental pain in the orofacial region. Intramuscular injections are considered the first-line treatment for myofascial TrPs. The objectives of this study were to evaluate and compare the effectiveness of local anesthesia (LA), botulinum toxin (BTX), and platelet-rich plasma (PRP) injections for the treatment of myofascial TrPs in the masseter muscle. In this retrospective study, the sample was composed of patients with myofascial TrPs in masseter muscle who were treated between 2016 and 2019. Patients were divided into 3 groups according to treatment methods: group I (LA injection), group II (BTX injection), and group III (PRP injection). Primary outcome variable was the average pain level at rest and while chewing, and pressure pain intensity (PPI), Jaw Functional Limitation Scale (JFLS) value, and quality-of-life (measured using Oral Health Impact Profile-14 (OHIP-14)) were secondary outcomes. The outcome variables were assessed at diagnosis, and 1, 3, and 6 months post-treatment. The study consisted of 82 patients (group I, 27; group II, 26; group III, 29). At 1 and 3 months, improvement in all parameters was recorded in all groups. Groups I and II showed superior improvement in all parameters compared with group III at 3 months. Improvements in VAS pain, JFLS, and OHIP-14 values were significantly better in group II than group I at 3 months (P = .009; P = .004; P = .002). At 6 months, significant improvement in VAS pain, JFLS, and OHIP-14 (P = .008; P < .001; P < .01) values was recorded only in group II. All procedures successfully improved the symptoms of TrPs in the masseter muscle at 1 and 3 months. However, BTX injection seemed superior at the 3-month follow-up and remained effective up to 6 months.

Intramuscular hemangiomas of the masseter muscle are uncommon tumors and therefore can be difficult to accurately diagnose preoperatively, due to the unfamiliar presentation and deep location in the lateral face. A case of intramuscular hemangioma of the masseter muscle in a 66-yearold woman is presented. Doppler ultrasonography showed a 34× 15 mm hypoechoic and hypervascular soft tissue mass in the left masseter muscle, suggesting hemangioma. The mass was excised via a lateral cervical incision near the posterior border of the mandibular ramus. The surgical wound healed well without complications.

A macroscopic and microscopic study of the mandibular organ of the silky anteater (Cyclopes didactylus) was carried out. The organ extends from below the zygomatic bone line to the middle of the mandible body, between the skin and the masseter muscle, on both sides of the animal. It has an average length of 11.7 mm and a width of 6.3 mm. In the mesoscopic analysis, it was observed that the organ presents in yellowish color due to the high amount of sebaceous content. In the histological analysis, the mandibular organ was observed to be composed of innumerable alveoli of the specialized sebaceous gland, surrounded by a layer of adventitia tunica. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM), revealed an apparent alveolar division with what appeared to be a sulcus at its center. The information here presented regarding the constitution and location of this structure has not been previously explored for other species and differs with respect to other descriptions for anteaters. Based on the present study, it is suggested that the mandibular organ is involved in social interaction in this species.

Arteriovenous malformation is a tumor characterized by direct connection between an artery and vein without capillaries in-between, and it is commonly located intracranially. Intramuscular arteriovenous malformations are rare in the head and neck region. Less than 1% of the vascular tumors are localized in a muscle, 15% of them are in the head and neck muscles. Among the head and neck muscles, masseter muscle is the most common location, with the rate of 4.9%. The condition of a 36-year-old patient who applied to our clinic with the complaints of progressively increasing pain and progressively growing mass in the right cheek that appeared 1.5 years ago was diagnosed as arteriovenous malformation located in the masseter muscle. After preoperative embolization, the mass was successfully treated with total excision. In this case report, diagnostic and therapeutic tools addressing arteriovenous malformation located in the masseter muscle are discussed in the light of current literature.

The growth of the masseter muscle in eight infant, juvenile, and adolescent female rhesus monkeys (M. mulatta) was examined over a 2.5 year period using serial radiographic cephalometric techniques with the aid of radiopaque muscle markers. The radiopaque markers, which are composed of small pieces of root canal broach inserted into the muscle belly, make it possible to determine longitudinal masseter muscle growth as well as migration of the masseter muscle relative to the mandible. It was found that the masseter muscle increased in length by 64% during the total growth period, most of which occurred between 6 and 18 months of age. Relative to the cranium, the masseter muscle grew markedly inferiorly and only slightly posteriorly. Relative to the mandible, the masseter migrated in a posterior and slightly superior direction, keeping pace with the ramus and condyle as they grew posteriorly and posterosuperiorly throughout the study period. It was concluded that: 1) radiopaque muscle markers are a valuable tool for analysis of muscle growth and alteration of muscle location; 2) the masseter muscle in the rhesus monkey undergoes elongation, probably due to addition of sarcomeres at the fiber-tendon junctions; and 3) posterior migration of the masseter muscle relative to the corpus of the mandible, probably due to the nature of its periosteal attachment, results in a stability of the anteroposterior position of the masseter muscle despite the anterior displacement of the mandible.

In the giraffe (Giraffa camelopardalis), the masseter muscle was divided into several layers. The superficial and more medial (second) tendinous sheets of the masseter muscle fused with each other at the dorso-caudal part and a fleshy portion was located between these tendinous sheets. In the rostral part, the most superficial tendinous sheet turned around as a compact tendon and attached to the facial crest (Crista facialis). The turned tendinous sheet, however, never fused with the second tendinous sheet and this layer of the masseter muscle, that originated from the facial crest with the turned sheet, was inserted into the mandible with its fleshy portion. In the cattle, goat, sheep and Sika deer, the rostral layer of the masseter muscle arises from the facial crest with its fleshy portion and is inserted into the tubercle on the mandible through the strong tendinous sheet. In this study, the takin also showed the same structure of the masseter muscle. In the giraffe, however, the rostral layer inserted into the mandible through the strong tendinous sheet could not be distinguished, thus, there was no conspicuous tubercle on the mandible. Moreover in the masseteric region of the skull.,the giraffe was similar to the Sika deer in several ways. However, it is suggested that the giraffe exerts smaller forces on the cheek teeth than does the Sika deer because of its longer Margo interalveolaris.

As part of this study, a comparative analysis of the temporal and masseter muscle electrical activity at rest and during mandible excursion positions (protrusion, laterotrusion and maximal occlusion) was performed among patients aged 21 to 68 years. Each of three groups: opioid addicts, alcohol addicts and the control group - consisted of 30 individuals (90 individuals in total, including 37 females and 53 males). Electrodes were placed on the masseter venters and mandibular movements were executed: right/left lateral, protrusion, intercuspation, rest and MVC. Then the same routine was applied to the anterior parts of temporal muscles. Based on EMG data in alcohol addicts, higher electrical activity of masseters and temporal muscles was observed during the mandible excursions, compared to the control group. In comparison of opiate addicts to healthy controls, no statistical significance was observed in electrical activity of masseter and temporal muscles. On the basis of the conducted research, a conclusion can be drawn that alcohol addiction significantly affects the function of the largest muscles of the stomatognathic system.

Less than 1% of vasoformative tumours throughout the body occur in skeletal muscle and 15% of them arise in head and neck musculature. The masseter muscle is the most frequent site and accounts for approximately 5% of all intramuscular vascular malformations in the head and neck region. Masseteric venous malformations have a typical clinical presentation and imaging characteristics that should allow clinicians to distinguish them from other abnormalities presenting in this area. We present seven cases of these unusual intramasseteric venous malformations and the diagnosis and management of these lesions is discussed. The diagnosis was made on clinical grounds and was confirmed on MRI. All underwent surgical excision through a facelift approach and were successfully removed from within the substance of the masseter muscle with preservation of the facial nerve. Venous malformations within the masseter are rare but are easy to diagnose and can be reliably surgically excised without complications.

The masseter muscle is often exploited by craniofacial surgeons in transposition operations to correct facial palsy, benign masseteric hypertrophy; or neurectomy-induced atrophy of the muscle. A clear understanding of the course of the premasseteric branch of the facial artery and its relations with adjacent structures is essential in maneuvering the masseter muscle safely. In the present study the premasseteric branch was analyzed in details. Neurovascular and anatomical features and relations of the premasseteric branch and its branches were evaluated according to location, origin, diameter, length and course by bilateral meticulous anatomic micro dissection under 4x loop magnification in formalin fixed 14 adult preserved cadavers. The premasseteric branch originated separately from the facial artery in all cases. The course of the branch was observed to the upper anterior border of the masseter muscle. The diameter of the premasseteric branch was 1.12 mm (mean) at the level of origin. The diameter of the premasseteric branch was larger than the facial artery in 3% of cases. The location of the branch was defined according to body of the mandible. Branches and anastomoses of the premasseteric branch were also represented. Anatomical data of the premasseteric branch will help craniofacial surgeons elevate flaps safely.

Nodular fasciitis (NF) is a benign, reactive proliferation of fibroblasts in subcutaneous tissues which commonly occurs in the deep fascia. It can only be diagnosed by histopathological examination of a biopsy. A total of 23 orofacial NF patients was analysed, including those reported in the English language literature and six new patients from the files of this hospital. All patients were treated between 1994 and 2005. The reported lesions were located in cheek masseter muscle, parotid gland, upper neck, upper gingiva and body of mandibular. The clinical and histological features and differential diagnoses are discussed. All lesions were removed under general or local anaesthesia and no recurrence of the lesions was found.
