What is Dravet syndrome?

[PMID: 24155976]
Dravet syndrome is a severe form of intractable pediatric epilepsy with a high incidence of SUDEP: Sudden Unexpected Death in epilepsy. Cardiac arrhythmias are a proposed cause for some cases of SUDEP, yet the susceptibility and potential mechanism of arrhythmogenesis in Dravet syndrome remain unknown. The majority of Dravet syndrome patients have de novo mutations in SCN1A, resulting in haploinsufficiency. We propose that, in addition to neuronal hyperexcitability, SCN1A haploinsufficiency alters cardiac electrical function and produces arrhythmias, providing a potential mechanism for SUDEP. Postnatal day 15-21 heterozygous SCN1A-R1407X knock-in mice, expressing a human Dravet syndrome mutation, were used to investigate a possible cardiac phenotype. A combination of single cell electrophysiology and in vivo electrocardiogram (ECG) recordings were performed. We observed a 2-fold increase in both transient and persistent Na(+) current density in isolated Dravet syndrome ventricular myocytes that resulted from increased activity of a tetrodotoxin-resistant Na(+) current, likely Nav1.5. Dravet syndrome myocytes exhibited increased excitability, action potential duration prolongation, and triggered activity. Continuous radiotelemetric ECG recordings showed QT prolongation, ventricular ectopic foci, idioventricular rhythms, beat-to-beat variability, ventricular fibrillation, and focal bradycardia. Spontaneous deaths were recorded in 2 DS mice, and a third became moribund and required euthanasia. These data from single cell and whole animal experiments suggest that altered cardiac electrical function in Dravet syndrome may contribute to the susceptibility for arrhythmogenesis and SUDEP. These mechanistic insights may lead to critical risk assessment and intervention in human patients.

Dravet syndrome, or as it was called in the past 'severe myoclonic epilepsy in infancy', is a drug-resistant epilepsy first described by Charlotte Dravet in 1978. Besides the well-known and well-described therapy resistance, Dravet syndrome dramatically impacts the development and behaviour of the affected children. As it is still not a curable disease, families need to be taught how to cope with the disorder and will require assistance from both clinical and non-clinical structures. At the onset of the disease, many questions arise regarding the diagnosis of Dravet syndrome, the severity of the illness and its deleterious effects, and the management of seizures, especially the long-lasting status epilepticus. Once the diagnosis has been established, severe convulsions, often unpredictable and long-lasting, are still a major worry, but developmental and behavioural problems also rapidly become a serious concern. Later on, nearly all parents will have a child who becomes an adult with special needs, requiring specialised attention from professionals.

Dravet syndrome is an epileptic encephalopathy characterized by multiple types of seizures. We report the first case of musicogenic reflex seizures in a 7-year-old male with a mutation in the SCN1A gene causing Dravet syndrome. Reflex seizures have been reported in patients with Dravet syndrome provoked by body temperature elevation, looking at visual patterns, or under intermittent photic stimulation. The case we report widens the spectrum of reflex seizures recorded in patients with Dravet syndrome. Cortical hyperexcitability of genetic origin could explain the tendency of these patients to experience reflex seizures.

Dravet syndrome is a rare form of epilepsy largely refractory to current antiepileptic medications. The only precedents of randomized placebo-controlled trials in Dravet syndrome are the two small trials that led to the approval of stiripentol. With the arrival of new clinical trials for Dravet syndrome, we sought to determine the characteristics of the patient population with Dravet syndrome in Europe today, which has possibly evolved subsequent to the approval of stiripentol and the ability to diagnose milder clinical cases via genetic testing. From May to June 2014, we conducted an online parent-reported survey to collect information about the demographics, disease-specific clinical characteristics, as well as current and past use of antiepileptic medications by European patients with Dravet syndrome. We present data from 274 patients with Dravet syndrome from 15 European countries. Most patients were between 4 and 8years of age, and 90% had known mutations in SCN1A. Their epilepsy was characterized by multiple seizure types, although only 45% had more than 4 tonic-clonic seizures per month on average. The most common drug combination was valproate, clobazam, and stiripentol, with 42% of the total population currently taking stiripentol. Over a third of patients with Dravet syndrome had taken sodium channel blockers in the past, and most had motor and behavioral comorbidities. Our study helps define the current typical European patient with Dravet syndrome. The results from this survey may have important implications for the design of future clinical trials that investigate new treatments for Dravet syndrome.

Dravet syndrome, a severe infantile epilepsy syndrome, is typically resistant to anti-epileptic drugs (AED). Lamotrigine (LTG), an AED that is effective for both focal and generalized seizures, has been reported to aggravate seizures in Dravet syndrome. Therefore, LTG is usually avoided in Dravet syndrome. We describe two adults and a child with Dravet syndrome in whom LTG resulted in decreased seizure duration and frequency. This benefit was highlighted in each patient when LTG was withdrawn after 6 to 15 years, and resulted in an increased frequency of convulsive seizures together with longer seizure duration. A 25-year-old male required hospital admission for frequent seizures for the first time in 7 years, 6 weeks after ceasing LTG. Reintroduction of LTG improved seizure control, suggesting that in some patients with Dravet syndrome, LTG may be beneficial.

Dravet syndrome is an intractable epileptic syndrome beginning in the first year of life. De novo mutations of SCN1A, which encode the Na(v)1.1 neuronal voltage-gated sodium channel, are considered the major cause of Dravet syndrome. In this study, we investigated genetic modifiers of this syndrome. We performed a mutational analysis of all coding exons of CACNA1A in 48 subjects with Dravet syndrome. To assess the effects of CACNA1A variants on the epileptic phenotypes of Dravet syndrome, we compared clinical features in two genotype groups: 1) subjects harboring SCN1A mutations but no CACNA1A variants (n=20) and 2) subjects with SCN1A mutations plus CACNA1A variants (n=20). CACNA1A variants detected in patients were studied using heterologous expression of recombinant human Ca(v)2.1 in HEK 293 cells and whole-cell patch-clamp recording. Nine CACNA1A variants, including six novel ones, were detected in 21 of the 48 subjects (43.8%). Based on the incidence of variants in healthy controls, most of the variants seemed to be common polymorphisms. However, the subjects harboring SCN1A mutations and CACNA1A variants had absence seizures more frequently than the patients with only SCN1A mutations (8/20 vs. 0/20, p=0.002). Moreover, the former group of subjects exhibited earlier onset of seizures and more frequent prolonged seizures before one year of age, compared to the latter group of subjects. The electrophysiological properties of four of the five novel Ca(v)2.1 variants exhibited biophysical changes consistent with gain-of-function. We conclude that CACNA1A variants in some persons with Dravet syndrome may modify the epileptic phenotypes.

Dravet syndrome is an epileptic syndrome of infancy. We describe the features of two cases with genetically verified SCNA1 mutations. The diagnosis was established rather late in one case. The epilepsies were medically intractable and the symptoms characteristic of Dravet syndrome. The children received inappropriate medication. Early diagnosis including genetic testing could possibly make the outcome more favourable and reduce the need for other specialized aetiologic investigations.

Dravet syndrome is one of the most severe epilepsy syndromes of early childhood, and it comes with very high morbidity and mortality. The typical presentation is characterized by hemiclonic or generalized clonic seizures triggered by fever during the first year of life, followed by myoclonic, absence, focal and generalized tonic-clonic seizures. Non-convulsive status epilepticus and epileptic encephalopathy are common. Development is normal in the first year of life, but most individuals eventually suffer from intellectual impairment. Dravet syndrome is associated with mutations in the sodium channel alpha1 subunit gene (SCN1A) in 70-80% of individuals. SCN1A mutation results in inhibition of the GABAergic inhibitory interneurons, leading to excessive neuronal excitation. The "interneuron hypothesis" is the current most accepted pathophysiological mechanism of Dravet syndrome. The mortality rate is increased significantly in Dravet syndrome. Ataxia, a characteristic crouched gait and Parkinson's symptoms may develop in some individuals. It is likely that Dravet syndrome is underdiagnosed in adults with treatment-resistant epilepsy. Early diagnosis is important to avoid anti-seizure medications that exacerbate seizures.

Dravet syndrome is a rare epileptic encephalopathy characterized by treatment-resistant polymorphic seizures. Seizure onset usually occurs during the first year of life, and seizures are often associated with heat-related triggering factors (e.g., fever, photosensitivity, or hot bath). It has been reported that children with Dravet syndrome often present with recurrent febrile seizures and vaccination-related seizures. We analyzed the occurrence of vaccination-related seizures (defined as the development of a seizure within 48 hours post vaccination) in 54 patients with Dravet syndrome. Patients were divided into two groups according to whether seizures occurred within 48 hours of vaccination (i.e., vaccination-proximate group) or not (vaccination-distant group). There was no significant difference in the vaccination-proximate group and vaccination-distant group for the presence of SCN1A mutation. In our Dravet syndrome cohort, the vaccination-proximate group consisted of 17 (31.5%) patients with Dravet syndrome. Thus vaccination-related seizures are a common triggering factor in Dravet syndrome, reported in up to one third of our patients. Vaccination-related seizures may act as the triggering factor for the onset of seizures in children with Dravet syndrome, especially before the definitive diagnosis of Dravet syndrome can be made within the first year of life. We suggest further study of guidelines and protocols for the prevention and management of vaccination-related seizures in children with recurrent febrile seizures pending a definitive diagnosis of Dravet syndrome in the first 12 months of life.

Dravet syndrome is a severe infantile epileptic encephalopathy caused in approximately 80% of cases by mutations in the voltage gated sodium channel subunit gene SCN1A. The majority of these mutations are de novo. The parental origin of de novo mutations varies widely among genetic disorders and the aim of this study was to determine this for Dravet syndrome. 91 patients with de novo SCN1A mutations and their parents were genotyped for single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in the region surrounding their mutation. Allele specific polymerase chain reaction (PCR) based on informative SNPs was used to separately amplify and sequence the paternal and maternal alleles to determine in which parental chromosome the mutation arose. The parental origin of SCN1A mutations was established in 44 patients for whom both parents were available and SNPs were informative. The mutations were of paternal origin in 33 cases and of maternal origin in the remaining 11 cases. De novo mutation of SCN1A most commonly, but not exclusively, originates from the paternal chromosome. The average age of parents originating mutations did not differ from that of the general population. The greater frequency of paternally derived mutations in SCN1A is likely to be due to the greater chance of mutational events during the increased number of mitoses which occur during spermatogenesis compared to oogenesis, and the greater susceptibility to mutagenesis of the methylated DNA characteristic of sperm cells.

Dravet syndrome is an epileptic syndrome of infancy and early childhood. Most cases of Dravet syndrome seem to be due to a genetic defect causing the sodium channel to malfunction. We describe the main features of the syndrome. This epilepsy is medically intractable, but we call attention to the fact that some medications are of benefit and some could exacerbate the condition. Early recognition of the syndrome including by genetic testing could possibly improve outcome and reduce the need for other specialized investigations.

Dravet syndrome is an epilepsy syndrome of infantile onset, frequently caused by SCN1A mutations or deletions. Its prevalence, long-term evolution in adults and neuropathology are not well known. We identified a series of 22 adult patients, including three adult post-mortem cases with Dravet syndrome. For all patients, we reviewed the clinical history, seizure types and frequency, antiepileptic drugs, cognitive, social and functional outcome and results of investigations. A systematic neuropathology study was performed, with post-mortem material from three adult cases with Dravet syndrome, in comparison with controls and a range of relevant paediatric tissue. Twenty-two adults with Dravet syndrome, 10 female, were included, median age 39 years (range 20-66). SCN1A structural variation was found in 60% of the adult Dravet patients tested, including one post-mortem case with DNA extracted from brain tissue. Novel mutations were described for 11 adult patients; one patient had three SCN1A mutations. Features of Dravet syndrome in adulthood include multiple seizure types despite polytherapy, and age-dependent evolution in seizure semiology and electroencephalographic pattern. Fever sensitivity persisted through adulthood in 11 cases. Neurological decline occurred in adulthood with cognitive and motor deterioration. Dysphagia may develop in or after the fourth decade of life, leading to significant morbidity, or death. The correct diagnosis at an older age made an impact at several levels. Treatment changes improved seizure control even after years of drug resistance in all three cases with sufficient follow-up after drug changes were instituted; better control led to significant improvement in cognitive performance and quality of life in adulthood in two cases. There was no histopathological hallmark feature of Dravet syndrome in this series. Strikingly, there was remarkable preservation of neurons and interneurons in the neocortex and hippocampi of Dravet adult post-mortem cases. Our study provides evidence that Dravet syndrome is at least in part an epileptic encephalopathy.

Dravet syndrome and genetic epilepsy with febrile seizures plus (GEFS+) can both arise due to mutations of SCN1A, the gene encoding the alpha 1 pore-forming subunit of the sodium channel. GEFS+ refers to a familial epilepsy syndrome where at least two family members have phenotypes that fit within the GEFS+ spectrum. The GEFS+ spectrum comprises a range of mild to severe phenotypes varying from classical febrile seizures to Dravet syndrome. Dravet syndrome is a severe infantile onset epilepsy syndrome with multiple seizure types, developmental slowing and poor outcome. More than 70% of patients with Dravet syndrome have mutations of SCN1A; these include both truncation and missense mutations. In contrast, only 10% of GEFS+ families have SCN1A mutations and these comprise missense mutations. GEFS+ has also been associated with mutations of genes encoding the sodium channel beta 1 subunit, SCN1B, and the GABA(A) receptor gamma 2 subunit, GABRG2. The phenotypic heterogeneity that is characteristic of GEFS+ families is likely to be due to modifier genes. Interpretation of the significance of a SCN1A missense mutation requires a thorough understanding of the phenotypes in the GEFS+ spectrum whereas a de novo truncation mutation is likely to be associated with a severe phenotype. Early recognition of Dravet syndrome is important as aggressive control of seizures may improve developmental outcome.

Dravet syndrome is a severe form of epileptic encephalopathy characterized by early onset epileptic seizures followed by ataxia and cognitive decline. Approximately 80% of patients with Dravet syndrome have been associated with heterozygous mutations in SCN1A gene encoding voltage-gated sodium channel (VGSC) α(I) subunit, whereas a homozygous mutation (p.Arg125Cys) of SCN1B gene encoding VGSC β(I) subunit was recently described in a patient with Dravet syndrome. To further examine the involvement of homozygous SCN1B mutations in the etiology of Dravet syndrome, we performed mutational analyses on SCN1B in 286 patients with epileptic disorders, including 67 patients with Dravet syndrome who have been negative for SCN1A and SCN2A mutations. In the cohort, we found one additional homozygous mutation (p.Ile106Phe) in a patient with Dravet syndrome. The identified homozygous SCN1B mutations indicate that SCN1B is an etiologic candidate underlying Dravet syndrome.

To describe the long term efficacy and tolerance of stiripentol associated with valproate and clobazam in an exhaustive cohort of patients with severe myoclonic epilepsy of infancy (Dravet's syndrome), in which short term efficacy of such a treatment has recently been demonstrated in a placebo-controlled trial. In 46 patients the frequency and the duration of seizures was significantly reduced (p < 0.001) as well as the number of convulsive status at a median of three-year follow-up. Ten patients were dramatically improved (seizures significantly decreased in number [p = 0.002] and duration [p = 0.002] and status epilepticus disappeared), 20 were moderately improved (seizures significantly decreased in duration [p = 0.001] and status were less numerous), four had no response and efficacy was non evaluable in 12 mainly because of adverse events. Efficacy was better in the youngest patients. The most frequent adverse events were loss of appetite and loss of weight. They could be so severe in patients over 12 years of age that the stiripentol dosage could not be increased to 50 mg kg-1 j-1. This follow-up study shows that stiripentol added to valproate and clobazam maintains its efficacy at long term in children with severe myoclonic epilepsy of infancy and suggests that the tritherapy should be introduced as early as possible in these patients in order to suppress the convulsive status epilepticus.

Dravet syndrome is a drug resistant epilepsy which starts in the first year of life with febrile seizures, followed by cognitive impairment and epilepsy with multiple seizure types. Diagnosis has been typically made at the age of three to four years, but earlier diagnosis is now possible as clinical features are better recognised and molecular diagnosis is available. We studied a series of 14 children with Dravet syndrome or Dravet spectrum epilepsy. A screening test, developed by other authors to distinguish the febrile seizures in Dravet syndrome from febrile seizures from other origin, was applied to the clinical features of the seizures occurring during the first year of life in our patients. Clinical suspicion of Dravet spectrum epilepsy was possible in 100% of children in our series. Moreover, taking into consideration only the first seizure, 79% of patients scored sufficiently to detect Dravet syndrome. Dravet syndrome can be recognised during the first year of life. It is important that physicians are made aware of these clinical criteria capable to distinguish febrile seizures in Dravet syndrome from febrile seizures of other origin, and set up a protocol to collect appropriate data regarding febrile seizures occurring in the first year of life.

Dravet syndrome or severe myoclonic epilepsy of infancy (SMEI) is a baleful epileptic encephalopathy that begins in the first year of life. This syndrome specified by febrile seizures followed by intractable epilepsy, disturbed psychomotor development, and ataxia. Clinical similarities between Dravet syndrome and generalized epilepsy with febrile seizure plus (GEFS+) includes occurrence of febrile seizures and joint molecular genetic etiology. Shared features of these two diseases support the idea that these two disorders represent a severity spectrum of the same illness. Nowadays, more than 60 heterozygous pattern SCN1A mutations, which many are de novo mutations, have been detected in Dravet syndrome. From May 2008 to August 2012, 35 patients who referred to Pediatric Neurology Clinic of Mofid Children Hospital in Tehran were enrolled in this study. Entrance criterion of this study was having equal or more than four criteria for Dravet syndrome. We compared clinical features and genetic findings of the patients diagnosed as Dravet syndrome or GEFS+. 35 patients (15 girls and 20 boys) underwent genetic testing. Mean age of them was 7.7 years (a range of 13 months to 15 years). Three criteria that were best evident in SCN1A mutation positive patients are as follows: "Normal development before the onset of seizures, onset of seizure before age of one year, and psychomotor retardation after onset of seizures. Our genetic testing showed that 1 of 3 (33.3%) patients with clinical Dravet syndrome and 3 of 20 (15%) patients that diagnosed as GEFS+, had SCN1A mutation. In this study, normal development before seizure onset, seizures beginning before age of one year and psychomotor retardation after age of two years are the most significant criteria in SCN1A mutation positive patients.

Dravet syndrome is a severe form of epilepsy. Majority of patients have a mutation in SCN1A gene, which encodes a voltage-gated sodium channel. A recent study has demonstrated that 16% of SCN1A-negative patients have a mutation in PCDH19, the gene encoding protocadherin-19. Mutations in other genes account for only a very small proportion of families. TSPYL4 is a novel candidate gene within the locus 6q16.3-q22.31 identified by linkage study. The present study examined the mutations in epileptic Chinese children with emphasis on Dravet syndrome. A hundred children with severe epilepsy were divided into Dravet syndrome and non-Dravet syndrome groups and screened for SCN1A mutations by direct sequencing. SCN1A-negative Dravet syndrome patients and patients with phenotypes resembling Dravet syndrome were checked for PCDH19 and TSPYL4 mutations. Eighteen patients (9 males, 9 females) were diagnosed to have Dravet syndrome. Among them, 83% (15/18) had SCN1A mutations including truncating (7), splice site (2) and missense mutations (6). The truncating/splice site mutations were associated with moderate to severe degree of intellectual disability (p<0.05). During the progression of disease, 73% (11/15) had features fitting into the diagnostic criteria of autism spectrum disorder and 53% (8/15) had history of vaccination-induced seizures. A novel PCDH19 p.D377N mutation was identified in one SCN1A-negative female patient with Dravet syndrome and a known PCDH19 p.N340S mutation in a female non-Dravet syndrome patient. The former also inherited a TSPYL4 p.G60R variant. A high percentage of SCN1A mutations was identified in our Chinese cohort of Dravet syndrome patients but none in the rest of patients. We demonstrated that truncating/splice site mutations were linked to moderate to severe intellectual disability in these patients. A de novo PCDH19 missense mutation together with an inherited TSPYL4 missense variant were identified in a patient with Dravet syndrome.

Severe myoclonic epilepsy in infants (SMEI), also known as Dravet syndrome, is a rare, refractory form of epilepsy, for whose treatment stiripentol (STP) has been recently licensed for add-on use. To evaluate the efficacy and tolerability of STP and other antiepileptic drug treatments (including ketogenic diet) as therapy for patients with SMEI. We searched the Cochrane Epilepsy Group Specialised Register (15 May 2013), the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL, Issue 4 of 12, The Cochrane Library, April 2013), MEDLINE (1946 to May 2013) and SCOPUS (1823 to May 2013). The online trials registries ClinicalTrials.gov and the WHO International Clinical Trials Registry Platform were systematically searched. The bibliographies of any identified study were searched for further references. We handsearched selected journals and conference proceedings. No language restrictions were imposed. Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) or quasi-randomised controlled trials; double- or single-blinded or unblinded trials; and parallel-group studies. Administration of at least one antiepileptic drug therapy given singly (monotherapy) or in combination (add-on therapy) compared with add-on placebo or no add-on treatment. Review authors independently selected trials for inclusion according to predefined criteria, extracted relevant data and evaluated the methodological quality of trials. The following outcomes were assessed: at least 50% seizure reduction, seizure freedom, adverse effects, proportion of dropouts and quality of life. Outcomes were assessed using a Mantel-Haenszel meta-analysis to calculate risk ratio (RR) with 95% confidence intervals (95% CIs). No RCTs assessing drugs other than STP were found. Two RCTs evaluating the use of STP (total of 64 children) were included. Both studies were generally at unclear risk of bias. A significantly higher proportion of participants had 50% or greater reduction in seizure frequency in the STP group compared with the placebo group (22/33 vs 2/31; RR 10.40, 95% CI 2.64 to 40.87). A significantly higher proportion of participants achieved seizure freedom in the STP group compared with the placebo group (12/33 vs 1/31; RR 7.93, 95% CI 1.52 to 41.21). No significant difference in the proportion of dropouts was found in the STP group compared with the placebo group (2/33 vs 8/31; RR 0.24, 95% CI 0.06 to 1.03). Only one study explicitly reported the occurrence of side effects; higher proportions of participants were reported to experience side effects in the STP group compared with the placebo group (100% vs 25%; RR 3.73, 95% CI 1.81 to 7.67). Data derived from two small RCTs indicate that STP is significantly better than placebo with regards to 50% or greater reduction in seizure frequency and seizure freedom. Adverse effects occurred more frequently with STP. Further adequately powered studies with long-term follow-up should be conducted to unequivocally establish the long-term efficacy and tolerability of STP in the treatment of SMEI.

Neurological and psychiatric syndromes often have multiple disease traits, yet it is unknown how such multi-faceted deficits arise from single mutations. Haploinsufficiency of the voltage-gated sodium channel Nav1.1 causes Dravet syndrome, an intractable childhood-onset epilepsy with hyperactivity, cognitive deficit, autistic-like behaviours, and premature death. Deletion of Nav1.1 channels selectively impairs excitability of GABAergic interneurons. We studied mice having selective deletion of Nav1.1 in parvalbumin- or somatostatin-expressing interneurons. In brain slices, these deletions cause increased threshold for action potential generation, impaired action potential firing in trains, and reduced amplification of postsynaptic potentials in those interneurons. Selective deletion of Nav1.1 in parvalbumin- or somatostatin-expressing interneurons increases susceptibility to thermally-induced seizures, which are strikingly prolonged when Nav1.1 is deleted in both interneuron types. Mice with global haploinsufficiency of Nav1.1 display autistic-like behaviours, hyperactivity and cognitive impairment. Haploinsufficiency of Nav1.1 in parvalbumin-expressing interneurons causes autistic-like behaviours, but not hyperactivity, whereas haploinsufficiency in somatostatin-expressing interneurons causes hyperactivity without autistic-like behaviours. Heterozygous deletion in both interneuron types is required to impair long-term spatial memory in context-dependent fear conditioning, without affecting short-term spatial learning or memory. Thus, the multi-faceted phenotypes of Dravet syndrome can be genetically dissected, revealing synergy in causing epilepsy, premature death and deficits in long-term spatial memory, but interneuron-specific effects on hyperactivity and autistic-like behaviours. These results show that multiple disease traits can arise from similar functional deficits in specific interneuron types.

To determine the prevalence of Dravet syndrome, an epileptic encephalopathy caused by SCN1A-mutations, often with seizure onset after vaccination, among infants reported with seizures following vaccination. To determine differences in characteristics of reported seizures after vaccination in children with and without SCN1A-related Dravet syndrome. Data were reviewed of 1,269 children with seizures following immunization in the first two years of life, reported to the safety surveillance system of the Dutch national immunization program between 1 January 1997 and 31 December 2006. Selective, prospective follow-up was performed of children with clinical characteristics compatible with a diagnosis of Dravet syndrome. In 21.9% (n = 279) of children, a diagnosis of Dravet syndrome could not be excluded based on available clinical data (median age at follow-up 16 months). Additional follow-up data were obtained in 83.9% (n = 234) of these children (median age 8.5 years). 15 (1.2% of 1,269; 95%CI:0.6 to 1.8%) children were diagnosed with SCN1A-related Dravet syndrome. Of all reported seizures following vaccinations in the first year of life, 2.5% (95%CI:1.3 to 3.6%) were due to SCN1A-related Dravet syndrome, as were 5.9% of reported seizures (95%CI:3.1 to 8.7%) after 2(nd) or 3(rd) DTP-IPV-Hib vaccination. Seizures in children with SCN1A-related Dravet syndrome occurred more often with a body temperature below 38.5°C (57.9% vs. 32.6%, p = 0.020) and reoccurred more often after following vaccinations (26.7% vs. 4.0%, p = 0.003), than in children without a diagnosis of SCN1A-related Dravet Syndrome. Although Dravet syndrome is a rare genetic epilepsy syndrome, 2.5% of reported seizures following vaccinations in the first year of life in our cohort occurred in children with this disorder. Knowledge on the specific characteristics of vaccination-related seizures in this syndrome might promote early diagnosis and indirectly, public faith in vaccination safety.

Dravet syndrome is a severe infantile-onset epileptic encephalopathy associated with mutations in the sodium channel alpha-1 subunit gene SCN1A. We aimed to describe the incidence of Dravet syndrome in the Danish population. Based on a 6-year birth cohort from 2004 to 2009, we propose an incidence of 1:22,000, which is higher than what has been established earlier. We identified 17 cases with SCN1A mutation-positive Dravet syndrome. Fifteen patients were found, by conventional Sanger sequencing. Two additional patients with clinical Dravet syndrome, but without a detectable SCN1A mutation by Sanger sequencing, were diagnosed with a SCN1A mutation after using a targeted next-generation sequencing gene panel.
