The immediate early 62 protein (IE62) of varicella-zoster virus (VZV), a major viral trans-activator, initiates the virus life cycle and is a key component of pathogenesis. The IE62 possesses several domains essential for trans-activation, including an acidic trans-activation domain (TAD), a serine-rich tract (SRT), and binding domains for USF, TFIIB, and TATA box binding protein (TBP). Transient-transfection assays showed that the VZV IE62 lacking the SRT trans-activated the early VZV ORF61 promoter at only 16% of the level of the full-length IE62. When the SRT of IE62 was replaced with the SRT of equine herpesvirus 1 (EHV-1) IEP, its trans-activation activity was completely restored. Herpes simplex virus 1 (HSV-1) ICP4 that lacks a TAD very weakly (1.5-fold) trans-activated the ORF61 promoter. An IE62 TAD-ICP4 chimeric protein exhibited trans-activation ability (10.2-fold), indicating that the IE62 TAD functions with the SRT of HSV-1 ICP4 to trans-activate viral promoters. When the serine and acidic residues of the SRT were replaced with Ala, Leu, and Gly, trans-activation activities of the modified IE62 proteins IE62-SRTΔSe and IE62-SRTΔAc were reduced to 46% and 29% of wild-type activity, respectively. Bimolecular complementation assays showed that the TAD of IE62, EHV-1 IEP, and HSV-1 VP16 interacted with Mediator 25 in human melanoma MeWo cells. The SRT of IE62 interacted with the nucleolar-ribosomal protein EAP, which resulted in the formation of globular structures within the nucleus. These results suggest that the SRT plays an important role in VZV viral gene expression and replication. The immediate early 62 protein (IE62) of varicella-zoster virus (VZV) is a major viral trans-activator and is essential for viral growth. Our data show that the serine-rich tract (SRT) of VZV IE62, which is well conserved within the alphaherpesviruses, is needed for trans-activation mediated by the acidic trans-activation domain (TAD). The TADs of IE62, EHV-1 IEP, and HSV-1 VP16 interacted with cellular Mediator 25 in bimolecular complementation assays. The interaction of the IE62 SRT with nucleolar-ribosomal protein EAP resulted in the formation of globular structures within the nucleus. Understanding the mechanisms by which the TAD and SRT of IE62 contribute to the function of this essential regulatory protein is important in understanding the gene program of this human pathogen.

ERK5, the last MAP kinase family member discovered, is activated by the upstream kinase MEK5 in response to growth factors and stress stimulation. MEK5-ERK5 pathway has been associated to different cellular processes, playing a crucial role in cell proliferation in normal and cancer cells by mechanisms that are both dependent and independent of its kinase activity. Thus, nuclear ERK5 activates transcription factors by either direct phosphorylation or acting as co-activator thanks to a unique transcriptional activation TAD domain located at its C-terminal tail. Consequently, ERK5 has been proposed as an interesting target to tackle different cancers, and either inhibitors of ERK5 activity or silencing the protein have shown antiproliferative activity in cancer cells and to block tumor growth in animal models. Here, we review the different mechanisms involved in ERK5 nuclear translocation and their consequences. Inactive ERK5 resides in the cytosol, forming a complex with Hsp90-Cdc37 superchaperone. In a canonical mechanism, MEK5-dependent activation results in ERK5 C-terminal autophosphorylation, Hsp90 dissociation, and nuclear translocation. This mechanism integrates signals such as growth factors and stresses that activate the MEK5-ERK5 pathway. Importantly, two other mechanisms, MEK5-independent, have been recently described. These mechanisms allow nuclear shuttling of kinase-inactive forms of ERK5. Although lacking kinase activity, these forms activate transcription by interacting with transcription factors through the TAD domain. Both mechanisms also require Hsp90 dissociation previous to nuclear translocation. One mechanism involves phosphorylation of the C-terminal tail of ERK5 by kinases that are activated during mitosis, such as Cyclin-dependent kinase-1. The second mechanism involves overexpression of chaperone Cdc37, an oncogene that is overexpressed in cancers such as prostate adenocarcinoma, where it collaborates with ERK5 to promote cell proliferation. Although some ERK5 kinase inhibitors have shown antiproliferative activity it is likely that those tumors expressing kinase-inactive nuclear ERK5 will not respond to these inhibitors.

p300/cyclic AMP-responsive element binding protein-binding protein (CBP) are general coactivators for multiple transcription factors involved in various cellular processes. Several highly conserved domains of p300/CBP serve as interacting sites for transcription factors and regulatory proteins. Particularly, the intrinsic histone acetyltransferase (HAT) activity and transactivation domains (TAD) play essential roles for their coactivating function. Autoacetylation of p300/CBP is commonly observed in cell-free HAT assays and has been implicated in the regulation of their HAT activity. Here, we show that six lysine-rich regions in several highly conserved functional domains of p300 are targeted by p300HAT for acetylation in cell-free systems. We show that p300 is susceptible to acetylation in cultured tumor cells and that its acetylation status is affected by histone deacetylase inhibitor trichostatin A. We further show that either treatment with deacetylase inhibitors or coexpression of Gal4-p300HAT, which alone has no transactivation activity, stimulates the activity of the COOH-terminal TAD of p300 (p300C-TAD). We have defined the minimal p300C-TAD and show that it is sufficient to respond to deacetylase inhibitors and is a substrate for p300HAT. Finally, we show that acetylated p300 possesses enhanced ability to interact with p53. Taken together, our data suggest that acetylation regulates p300C-TAD and that acetylation of p300/CBP may contribute to the dynamic regulation of their complex formation with various interacting partners.

Sox9 plays an important role in a large variety of developmental pathways in vertebrates. It is composed of three domains: high-mobility group box (HMG box), dimerization (DIM) and transactivation (TAD). One of the main processes for regulation and variability of the pathways involving Sox9 is the self-gene expression regulation of Sox9. However, the subsequent roles of the Sox9 domains can also generate regulatory modulations. Studies have shown that TADs can bind to different types of proteins and its function seems to be influenced by DIM. Therefore, we hypothesized that both domains are directly associated and can be responsible for the functional variability of Sox9. We applied a method based on a broad phylogenetic context, using sequences of the HMG box domain, to ensure the homology of all the Sox9 copies used herein. The data obtained included 4,921 sequences relative to 657 metazoan species. Based on coevolutionary and selective pressure analyses of the Sox9 sequences, we observed coevolutions involving DIM and TADs. These data, along with the experimental data from literature, indicate a functional relationship between these domains. Moreover, DIM and TADs may be responsible for the functional plasticity of Sox9 because they are more tolerant for molecular changes (higher Ka/Ks ratio than the HMG box domain). This tolerance could allow a differential regulation of target genes or promote novel targets during transcriptional activation. In conclusion, we suggest that DIM and TADs functional association may regulate differentially the target genes or even promote novel targets during transcription activation mediated by Sox9 paralogs, contributing to the subfunctionalization of Sox9a and Sox9b in teleosts.

The Notch intracellular region (RAMIC) interacts with a DNA binding protein RBP-J to activate transcription of genes that inhibit cell differentiation. The RAM domain and ankyrin (ANK) repeats of mouse Notch1 RAMIC were shown to be responsible for RBP-J binding and necessary for transactivation. The C-terminal portion of Notch1 RAMIC has also been suggested to be important for transactivation. Using GAL4 fusion constructs, we identified a novel transactivation domain (TAD) between the ANK repeats and the PEST sequence of mouse Notch1. The C-terminal half of mouse Notch2 RAMIC also exhibited TAD activity. Unexpectedly, the RBP-J chimeric protein with the Notch1 TAD failed to activate transcription but the activity was recovered by addition of either the RAM domain or ANK repeats. The results suggest that the activity of Notch1 TAD is repressed by fusion with RBP-J because of the presence of a RBP-J-associated co-repressor(s), which could be displaced by either the RAM domain or ANK repeats. Taken together, mouse Notch1 RAMIC can experimentally be separated into three functional domains: the RAM domain and ANK repeats for RBP-J binding and co-repressor displacement and the C-terminal TAD.

LEF1/TCFs are high mobility group box-containing transcriptional factors mediating canonical Wnt/beta-catenin signaling during early embryogenesis and tumorigenesis. Beta-catenin forms a complex with LEF1/TCFs and transactivates LEF1/TCF-mediated transcriptions during dorsalization. Although LEF-mediated transcription is also implicated in ventralization, the underlying molecular mechanism is not well understood. Using the vertebrate Xenopus laevis model system, we found that Xom, which is a ventralizing homeobox protein with dual roles of transcriptional activation and repression, forms a complex with LEF1/TCF through its homeodomain and transactivates LEF1/TCF-mediated transcription through its N-terminal transactivation domain (TAD). Our data show that Xom lacking the N-terminal TAD fails to transactivate ventral genes, such as BMP4 and Xom itself, but retains the ability to suppress transcriptional activation of dorsal gene promoters, such as the Goosecoid promoter, indicating that transactivation and repression are separable functions of Xom. It has been postulated that Xom forms a positive re-enforcement loop with BMP4 to promote ventralization and to suppress dorsal gene expression. Consistent with an essential role of Xom transactivation of LEF1/TCFs during early embryogenesis, we found that expression of the dominant-negative Xom mutant that lacks the TAD fails to re-enforce the ventral signaling of BMP4 and causes a catastrophic effect during gastrulation. Our data suggest that the functional interaction of Xom and LEF1/TCF-factors is essential for ventral cell fate determination and that LEF1/TCF factors may function as a point of convergence to mediate the combined signaling of Wnt/beta-catenin and BMP4/Xom pathways during early embryogenesis.

The c-Myc oncoprotein (Myc) is a DNA sequence-specific transcription factor that regulates transcription of a wide variety of genes involved in the control of cell growth, proliferation, differentiation, and apoptosis and its deregulated expression is implicated in many types of human cancer. Myc has an N-terminal transcription activation domain (TAD) that interacts with various coactivators and a C-terminal basic-helix-loop-helix-leucine zipper (bHLHZip) domain required for E box-specific DNA-binding and heterodimerization with its obligatory bHLHZip protein partner Max. The analysis of the mechanisms by which the Myc:Max complex regulates transcription at the molecular level in vitro has been hampered by the difficulty in obtaining highly pure recombinant Myc:Max heterodimers that contain full-length Myc with its complete TAD domain and that have sequence-specific DNA-binding activity. Here, we describe a simple method to reconstitute recombinant Myc:Max complexes from highly purified full-length proteins expressed in Escherichia coli that are soluble and highly active in E box-specific DNA-binding in vitro. The reconstituted Myc:Max complexes are stable and lack Max:Max homodimers. This procedure should facilitate the characterization of the DNA-binding and transcription activation functions of full-length Myc:Max complexes in vitro and in particular the role of Myc TAD-interacting cofactors and Myc:Max post-translational modifications.

The aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AhR) is a ligand-activated transcription factor that regulates transcription of a number of target genes upon binding ligands such as 2,3,7,8-tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin (TCDD). Large intra- and interspecies variations exist with respect to sensitivity to TCDD, and this could, at least in part, be due to a considerable variation in the AhR amino acid sequence between species. The N-terminal half of the AhR is well-conserved across species, whereas the C-terminal half exhibits a considerable degree of degeneracy. It has previously been shown that there are differences between the mouse (mAhR) and human AhR (hAhR) in terms of cellular localization, nucleocytoplasmic shuttling, the effect of chaperone proteins on these properties, and differences in relative ligand affinity. In this study, two chimeras were generated such that each had the N-terminal half of one receptor and the C-terminal half of the other receptor. The C-terminal half of the receptor, containing the transactivation domain, determines the cellular localization of the transiently transfected receptor and regulates the ability of hepatitis B virus X-associated protein 2 (XAP2) to inhibit ligand-independent nuclear import of AhR. In addition, the transactivation domain (TAD) appears to determine the presence of XAP2 in the nuclear ligand-bound AhR/hsp90 complex prior to association with the AhR nuclear translocator protein (ARNT). However, the transactivation domain does not appear to play a role in determining relative ligand affinity of the receptor, and mAhR and hAhR have similar overall transactivation potential in a cell-based reporter system at a saturating dose of ligand. This study demonstrates for the first time that the transactivation domain of the AhR influences important biochemical properties of the N-terminal half of the AhR, and the degeneracy in the transactivation domain between the mAhR and the hAhR results in species-specific differences in receptor properties.

The molecular circadian clock in mammals is generated from transcriptional activation by the bHLH-PAS transcription factor CLOCK-BMAL1 and subsequent repression by PERIOD and CRYPTOCHROME (CRY). The mechanism by which CRYs repress CLOCK-BMAL1 to close the negative feedback loop and generate 24-h timing is not known. Here we show that, in mouse fibroblasts, CRY1 competes for binding with coactivators to the intrinsically unstructured C-terminal transactivation domain (TAD) of BMAL1 to establish a functional switch between activation and repression of CLOCK-BMAL1. TAD mutations that alter affinities for co-regulators affect the balance of repression and activation to consequently change the intrinsic circadian period or eliminate cycling altogether. Our results suggest that CRY1 fulfills its role as an essential circadian repressor by sequestering the TAD from coactivators, and they highlight regulation of the BMAL1 TAD as a critical mechanism for establishing circadian timing.

ERM, PEA3 and ETV1 belong to the PEA3 group of ETS transcription factors. They are involved in many developmental processes and are transcriptional regulators in metastasis. The PEA3 group members share an N-terminal transactivation domain (TAD) whose activity is inhibited by a flanking domain named the negative regulatory domain (NRD). The mechanism of this inhibition is still unknown. Here we show that the NRD maps to residues 73 to 298 in ERM and contains three of the five SUMO sites previously identified in the protein. We demonstrate that these three SUMO sites are responsible for NRD's inhibitory function in the Gal4 system. Although the presence of the three sites is required to obtain maximal inhibition, only one SUMO site is sufficient to repress transcription whatever its localization within the NRD. We also show that NRD is a SUMO-dependent repression domain that can act in cis and in trans to downregulate the powerful TAD of the VP16 viral protein. In addition, we find that the SUMO sites outside the NRD also play a role in the negative regulation of full-length ERM activity. We thus postulate that each SUMO site in ERM may function as an inhibitory motif.

DBP, HLF and TEF comprise a distinct subfamily of mammalian bZIP proteins that plays an important role in regulation of tissue-specific gene expression, particularly in the liver. In this report we demonstrate that DBP contains a 38 amino acid TAD which is highly homologous to the HLF and TEF TADs that we have delineated previously. Deletion of this domain completely abrogates transcriptional activity of native DBP and GAL4-DBP fusion proteins. This domain functions as a modular TAD that is a potent transcriptional activator when fused to the GAL4 DBD. While DBP itself is a liver-specific transactivator, the DBP TAD is active in a variety of cell types, indicating that liver-specific activity is not an intrinsic property of the TAD and must be conferred by other regions of the protein. Using GAL4-HLF fusion proteins, we further refine the core TAD of PAR proteins to a region of 13 amino acids. Recently described PAR-bZIP proteins from Drosophila and zebrafish also contain domains that share strong homology with the TAD of mammalian PAR proteins, making this one of the most highly evolutionarily conserved TADs identified to date.

The basic helix-loop-helix-Per-ARNT-Sim-proteins hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF)-1alpha and HIF-2alpha are the principal regulators of the hypoxic transcriptional response. Although highly related, they can activate distinct target genes. In this study, the protein domain and molecular mechanism important for HIF target gene specificity are determined. We demonstrate that although HIF-2alpha is unable to activate multiple endogenous HIF-1alpha-specific target genes (e.g., glycolytic enzymes), HIF-2alpha still binds to their promoters in vivo and activates reporter genes derived from such targets. In addition, comparative analysis of the N-terminal DNA binding and dimerization domains of HIF-1alpha and HIF-2alpha does not reveal any significant differences between the two proteins. Importantly, replacement of the N-terminal transactivation domain (N-TAD) (but not the DNA binding domain, dimerization domain, or C-terminal transactivation domain [C-TAD]) of HIF-2alpha with the analogous region of HIF-1alpha is sufficient to convert HIF-2alpha into a protein with HIF-1alpha functional specificity. Nevertheless, both the N-TAD and C-TAD are important for optimal HIF transcriptional activity. Additional experiments indicate that the ETS transcription factor ELK is required for HIF-2alpha to activate specific target genes such as Cited-2, EPO, and PAI-1. These results demonstrate that the HIF-alpha TADs, particularly the N-TADs, confer HIF target gene specificity, by interacting with additional transcriptional cofactors.

E proteins are a special class of basic helix-loop-helix (bHLH) proteins that heterodimerize with many bHLH activators to regulate developmental decisions, such as myogenesis and neurogenesis. Daughterless (Da) is the sole E protein in Drosophila and is ubiquitously expressed. We have characterized two transcription activation domains (TADs) in Da, called activation domain 1 (AD1) and loop-helix (LH), and have evaluated their roles in promoting peripheral neurogenesis. In this context, Da heterodimerizes with proneural proteins, such as Scute (Sc), which is dynamically expressed and also contributes a TAD. We found that either one of the Da TADs in the Da/Sc complex is sufficient to promote neurogenesis, whereas the Sc TAD is incapable of doing so. Besides its transcriptional activation role, the Da AD1 domain serves as an interaction platform for E(spl) proteins, bHLH-Orange family repressors which antagonize Da/Sc function. We show that the E(spl) Orange domain is needed for this interaction and strongly contributes to the antiproneural activity of E(spl) proteins. We present a mechanistic model on the interplay of these bHLH factors in the context of neural fate assignment.

The NF-κB transcription factor family plays a central role in innate immunity and inflammation processes and is frequently dysregulated in cancer. We developed an NF-κB functional assay in yeast to investigate the following issues: transactivation specificity of NF-κB proteins acting as homodimers or heterodimers; correlation between transactivation capacity and in vitro DNA binding measurements; impact of co-expressed interacting proteins or of small molecule inhibitors on NF-κB-dependent transactivation. Full-length p65 and p50 cDNAs were cloned into centromeric expression vectors under inducible GAL1 promoter in order to vary their expression levels. Since p50 lacks a transactivation domain (TAD), a chimeric construct containing the TAD derived from p65 was also generated (p50TAD) to address its binding and transactivation potential. The p50TAD and p65 had distinct transactivation specificities towards seventeen different κB response elements (κB-REs) where single nucleotide changes could greatly impact transactivation. For four κB-REs, results in yeast were predictive of transactivation potential measured in the human MCF7 cell lines treated with the NF-κB activator TNFα. Transactivation results in yeast correlated only partially with in vitro measured DNA binding affinities, suggesting that features other than strength of interaction with naked DNA affect transactivation, although factors such as chromatin context are kept constant in our isogenic yeast assay. The small molecules BAY11-7082 and ethyl-pyruvate as well as expressed IkBα protein acted as NF-κB inhibitors in yeast, more strongly towards p65. Thus, the yeast-based system can recapitulate NF-κB features found in human cells, thereby providing opportunities to address various NF-κB functions, interactions and chemical modulators.

NF-κB plays a vital role in cellular immune and inflammatory response, survival, and proliferation by regulating the transcription of various genes involved in these processes. To activate transcription, RelA (a prominent NF-κB family member) interacts with transcriptional co-activators like CREB-binding protein (CBP) and its paralog p300 in addition to its cognate κB sites on the promoter/enhancer regions of DNA. The RelA:CBP/p300 complex is comprised of two components--first, DNA binding domain of RelA interacts with the KIX domain of CBP/p300, and second, the transcriptional activation domain (TAD) of RelA binds to the TAZ1 domain of CBP/p300. A phosphorylation event of a well-conserved RelA(Ser276) is prerequisite for the former interaction to occur and is considered a decisive factor for the overall RelA:CBP/p300 interaction. The role of the latter interaction in the transcription of RelA-activated genes remains unclear. Here we provide the solution structure of the latter component of the RelA:CBP complex by NMR spectroscopy. The structure reveals the folding of RelA-TA2 (a section of TAD) upon binding to TAZ1 through its well-conserved hydrophobic sites in a series of grooves on the TAZ1 surface. The structural analysis coupled with the mechanistic studies by mutational and isothermal calorimetric analyses allowed the design of RelA-mutants that selectively abrogated the two distinct components of the RelA:CBP/p300 interaction. Detailed studies of these RelA mutants using cell-based techniques, mathematical modeling, and genome-wide gene expression analysis showed that a major set of the RelA-activated genes, larger than previously believed, is affected by this interaction. We further show how the RelA:CBP/p300 interaction controls the nuclear response of NF-κB through the negative feedback loop of NF-κB pathway. Additionally, chromatin analyses of RelA target gene promoters showed constitutive recruitment of CBP/p300, thus indicating a possible role of CBP/p300 in recruitment of RelA to its target promoter sites.

The p53 protein exerts its tumor suppressive function mainly by acting as a transcription activator. Two transactivation domains (TADs) located at the amino-terminus of p53 are required for transcription activation, and the activity of TADs is tightly regulated by post-translational modifications, such as phosphorylation. We attempted to dissect the functions of the two TADs and phosphorylation within the TADs by analyzing p53 target genes induced by full-length p53 (FL-p53), N-terminally deleted p53 isoform lacking the first TAD (Delta1stTAD) and p53 carrying point mutations at all serine residues within the two TADs (TAD-S/A). By performing a comprehensive survey by employing microarray expression analysis, the induction of target genes by FL-p53, Delta1stTAD and TAD-S/A was analyzed. All p53s showed different target gene induction patterns, suggesting the importance of the two TADs and phosphorylation within the TADs in target gene induction. Although Delta1stTAD showed a marked decrease in the ability to induce genes induced by FL-p53, Delta1stTAD induced many apoptosis-related genes that were not induced by FL-p53, suggesting the roles of these Delta1stTAD-induced genes in Delta1stTAD-dependent apoptosis. Approximately 80% of genes induced by FL-p53 were not induced by TAD-S/A, including 29 previously reported p53 target genes such as Hdm2 and Bax, emphasizing the importance of phosphorylation within the TADs. These results demonstrate the significance of the regulation and differential roles of the N-terminal TADs in p53 transcriptional activity.

The epidermal growth factor receptor family member HER4 undergoes proteolytic processing at the cell surface to release the HER4 intracellular domain (4ICD) nuclear protein. Interestingly, 4ICD directly interacts with STAT5 and functions as an obligate STAT5 nuclear chaperone. Once in the nucleus 4ICD binds with STAT5 at STAT5 target genes, dramatically potentiating STAT5 transcriptional activation. These observations raise the possibility that 4ICD directly coactivates STAT5 gene expression. Using both yeast and mammalian transactivation reporter assays, we performed truncations of 4ICD fused to a GAL4 DNA binding domain and identified two independent 4ICD transactivation domains located between residues 1022 and 1090 (TAD1) and 1192 and 1225 (TAD2). The ability of the 4ICD DNA binding domain fusions to transactivate reporter gene expression required deletion of the intrinsic tyrosine kinase domain. In addition, we identified the 4ICD carboxyl terminal TVV residues, a PDZ domain binding motif (PDZ-DBM), as a potent transcriptional repressor. The transactivation activity of the HER4 carboxyl terminal domain lacking the tyrosine kinase (CTD) was significantly lower than similar EGFR or HER2 CTD. However, deletion of the HER4 CTD PDZ-DBM enhanced HER4 CTD transactivation to levels equivalent to the EGFR and HER2 CTDs. To determine if 4ICD TAD1 and TAD2 have a physiologically relevant role in STAT5 transactivation, we coexpressed 4ICD or 4ICD lacking TAD2 or both TAD1 and TAD2 with STAT5 in a luciferase reporter assay. Our results demonstrate that each 4ICD TAD contributes additively to STAT5A transactivation and the ability of STAT5A to transactivate the β-casein promoter requires the 4ICD TADs. Taken together, published data and our current results demonstrate that both 4ICD nuclear chaperone and intrinsic coactivation activities are essential for STAT5 regulated gene expression.

Posttranslational modifications have critical roles in diverse biological processes through interactions. Tumor-suppressor protein p53 and nucleotide excision repair factor XPC each contain an acidic region, termed the acidic transactivation domain (TAD) and acidic fragment (AF), respectively, that binds to the pleckstrin homology (PH) domain of the p62 subunit of the transcription factor TFIIH. Human p53-TAD contains seven serine and two threonine residues, all of which can be phosphorylated. Similarly, XPC-AF contains six serine and two threonine residues, of which Thr117, Ser122 and Ser129 have been reported as phosphorylation sites in vivo, although their phosphorylation roles are unknown. Phosphorylation of Ser46 and Thr55 of p53-TAD increases its binding ability; however, the role of XPC-AF phosphorylation remains elusive. Here we describe a system for real-time and simultaneous monitoring of the phosphorylation and p62-PH affinity of p53-TAD and XPC-AF using nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy. Unexpectedly, among seven reported kinases that presumably phosphorylate Ser46 and/or Thr55 of p53-TAD, only two specific and high-efficiency enzymes were identified: JNK2α2 for Ser46 and GRK5 for Thr55. During interaction with p62-PH, four different affinity complexes resulting from various phosphorylation states of p53-TAD by the kinases were identified. The kinetics of the site-specific phosphorylation reaction of p53-TAD and its affinity for p62-PH were monitored in real-time using the NMR system. Isothermic calorimetry showed that phosphorylation of Ser129 of XPC-AF increases binding to p62-PH. Although CK2 was predicted to phosphorylate Ser122, Ser129 and Ser140 from its sequence context, it specifically and efficiently phosphorylated only Ser129. Simultaneous monitoring of the phosphorylation and augmentation in p62-PH binding identified a key residue of p62-PH for contacting phosphorylated Ser129. In summary, we have established an NMR system for real-time and simultaneous monitoring of site-specific phosphorylation and enhancement of affinity between phosphorylation domains and their target. The system is also applicable to other posttranslational modifications.

The amino terminus of the avian myelocytomatosis virus MC29 v-Myc oncoprotein contains sequences that are essential for cellular transformation (S. Farina, et al. J. Virol., 66: 2698-2708, 1992; S. Min and E. J. Taparowsky. Oncogene, 7:1531-1540, 1992) and for the ability to activate gene transcription (S. Min and E. J. Taparowsky. Oncogene, 7:1531-1540, 1992). To investigate the molecular interactions that mediate these v-Myc-associated activities, we performed competition assays in which various regions of the v-Myc amino terminal transcription activation domain (TAD) were examined for their ability to inhibit transcription activation by v-Myc, VP16, and the myogenic regulatory factor MyoD. Overexpression of these transcriptional activators also was used to investigate whether Myc-interacting proteins were required for cellular transformation and cell proliferation events. Our results demonstrate that at least two distinct cellular activities interact with the v-Myc TAD and that it is the synergism between these activities that is required for v-Myc to function fully as a transcriptional activator. In addition, v-Myc activators squelch VP16- and MyoD-dependent transcription activation, suggesting that the v-Myc TAD interacts with a component of the general transcription machinery. In support of this observation, we found that overexpression of the v-Myc TAD inhibits ras-mediated cellular transformation as well as cell proliferation, underscoring the critical role these amino terminal Myc-interacting factors play in regulating the physiology of both normal and transformed cells.

Infection with the Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) can lead to a number of human diseases including Hodgkin's and Burkitt's lymphomas. The development of these EBV-linked diseases is associated with the presence of nine viral latent proteins, including the nuclear antigen 2 (EBNA2). The EBNA2 protein plays a crucial role in EBV infection through its ability to activate transcription of both host and viral genes. As part of this function, EBNA2 associates with several host transcriptional regulatory proteins, including the Tfb1/p62 (yeast/human) subunit of the general transcription factor IIH (TFIIH) and the histone acetyltransferase CBP(CREB-binding protein)/p300, through interactions with its C-terminal transactivation domain (TAD). In this manuscript, we examine the interaction of the acidic TAD of EBNA2 (residues 431-487) with the Tfb1/p62 subunit of TFIIH and CBP/p300 using nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy, isothermal titration calorimeter (ITC) and transactivation studies in yeast. NMR studies show that the TAD of EBNA2 binds to the pleckstrin homology (PH) domain of Tfb1 (Tfb1PH) and that residues 448-471 (EBNA2₄₄₈₋₄₇₁) are necessary and sufficient for this interaction. NMR structural characterization of a Tfb1PH-EBNA2₄₄₈₋₄₇₁ complex demonstrates that the intrinsically disordered TAD of EBNA2 forms a 9-residue α-helix in complex with Tfb1PH. Within this helix, three hydrophobic amino acids (Trp458, Ile461 and Phe462) make a series of important interactions with Tfb1PH and their importance is validated in ITC and transactivation studies using mutants of EBNA2. In addition, NMR studies indicate that the same region of EBNA2 is also required for binding to the KIX domain of CBP/p300. This study provides an atomic level description of interactions involving the TAD of EBNA2 with target host proteins. In addition, comparison of the Tfb1PH-EBNA2₄₄₈₋₄₇₁ complex with structures of the TAD of p53 and VP16 bound to Tfb1PH highlights the versatility of intrinsically disordered acidic TADs in recognizing common target host proteins.

Physical interaction between the transactivation domain (TAD) of the mixed-lineage leukemia protein (MLL) and the KIX domain of the cyclic-AMP response element binding protein (CREB) binding protein (CBP) is necessary for MLL-mediated transcriptional activation. We show by alanine-scanning mutagenesis that hydrophobic surface residues of KIX, especially L628, are energetically important for binding the MLL TAD. NMR studies of the KIX-L628A mutant suggest that L628 plays a crucial role in conformational transitions at the MLL binding site, necessary for high affinity interactions with MLL. Unexpectedly, MLL also binds to the c-Myb/phosphorylated kinase-inducible domain of CREB (pKID) site of KIX, highlighting the complex nature of interactions involving intrinsically disordered transcriptional activators.

Molecular interactions between the tumor suppressor p53 and the transcriptional coactivators CBP/p300 are critical for the regulation of p53 transactivation and stability. The transactivation domain (TAD) of p53 binds directly to several CBP/p300 domains (TAZ1, TAZ2, NCBD, and KIX). Here we map the interaction between the p53 TAD and the CBP KIX domain using isothermal titration calorimetry and NMR spectroscopy. KIX is a structural domain in CBP/p300 that can simultaneously bind two polypeptide ligands, such as the activation domain of MLL and the kinase-inducible activation domain (pKID) of CREB, using distinct interaction surfaces. The p53 TAD consists of two subdomains (AD1 and AD2); peptides corresponding to the isolated AD1 and AD2 subdomains interact with KIX with relatively low affinity, but a longer peptide containing both subdomains binds KIX tightly. In the context of the full-length p53 TAD, AD1 and AD2 bind synergistically to KIX. Mapping of the chemical shift perturbations onto the structure of KIX shows that isolated AD1 and AD2 peptides bind to both the MLL and pKID sites. Spin-labeling experiments show that the complex of the full-length p53 TAD with KIX is disordered, with the AD1 and AD2 subdomains each interacting with both the MLL and pKID binding surfaces. Phosphorylation of the p53 TAD at Thr18 or Ser20 increases the KIX binding affinity. The affinity is further enhanced by simultaneous phosphorylation of Thr18 and Ser20, and the specificity of the interaction is increased. The p53 TAD simultaneously occupies the two distinct sites that have been identified on the CBP KIX domain and efficiently competes for these sites with other known KIX-binding transcription factors.

To assess the importance of transactivation domains (TAD), DNA binding and transcription on the degradation of the AH receptor (AHR), Hepa-1 cells were pre-treated with actinomycin D (AD) or cycloheximide (CHX) and exposed to 2,3,7,8 tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin (TCDD). AD or CHX did not affect nuclear localization or DNA binding of the AHR but inhibited ligand-induced degradation. In contrast, AD or CHX did not inhibit geldanamycin (GA) induced degradation of the AHR. To assess the role of the COOH-terminal TAD in AHR degradation, stop codons were placed at nucleotide 1501 and 1921 of the Ah(b-1) AHR coding region to generate AHR(500) and AHR(640). Stable cell lines were generated and exposed to TCDD. Cells expressing AHR(500) did not induce CYP1A1 protein, but exhibited significant degradation of AHR(500). Cells expressing AHR(640) induced CYP1A1 protein to 50% of the level of cells expressing wild type AHR and exhibited significant degradation of AHR(640). Importantly, AD and CHX did not inhibit the TCDD-induced degradation of either AHR(500) and AHR(640) and these receptors showed a more rapid profile of ligand-induced degradation compared to cells expressing wild type AHR. TCDD exposure to Hepa-1 cells with reduced aryl hydrocarbon receptor nuclear translocator (ARNT), showed ligand-induced degradation of the AHR that was not blocked by AD. However, AD inhibited TCDD-induced degradation when ARNT expression was restored. These results show that multiple mechanisms exist for the ligand and GA-induced degradation of the AHR and suggest that ligand-induced degradation can switch between two mechanisms depending on the presence of a functional TAD and the binding to DNA.

Potent induction of the gene coding for human prointerleukin 1beta (il1b) normally requires a far-upstream inducible enhancer in addition to a minimal promoter located between positions -131 and +12. The transcription factor Spi-1 (also called PU.1) is necessary for expression and binds to the minimal promoter, thus providing an essential transcription activation domain (TAD). In contrast, infection by human cytomegalovirus (HCMV) can strongly activate il1b via the expression of immediate early (IE) viral proteins and eliminates the requirement for the upstream enhancer. Spi-1 has been circumstantially implicated as a host factor in this process. We report here the molecular basis for the direct involvement of Spi-1 in HCMV activation of il1b. Transfection of Spi-1-deficient HeLa cells demonstrated both the requirement of Spi-1 for IE activity and the need for a shorter promoter (-59 to +12) than that required in the absence of IE proteins. Furthermore, in contrast to normal, enhancer-dependent il1b expression, which absolutely requires both the Spi-1 winged helix-turn-helix (wHTH) DNA-binding domain and the majority of the Spi-1 TAD, il1b expression in the presence of IE proteins does not require the Spi-1 TAD, which plays a synergistic role. In addition, we demonstrate that a single IE protein, IE2, is critical for the induction of il1b. Protein-protein interaction experiments revealed that the wing motif within the Spi-1 wHTH domain directly recruits IE2. In turn, IE2 physically associates with the Spi-1 wing and requires the integrity of at least one region of IE2. Functional analysis demonstrates that both this region and a carboxy-terminal acidic TAD are required for IE2 function. Therefore, we propose a protein-tethered transactivation mechanism in which the il1b promoter-bound Spi-1 wHTH tethers IE2, which provides a TAD, resulting in the transactivation of il1b.

The transcriptional coactivator p300 is highly expressed in breast cancer tissues. MRTF-A is a transcription factor governed by the Rho-GTPase-actin signaling pathway. The purpose of this study was to explore the role of p300 in breast cancer metastasis. Here we showed that the motility of breast cancer cells was enhanced by the overexpression of p300, meanwhile, the transcription of migration-related genes was upregulated. Depletion of p300 downregulated the migration-related genes and slowed down the migration of breast cancer cells. p300 worked synergistically with MRTF-A to activate the transcription of MYH9, MYL9 and CYR61. As identified by co-IP, p300 interacted with the C-terminal TAD domain of MRTF-A. And together with MRTF-A, p300 was associated with the target gene promoters. Furthermore, MRTF-A was found to be acetylated in MCF-7 breast cancer cells. These results demonstrated the involvement of p300 in the MRTF-A mediated gene regulation and breast cancer cell migration.

The adenovirus E1B 55-kDa protein is a potent inhibitor of p53-mediated transactivation and apoptosis. The proposed mechanisms include tethering the E1B repression domain to p53-responsive promoters via direct E1B-p53 interaction. Cytoplasmic sequestration of p53 by the 55-kDa protein would impose additional inhibition on p53-mediated effects. To investigate further the role of cytoplasmic sequestration of p53 in its inhibition by the E1B 55-kDa protein we systematically examined domains in both the Ad12 55-kDa protein and p53 that underpin their colocalization in the cytoplasmic body and show that the N-terminal transactivation domain (TAD) of p53 is essential for retaining p53 in the cytoplasmic body. Deletion of amino acids 11 to 27 or even point mutation L22Q/W23S abolished the localization of p53 to the cytoplasmic body, whereas other parts of TAD and the C-terminal domain of p53 are dispensable. This cytoplasmic body is distinct from aggresome associated with overexpression of some proteins, since it neither altered vimentin intermediate filaments nor associated with centrosome or ubiquitin. Formation of this structure is sensitive to mutation of the Ad12 55-kDa protein. Strikingly, mutation S476/477A near the C terminus of the Ad12 55-kDa protein eliminated the formation of the cytoplasmic body. The equivalent residues in the Ad5 55-kDa protein were shown to be critical for its ability to inhibit p53. Indeed, Ad12 55-kDa mutants that cannot form a cytoplasmic body can no longer inhibit p53-mediated effects. Conversely, the Ad12 55-kDa protein does not suppress p53 mutant L22Q/W23S-mediated apoptosis. Finally, we show that E1B can still sequester p53 that contains the mitochondrial import sequence, thereby potentially preventing the localization of p53 to mitochondria. Thus, cytoplasmic sequestration of p53 by the E1B 55-kDa protein plays an important role in restricting p53 activities.

Escherichia coli BL21 (DE3) is commonly used for the overproduction of fusion proteins. Using this system, we recently reported the overproduction of histidine-tagged mouse estrogen receptor (ER) alpha-ligand binding domain as an intact 30 kD protein and its inhibitory effect on the growth of bacteria. However, when GST-tagged mouse ERalpha transactivation domain (TAD) was overproduced using this system, it showed no effect on the growth of bacteria but was specifically degraded during its expression and purification. Here we report the expression of 47 kD GST-tagged mouse ERalpha-TAD protein, which was degraded partially and specifically into 46 and 43 kD fragments. This fusion protein was further degraded into 37, 31, 29 and 26 kD fragments during its purification by affinity chromatography. Such specific degradation of GST-tagged mouse ERalpha-TAD during its overproduction in E. coli and purification indicates the induction of specific protease and suggests the modification of expression system.

The aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AhR) is an intracellular receptor protein that regulates gene transcription in response to both man-made and natural ligands. A modular transactivaton domain (TAD) has been mapped to the 304 C-terminal amino acids and consists of acidic, Q-rich, and P/S/T-rich subdomains. We have used steady-state intrinsic tryptophan fluorescence and circular dichroism spectroscopy to investigate the conformation of the acidic Q-rich region. The results reveal that this region of the protein is structurally flexible but adopts a more folded conformation in the presence of the natural osmolyte trimethylamine N-oxide (TMAO) and the solvent trifluoroethanol (TFE). In protein-protein interaction studies, the acidic Q-rich region bound to components of the general transcription machinery [TATA-binding protein (TBP), TAF4, and TAF6] as well as the coactivator proteins SRC-1a and TIF2. The binding site for TBP mapped to the acidic subdomain, while SRC-1a bound preferentially to the Q-rich sequence. Significantly, the binding of TBP was modulated by induced folding of the TAD with TMAO. The results indicate that the AhR TAD makes multiple interactions with the transcriptional machinery and protein conformation plays a critical role in receptor function. Taken together, these findings support a role for protein folding in AhR action and suggest possible mechanisms of receptor-dependent gene activation.

Basic helix-loop-helix (bHLH) transcription factors play diverse roles in controlling many developmental events. Although a great deal is understood about how bHLH factors activate gene transcription via E-box DNA consensus sequences, studies of bHLH factor function in higher eukaryotes often have been hindered by the presence of multiple family members. As a first step in developing a simplified in vivo system to examine bHLH factor activities, we examined whether the bHLH muscle regulatory factors MRF4 and MyoD function appropriately in yeast. We show that Gal4-MRF4 fusion proteins, or native MRF4 proteins, activate expression of an E-box HIS3 reporter gene whereas MyoD proteins remain inactive. Deletion of the MRF4 transcription activation domain (TAD) or point mutations that abolish MRF4 DNA interactions inhibit HIS3 expression. Substitution of the MRF4 TAD with the Gal4 TAD also produces a functional protein, demonstrating that these transcription activation domains are functionally equivalent in yeast. Replacement of the MRF4 TAD with the related MyoD TAD, however, generates an inactive protein, suggesting that some specificity exists between bHLH family members. Using this experimental system, we also demonstrate that mammalian cDNA libraries can be screened successfully for cDNAs encoding novel bHLH proteins that interact with E-box targets. Thus, this in vivo yeast system provides a novel approach to facilitate functional studies of bHLH factor regulation.

Signal transducer and activator of transcription (Stat5) is a transcription factor, which transduces extracellular cytokine and growth-factor signals to the nuclei of mammalian cells. As a major mediator of prolactin action, it is involved in the regulation of the development, function, and survival of mammary epithelial cells. The carboxyl terminal of Stat5 encodes a transactivation domain (TAD), which interacts with coactivators and is crucial for the transcriptional induction of Stat5 target genes. To study the role of the Stat5 TAD in mediating Stat5 functions, a carboxy terminally truncated Stat5 variant (Stat5Delta750) was directed for expression in the mammary glands of transgenic mice by regulatory sequences of the beta-lactoglobulin (BLG) gene. Expression of Stat5Delta750 in mammary tissue reduced the rates of cell proliferation at mid and late pregnancy. Subsequently, morphological signs of milk secretion upon parturition were delayed. In double-transgenic mice, expression of Stat5Delta750 drastically decreased BLG/luciferase activity during lactation, but did not affect the expression and secretion of the endogenous beta-casein or alpha-lactalbumin into the milk. Expression of Stat5Delta750 also caused an increase in the number of apoptotic cells during mammary involution by a factor of 3 relative to control glands. Our data established a role for the Stat5 TAD in mediating the effects of Stat5 on mammary development, regulation of milk protein gene activity, and cell survival. The full effects of Stat5Delta750 may be partially buffered by the expression of endogenous wild-type Stat5 and the formation of truncated and wild-type heterodimers.

The proto-oncogene c-myc governs the expression of a number of genes targeting cell growth and apoptosis, and its expression levels are distorted in many cancer forms. The current investigation presents an analysis by proteolysis, circular dichroism, fluorescence and Biacore of the folding and ligand-binding properties of the N-terminal transactivation domain (TAD) in the c-Myc protein. A c-Myc sub-region comprising residues 1-167 (Myc1-167) has been investigated that includes the unstructured c-Myc transactivation domain (TAD, residues 1-143) together with a C-terminal segment, which appears to promote increased folding. Myc1-167 is partly helical, binds both to the target proteins Myc modulator-1 (MM-1) and TATA box-binding protein (TBP), and displays the characteristics of a molten globule. Limited proteolysis divides Myc1-167 in two halves, by cleaving in a predicted linker region between two hotspot mutation regions: Myc box I (MBI) and Myc box II (MBII). The N-terminal half (Myc1-88) is unfolded and does not alone bind to target proteins, whereas the C-terminal half (Myc92-167) has a partly helical fold and specifically binds both MM-1 and TBP. Although this might suggest a bipartite organization in the c-Myc TAD, none of the N and C-terminal fragments bind target protein with as high affinity as the entire Myc1-167, or display molten globule properties. Furthermore, merely linking the MBI with the C-terminal region, in Myc38-167, is not sufficient to achieve binding and folding properties as in Myc1-167. Thus, the entire N and C-terminal regions of c-Myc TAD act in concert to achieve high specificity and affinity to two structurally and functionally orthogonal target proteins, TBP and MM-1, possibly through a mechanism involving molten globule formation. This hints towards understanding how binding of a range of targets can be accomplished to a single transactivation domain.

In the presence of 2,3,7,8-tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin (TCDD) and related chemicals, the Ah receptor nuclear translocator (Arnt) forms a heterodimeric complex with the ligand-bound Ah receptor, leading to recognition of dioxin-responsive elements within the enhancer of the CYP1A1 gene and transcription activation by an unknown mechanism. To understand the role of Arnt in transcription activation by the Ah receptor-Arnt heterodimer, we performed a deletion analysis of Arnt to locate domains that are directly involved in transcription activation. We showed that the C-terminal 34 amino acids of Arnt encode a transcription activation domain (TAD) that functions independently of other sequences in the Ah receptor complex when attached to the heterologous Gal4 DNA binding domain. Deletion of the C-terminal acidic-rich 14 amino acids completely abolishes activity. Sequences important in Arnt TAD function were independent of the glutamine-rich region which is an important structural feature in the TAD of other transcription factors. The strength of the Arnt TAD when compared with the strong TAD from the herpes simplex virus VP16 protein was cell-type specific. Both the Arnt and VP16 TAD were equally strong in COS-1 cells, but the Arnt TAD had weak activity in an Arnt-deficient mouse hepatoma cell line and was not needed for restoration of CYP1A1 activation. These results imply that for CYP1A1 activation the Ah receptor provides the dominant activation function for the heterodimer in hepatoma cells. The potential of the Arnt TAD to contribute to activation by the Ah receptor complex is likely determined by availability or activity of cell-specific factors with which the TAD interacts.

The proteins belonging to the nuclear factor of activated T cells (NFAT) family of transcription factors are expressed in several cell types and regulate genes involved in differentiation, cell cycle and apoptosis. NFAT proteins share two conserved domains, the NFAT-homology region (NHR) and a DNA-binding domain (DBD). The N- and C-termini display two transactivation domains (TAD-N and TAD-C) that have low sequence similarity. Due to the high sequence conservation in the NHR and DBD, NFAT members have some overlapping roles in gene regulation. However, several studies have shown distinct roles for NFAT proteins in the regulation of cell death. The TAD-C shows low sequence similarity among NFAT family members, but its contribution to specific NFAT1-induced phenotypes is poorly understood. Here, we described at least two regions of NFAT1 TAD-C that confer pro-apoptotic activity to NFAT1. These regions extend from amino acids 699 to 734 and 819 to 850 of NFAT1. We also showed that the NFAT1 TAD-C is unable to induce apoptosis by itself and requires a functional DBD. Furthermore, we showed that when fused to NFAT1 TAD-C, NFAT2, which is associated with cell transformation, induces apoptosis in fibroblasts. Together, these results suggest that the NFAT1 TAD-C includes NFAT death domains that confer to different NFAT members the ability to induce apoptosis.
