How can the expression of SerH3 immobilization antigen be regulated?

[PMID: 2854007]
The surfaces of Tetrahymena thermophila cells grown between 20 and 35 degrees C are covered by one or more variants of H antigens. A cDNA clone, pC6, has previously been identified that hybridizes to a unique polyA+ RNA that appears to code for the SerH3 variant of the H antigens. pC6 and a subclone of it, pGpC6.295, were used to analyze the genomic organization of the corresponding gene(s) in both the macronucleus and the micronucleus. It was determined that pC6 hybridizes to a small family of sequences in the macronucleus, only one of which also hybridizes to pGpC6.295. The latter is a strong candidate for the gene encoding the SerH3 antigen. Sequences homologous to pC6 - but not to pGpC6.295 - are present in strains carrying the other SerH alleles. Shifts in antigen switching during vegetative growth do not result in any detectable DNA rearrangements in the vicinity of the pC6-hybridizing sequence family. Analysis of micronuclear DNA from a homozygous SerH3 strain revealed that it also contains a family of sequences that are homologous to pC6; but, in contrast to the macronuclear DNA, two members of this micronuclear sequence family hybridize to pGpC6.295. Comparison of micro- and macronuclear DNA indicate that some members of the pC6-positive sequence family rearrange during macronuclear development. These rearrangements fall into two classes: those which occur reproducibly, and those which show variability. The gene homologous to pGp6.295 falls into the former category.

The presence of specific proteins (known as immobilization antigens) on the surface of the ciliated protozoan Tetrahymena thermophila is under environmental regulation. There are five different classes (serotypes) of surface proteins which appear on the cell surface when T. thermophila is cultured under different conditions of temperature or incubation medium; three of these are temperature dependent. The appearance of these proteins on the cell surface is mutually exclusive. We used polyclonal antibodies raised against 30 degrees C (designated SerH3)- and 40 degrees C (designated SerT)-specific surface antigens to study their structure and expression. We showed that these surface proteins contain at least one disulfide bridge. On sodium dodecyl sulfate-denaturing polyacrylamide gels, the nonreduced 30 degrees C- and 40 degrees C-specific surface proteins migrated with molecular sizes of 69 and 36 kilodaltons, respectively. The reduced forms of the proteins migrated with molecular sizes of 58 and 30 kilodaltons, respectively. The synthesis of the surface proteins responded rapidly and with a time course similar to that of the incubation temperature. The synthesis of each surface protein was greatly reduced within 1 h and undetectable by 2 h after a shift to the temperature at which the protein is not expressed. Surface protein synthesis resumed by the end of 1 h after a shift to the temperature at which the protein is expressed. The temperature-dependent induction of these surface proteins appears to be dependent on the synthesis of new mRNA, as indicated by a sensitivity to actinomycin D. Surface protein syntheses were mutually exclusive except at a transition temperature. At 35 degrees C both surface proteins were synthesized by a cell population. These data support the potential of this system as a model for the study of the effects of environmental factors on the genetic regulation of cell surface proteins.

A temperature shift from 40 to 28 degrees C rapidly induced expression of a specific immobilization antigen at the cell surface in Tetrahymena thermophila. This transformation was inhibited by actinomycin D and cycloheximide but not by colchicine or cytochalasin B. The major surface antigen expressed at 28 degrees C in cells homozygous for the SerH3 allele was partially purified, and an antiserum against this preparation was raised in rabbits. Electrophoresis, immunoblot, and [35S]methionine incorporation studies are reported which support the conclusion that the H3 antigen is an acidic protein with an Mr of approximately 52,000 daltons. An induced synthesis of the H3 immobilization antigen was detected within 30 min after a shift from 40 to 28 degrees C. This protein appeared to be synthesized in the microsomal fraction and transferred without cleavage to the cell surface, where it was inserted first into nonciliated regions.

The Ser genes of Tetrahymena thermophila specify alternative forms of a major cell surface glycoprotein, the immobilization or i-antigen (i-ag). Regulation of i-ag expression assures that at least one i-ag gene is expressed at all times. To learn more about the regulatory system and the possible role of i-ag itself, we studied SerH3-ts1, a temperature-sensitive allele of the temperature-regulated SerH3 gene normally expressed from 20-36 degrees. In homozygotes grown at the nonpermissive temperature (> 32 degrees), H3 is not present on the cell surface, but the gene continues to be transcribed until its 36 degrees cutoff. H3 formed at the permissive temperature is stable at nonpermissive temperatures, indicating that SerH3-ts1 is temperature-sensitive for synthesis rather than function. At nonpermissive temperatures, the S i-ag is expressed in place of H3. This result suggests that normal H protein may play a role in regulating S expression. SerH3-ts1 was isolated following mutagenesis with N-methyl-N'-nitro-N-nitrosoguanidine (MNNG). Sequencing of SerH3-ts1 revealed a single A --> G transition at nucleotide 473, resulting in the substitution of glycine for aspartate. The affected residue is conserved in the internal repeats comprising the H protein, and the charge difference correlates with changes in electrophoretic mobility of the H3 protein.

Multiple alleles at the SerH locus specify the major cell surface protein (immobilization antigen) of the ciliate Tetrahymena thermophila. Following mutagenesis of SerH1 homozygotes, two mutations, H1-1 and H1-2, were recovered in heterozygous form. Mutant homozygotes do not express H1 antigen, nor is H1 expressed in F1 progeny of crosses to wild-type strains homozygous for SerH2 or SerH3. H1-1 and H1-2 segregate without recombination from these wild-type alleles in expected F2 and testcross Mendelian ratios. H1-1 and H1-2 do, however, complement each other to express H1 antigen. Experiments suggest this complementation is due neither to recombination during macronuclear development nor to interallelic complementation of defective SerH1 gene products. These results suggest that SerH1 is intact in one mutant, and possibly both, although no such allele has been segregated in testcross progeny (N = 205). The hypothesis is presented that complementation between H1-1 and H1-2 is due to interaction between allele-specific regulators closely linked to the SerH1 gene.

The DNA sequences of a cDNA clone and the macronuclear genomic fragment corresponding to the functional copy of the SerH3 surface antigen gene of Tetrahymena thermophila were determined. Primer extension and nuclease protection assays show that the SerH3 transcription unit is 1,425 nucleotides long and contains no introns. The predicted polypeptide encoded by the SerH3 gene has a molecular mass of 44,415 daltons; one-third of its 439 residues are either cysteine, serine, or threonine. The central half of the polypeptide consists of three homologous domains in tandem array; within these domains, the cysteine, proline, and tryptophan residues occur in highly regular patterns.

In Tetrahymena thermophila, the expression of a temperature-specific surface protein known as SerH3 is primarily controlled by a temperature-dependent change in the stability of the mRNA that encodes this protein. At 30 degrees C the SerH3 mRNA displays a half-life of 60 minutes while at 40 degrees C the half-life decreases to only 3 minutes. We used a Tetrahymena mutant cell line (rseB) defective in expression of SerH3 at 30 degrees C to explore the mechanisms involved in temperature-dependent mRNA stability. The results of in vitro nuclear run-off assays and Northern and slot blot analysis of cytoplasmic and nuclear RNAs show that the rseB locus encodes a temperature-sensitive product that has no effect on SerH3 gene transcription or the steady-state levels of SerH3 nuclear RNA. However, the product of this locus does have a dramatic effect on cytoplasmic levels of the SerH3 mRNA at 30 degrees C, indicating that SerH3 gene expression is affected post-transcriptionally within the cytoplasm. To explore the possibility that the rseB locus controls SerH3 mRNA stability we developed an in vitro mRNA decay assay. This assay successfully duplicates the differential decay of the SerH3 mRNA observed in wild-type cells grown at different temperatures. The apparent half-life of the SerH3 mRNA in cytoplasmic extracts derived from cells grown at 30 degrees C is approximately 45 minutes while in cytoplasmic extracts derived from cells grown at 40 degrees C it is only 6 minutes. When similar experiments are performed using extracts prepared from the Tetrahymena rseB cell line, we find that the SerH3 mRNA is only stable in extract prepared from cells grown under conditions in which the mRNA accumulates to detectable levels in the cytoplasm. These results indicate that the product of the rseB locus is a trans-acting cytoplasmic factor that exerts its effect on SerH3 gene expression by regulating SerH3 mRNA stability.

The SerH locus of Tetrahymena thermophila is one of several paralogous loci with genes encoding variants of the major cell surface protein known as the immobilization antigen (i-ag). The locus is highly polymorphic, raising questions concerning functional equivalency and selective forces acting on its multiple alleles. Here, we compare the sequences and expression of SerH1, SerH3, SerH4, SerH5, and SerH6. The precursor i-ags are highly similar. They are rich in alanine, serine, threonine, and cysteine and they share nearly identical ER translocation and GPI addition signals. The locations of the 39 cysteines are highly conserved, particularly in the 3.5 central, imperfect tandem repeats in which 8 periodic cysteines punctuate alternating short and long stretches of amino acids. Hydrophobicity patterns are also conserved. Nevertheless, amino acid sequence identity is low, ranging from 60.7 to 82.9%. At the nucleotide level, from 9.7 to 26.7% of nucleotide sites are polymorphic in pairwise comparisons. Expression of each allele is regulated by temperature-sensitive mRNA stability. H mRNAs are stable at <36 degrees but are unstable at >36 degrees. The H5 mRNA, which is less affected by temperature, has a different arrangement of the putative mRNA destabilization motif AUUUA. Statistical analysis of SerH genes indicates that the multiple alleles are neutral. Significantly low ratios of the rates of nonsynonymous to synonymous amino acid substitutions suggest that the multiple alleles are subject to purifying (negative) selection enforcing constraints on structure.

The expression of Tetrahymena surface proteins serotype H3 (SerH3) and serotype T (SerT) is under environmental regulation. SerH3 is expressed when cells are incubated between the temperatures of 20 and 35 degrees C, while SerT is expressed when cells are grown at temperatures above 35 degrees C. Using a SerH3 cDNA clone as a hybridization probe, we determined that (i) the SerH3 gene is a member of a multigene family; (ii) most members of this multigene family are variably rearranged during macronuclear development; and (iii) the gene which produces the SerH3 mRNA is reproducibly rearranged during macronuclear development.

In ciliates, only one of the alternative forms of the immunodominant membrane glycoprotein usually coats the external surface of the cell. Such mutual exclusion is regulated at the pretranslational level by mechanisms that result in the expression of a single protein gene. In the holotrich Tetrahymena thermophila five alternative cell surface immobilization proteins (i-antigens) are expressed under different conditions of temperature (L, H, T) and culture media (I, S). Using polyclonal and monoclonal antibodies to these proteins and a cDNA probe derived from the SerH3 gene, we have reinvestigated expression of i-antigens in media supplemented with 0.2 M NaCl. We find that in addition to S, the H and L antigens are also present on the cell surface. While all three i-antigens may be simultaneously present on the cell surface, the combinations S/L and S/H are more frequent. Compared to cells expressing H and L singly, the level of H3 mRNA is diminished, and a subset of the L family of polypeptides is variably expressed. The expression of S begins within 30 min after transfer to NaCl-supplemented medium, while the expression of L begins three days to several weeks after transfer. When cells are transferred out of NaCl-supplemented medium, S is turned off within 24 h, and L is expressed for at least 1 wk prior to the return of full H expression. Although these differences in kinetics suggest differences in control mechanism(s), the absence of I and T on the surface of NaCl-grown cells suggests that there is also a common regulatory link among H, S and L.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)

Synthesis of the serotype H3 (SerH3) surface antigen is temperature dependent and responds within 1 h to a change in incubation conditions (G.A. Bannon, R. Perkins-Dameron, and A. Allen-Nash, Mol. Cell. Biol. 6:3240-3245, 1986). Recently, a Tetrahymena thermophila cDNA clone (pC6; D.W. Martindale and P.J. Bruns, Mol. Cell. Biol. 3:1857-1865, 1983) has been shown to be homologous to a portion of the SerH3 mRNA (F.P. Doerder and R.L. Hallberg, personal communication), and it was shown that the cellular levels of this RNA rapidly decreased when cells were shifted from 30 to 41 degrees C (R.L. Hallberg, K.W. Kraus, and R.C. Findly, Mol. Cell. Biol. 4:2170-2179, 1984). These observations indicate that synthesis of the SerH3 protein is highly regulated in response to temperature and led us to initiate studies to determine the mechanism(s) by which SerH3 gene expression is controlled. Using pC6 as a hybridization probe for the SerH3 mRNA, we have determined that (i) the level of SerH3 protein synthesis is directly correlated with the amount of SerH3 message available for translation; (ii) there is, at most, a twofold difference between the relative transcription rates of SerH3 genes at 30 and 40 degrees C; (iii) the SerH3 mRNA half-life in cells incubated at 30 degrees C is greater than 1 h, whereas the half-life in cells incubated at 40 degrees C is only approximately 3 min. These results demonstrate that Tetrahymena SerH3 surface protein expression is regulated by mRNA abundance. Furthermore, the major mechanism controlling mRNA abundance is a dramatic temperature-dependent change in SerH3 mRNA stability.

In Tetrahymena thermophila, the expression of the temperature-specific surface protein SerH3 is controlled primarily by a temperature-dependent change in the stability of its mRNA. The change in SerH3 mRNA stability occurs very rapidly after a shift in incubation temperature. This change in temperature could affect SerH3 mRNA stability directly by producing structural changes in the mRNA or regulatory factors acting on SerH3 mRNA. Alternatively, the temperature change could act indirectly through a signal transduction pathway leading to de novo synthesis of new regulatory factors or modifications of existing regulatory factors. To address these issues, we monitored the effect of temperature on an in vitro SerH3 mRNA decay assay and the in vivo effects of a variety of inhibitors against protein synthesis and protein kinases on SerH3 mRNA stability. The results of Northern analysis of SerH3 mRNAs in an in vitro mRNA decay assay indicate that temperature alone can not change the half-life of this mRNA. Furthermore, slot blot analysis of cytoplasmic RNAs show that protein synthesis and the action of protein kinases are not required for SerH3 mRNA turnover in cells grown at 30 degrees C. In contrast, our results indicate that the rapid decay of the SerH3 mRNA in cells grown at 30 degrees C and shifted to 40 degrees C requires a one time serine/threonine phosphorylation event which occurs at the temperature shift. In addition, the data show that a regulatory protein involved in rapid SerH3 mRNA decay must be newly and continuously synthesized following the temperature shift from 30 to 40 degrees C. These data show the complexity of temperature regulated mRNA decay and indicate that phosphorylation and protein synthesis are major factors in this process.
