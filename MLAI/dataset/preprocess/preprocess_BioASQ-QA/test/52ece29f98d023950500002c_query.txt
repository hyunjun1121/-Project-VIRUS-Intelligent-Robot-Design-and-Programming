Which thyroid hormone transporter is implicated in thyroid hormone resistance syndrome?

[PMID: 21874823]
Laboratory findings can definitely help the patients not to enter into status, where the damage might be happen due to a miss-diagnosis based on clinical assessment alone. The secondary disease accompanied with thyroid patients should also carefully check out due to the interference which some diseases can cause in the amount of serum thyroid hormone, particularly the free thyroxin. The dilemma over thyroid clinical diagnosis occur due to variation on serum thyroid hormone which initiated by other non-thyroidal disorders which can play an important roles in metabolic disorders of thyroid hormone due to the alteration which occur on the serum level of thyroid hormone transporter proteins. The majority of serum thyroid hormones of up to 95-99% are bound to the carrier proteins mainly to Thyroxin-Binding Globulins (TBG), some transthyretin already known as pre-albumin and albumin which are all synthesis in the liver and any modification which alter their production may alter the status of thyroid hormones. It seems TBG, transthyretin and albumin carries 75, 20, 5% of thyroid hormones within blood circulation, respectively. The dilemma facing the thyroid hormones following disruption of thyroid hormone transporter protein synthesis originate from this fact that any alteration of these protein contribute to the alteration of total thyroid and free serum thyroid hormones which are in fact the biologically active form of thyroid hormones. The subsequent of latter implication result in miss-understanding and miss-diagnosis of thyroid function tests, with possible wrongly thyroid clinical care, followed by undesired therapy of otherwise healthy thyroid.

Resistance to thyroid hormone (RTH) is a rare autosomal dominant inherited syndrome of reduced end-organ responsiveness to thyroid hormone. Patients with RTH have elevated serum free thyroxine (FT4) and free triiodothyronine (FT3) concentrations and normal or slightly elevated serum thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH) level. Despite a variable clinical presentation, the common characteristic clinical features are goitre but an absence of the usual symptoms and metabolic consequences of thyroid hormone excess. Patients with RTH can be classified on clinical grounds alone into either generalized resistance (GRTH), pituitary resistance (PRTH) or combined. Mutations in the thyroid hormone receptor (TR) beta gene are responsible for RTH and 122 different mutations have now been identified belonging to 300 families. With the exception of one family found to have complete deletion of the TRbeta gene, all others have been demonstrated to have minor alterations at the DNA level. The differential diagnosis includes a TSH-secreting pituitary adenoma and the presence of endogenous antibodies directed against thyroxine (T4) and triiodothyronine (T3). Failure to differentiate RTH from primary thyrotoxicosis has resulted in the inappropriate treatment of nearly one-third of patients. Although occasionally desirable, no specific treatment is available for RTH; however, the diagnosis allows appropriate genetic counselling.

Six known steps are required for the circulating thyroid hormone (TH) to exert its action on target tissues. For three of these steps, human mutations and distinct phenotypes have been identified. The clinical, laboratory, genetic and molecular characteristics of these three defects of TH action are the subject of this review. The first defect, recognized 45years ago, produces resistance to TH and carries the acronym, RTH. In the majority of cases it is caused by TH receptor β gene mutations. It has been found in over 3000 individuals belonging to approximately 1000 families. Two relatively novel syndromes presenting reduced sensitivity to TH involve membrane transport and metabolism of TH. One of them, caused by mutations in the TH cell-membrane transporter MCT8, produces severe psychomotor defects. It has been identified in more than 170 males from 90 families. A defect of the intracellular metabolism of TH in 10 individuals from 8 families is caused by mutations in the SECISBP2 gene required for the synthesis of selenoproteins, including TH deiodinases. Defects at different steps along the pathway leading to TH action at cellular level can manifest as reduced sensitivity to TH. Knowledge of the molecular mechanisms involved in TH action allows the recognition of the phenotypes caused by defects of TH action. Once previously known defects have been ruled out, new molecular defects could be sought, thus opening the avenue for novel insights in thyroid physiology. This article is part of a Special Issue entitled Thyroid hormone signaling.

Thyroid hormone resistance syndromes are a group of genetic conditions characterized by decreased tissue sensitivity to thyroid hormones. Three syndromes, in which resistance to hormone action is respectively due to mutations in the gene encoding for thyroid hormone receptor TRβ, impaired T4 and T3 transport, and impaired conversion of T4 to T3 mediated by deiodinases. An updated review of each of these forms of resistance is provided, and their pathogenetic mechanisms and clinical approaches are discussed.

Generalized resistance to thyroid hormone (GRTH), a syndrome of inherited tissue hyposensitivity to thyroid hormone, is linked to thyroid hormone receptor (TR) mutations. A typical feature of GRTH is variable severity of organ involvement among families that, surprisingly, does not correlate with the degree of T3-binding impairment of the corresponding in vitro synthesized mutant TRs. Furthermore, variations in the clinical severity among family members harboring identical TR beta mutations have been reported. We compared serum levels of thyroid hormones that maintained a normal TSH in members of a large family with GRTH divided in three groups: Group A, 8 affected subjects with a mutation replacing arginine-320 with a histidine in the T3-binding domain of TR beta; Group B, 11 first degree relatives (sibs and children of affected subjects) with no TR beta mutation; Group C, 16 controls related by marriage. TSH values were not different among the three groups. As expected, total and free T4 and T3, and rT3 levels were significantly higher in Group A vs Groups B and C. However, with the exception of T3, the same tests were also significantly higher in Group B vs Group C. The latter differences are not due to thyroid hormone transport in serum since TBG concentrations were not different. It is postulated that genetic variability of factors that contribute to the action of thyroid hormone modulate the phenotype of GRTH associated with TR beta mutations.

At least six major steps are required for secreted thyroid hormone (TH) to exert its action on target tissues. Mutations interfering with three of these steps have been so far identified. The first recognized defect, which causes resistance to TH, involves the TH receptor beta gene and has been given the acronym RTH. Occurring in approximately 1 per 40,000 newborns, more than 1000 affected subjects, from 339 families, have been identified. The gene defect remains unknown in 15% of subjects with RTH. Two novel syndromes causing reduced sensitivity to TH were recently identified. One, producing severe psychomotor defects in > 100 males from 26 families, is caused by mutations in the cell-membrane transporter of TH, MCT8; the second, affecting the intracellular metabolism of TH in four individuals from two families, is caused by mutations in the SECISBP2 gene, which is required for the synthesis of selenoproteins, including TH deiodinases.

Resistance to thyroid hormone (RTH) is usually dominantly inherited and is characterized by elevated free thyroid hormones in the serum and failure to suppress pituitary thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH) secretion with variable refractoriness to hormone action in peripheral tissues. Two major forms of the disorder are recognized: asymptomatic individuals with generalized resistance (GRTH) and patients with thyrotoxic features, suggesting predominant pituitary resistance (PRTH). Molecular genetic analyses indicate that both GRTH and PRTH are associated with diverse mutations in the thyroid hormone receptor beta gene, which localize to three regions in the hormone binding domain of the receptor. In addition to being functionally impaired, the mutant receptors are also able to inhibit their wild-type counterparts in a dominant negative manner. Recognized features of RTH include failure to thrive, growth retardation and attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder in childhood, and goitre and thyrotoxic cardiac symptoms in adults. The pathogenesis of variable tissue resistance is not fully understood but may be related to the differing tissue distributions of a and b thyroid hormone receptors and variable dominant negative activity of mutant receptors on different target genes.

Mutations of the monocarboxylate transporter 8 (MCT8) gene determine a distinct X-linked phenotype of severe psychomotor retardation and consistently elevated T(3) levels. Lack of MCT8 transport of T(3) in neurons could explain the neurological phenotype. Our objective was to determine whether the high T(3) levels could also contribute to some critical features observed in these patients. A 16-yr-old boy with severe psychomotor retardation and hypotonia was hospitalized for malnutrition (body weight = 25 kg) and delayed puberty. He had tachycardia (104 beats/min), high SHBG level (261 nmol/liter), and elevated serum free T(3) (FT(3)) level (11.3 pmol/liter), without FT(4) and TSH abnormalities. A missense mutation of the MCT8 gene was present. Oral overfeeding was unsuccessful. The therapeutic effect of propylthiouracil (PTU) and then PTU plus levothyroxine (LT(4)) was tested. After PTU (200 mg/d), serum FT(4) was undetectable, FT(3) was reduced (3.1 pmol/liter) with high TSH levels (50.1 mU/liter). Serum SHBG levels were reduced (72 nmol/liter). While PTU prescription was continued, high LT(4) doses (100 microg/d) were needed to normalize serum TSH levels (3.18 mU/liter). At that time, serum FT(4) was normal (16.4 pmol/liter), and FT(3) was slightly high (6.6 pmol/liter). Tachycardia was abated (84 beats/min), weight gain was 3 kg in 1 yr, and SHBG was 102 nmol/liter. 1) When thyroid hormone production was reduced by PTU, high doses of LT(4) (3.7 microg/kg.d) were needed to normalize serum TSH, confirming that mutation of MCT8 is a cause of resistance to thyroid hormone. 2) High T(3) levels might exhibit some deleterious effects on adipose, hepatic, and cardiac levels. 3) PTU plus LT(4) could be an effective therapy to reduce general adverse features, unfortunately without benefit on the psychomotor retardation.

Thyroid hormone is a pleiotropic hormone with widespread biological actions. For instance, adequate levels of thyroid hormone are critical for the development of different tissues such as the central nervous system, but are also essential for the regulation of metabolic processes throughout life. The biological activity of thyroid hormone depends not only on serum thyroid hormone levels, but is also regulated at the tissue level by the expression and activity of deiodinases, which activate thyroid hormone or mediate its degradation. In addition, thyroid hormone transporters are necessary for the uptake of thyroid hormone into target tissues. With the discovery of monocarboxylate transporter 8 (MCT8) as a specific thyroid hormone transporter and the finding that mutations in this transporter lead to a syndrome of severe psychomotor retardation and elevated serum 3,3',5-tri-iodothyronine levels known as the Allan-Herndon-Dudley syndrome, the interest in this area of research has greatly increased. In this review, we will focus on the molecular aspects of thyroid hormone transporters, including MCT8, MCT10, organic anion transporting polypeptides, and the effects of genetic variation in these transporters.

To discuss the recent advances on thyroid hormone transport in the brain. A special attention is paid to the X-linked thyroid hormone cell transport (THCT) defect (also known as the Allan-Herndon-Dudley syndrome), caused by mutations of the specific thyroid hormone transporter MCT8 gene. MCT8 is involved in thyroid hormone transport in the brain. MRI of patients with THCT defect showed myelination delays, probably related to impaired thyroid hormone action on oligodendrocytes. MCT8 is also expressed in the thyroid and has an important role in thyroid hormone secretion. The altered circulating concentrations of thyroid hormone in the patients are partly because of impaired secretion and altered peripheral metabolism. Increased deiodinase activity is important in the pathophysiology of the syndrome. High D1 activity in liver and kidney increases T4 and rT3 deiodination, and contributes to the increased serum T3. High D2 activity in the brain contributes to compensate the deficient T3 transport by increasing local T3 production. Patients with suspected X-linked leukoencephalopathy should be screened for MCT8 gene mutations. Research on the brain pathophysiology of the THCT defect should focus on the specific role of Mct8 on oligodendrocytes and myelination.

Resistance to thyroid hormone (RTH) is a syndrome in which patients have raised serum thyroid hormone (TH) levels and raised or inappropriately normal thyrotropin (TSH) levels. In general, patients exhibit TH resistance in the pituitary and peripheral tissues. Novel techniques and genetically engineered mouse model systems have increased our understanding of thyroid hormone receptor (TR) action, and shed new light on the underlying molecular mechanisms for RTH. In particular, we are learning how mutant TRs from RTH patients can block wild-type TR function, with consequent effects in various tissues and cells. This dominant-negative activity has important implications for other hormone-resistant conditions and in hormone-sensitive tumors. This article examines the molecular basis of RTH.

In in vitro experiments, active transport of thyroid hormones had been repeatedly demonstrated. The membrane transporters for thyroid hormones which have been identified include the organic anion transporting polypeptide, heterodimeric amino acid transporters and the monocarboxylate transporters (MCT) which are the focus of this chapter. The gene encoding MCT8 which was identified as a specific thyroid hormone transporter is located on chromosome Xq13.2. The expression pattern of MCT8 indicates that MCT8 plays an important role in the development of the central nervous system by transporting thyroid hormone into neurons as its main target cells. Mutational analysis of the MCT8 gene revealed mutations or deletions in the MCT8 gene in unrelated male patients with severe psychomotor retardation and biochemical findings consistent with thyroid hormone resistance. Indeed, thyroid function tests in patients with MCT8 mutations demonstrated marked elevations of serum T3 (in the thyrotoxic range), a significant decrease in serum T4 or fT4 and normal to elevated TSH levels.

The finding of increased thyroxine (T4) and tri-iodothyronine (T3) levels in a patient with normal or increased thyroid-stimulating hormone is unexpected and presents a differential diagnosis between a thyroid-stimulating hormone-secreting pituitary adenoma, generalized resistance to thyroid hormone (RTH) and laboratory artefact. Without careful clinical and biochemical evaluation, errors may occur in patient diagnosis and treatment. In the case of RTH, mutation of the thyroid hormone receptor beta gene results in generalized tissue resistance to thyroid hormone. As the pituitary gland shares in this tissue resistance, euthyroidism with a normal thyroid-stimulating hormone is usually maintained by increased thyroid hormones. To date, we have identified eight pedigrees in New Zealand with mutations in the thyroid hormone receptor beta gene, including two novel mutations. Mutational analysis of the thyroid hormone receptor beta gene allows definitive diagnosis of RTH, potentially avoiding the need for protracted and expensive pituitary function testing and imaging. Mutational analysis also enables family screening and may help to avoid potential misdiagnosis and inappropriate treatment.

Variations in major thyroid hormone transport proteins may be inherited or acquired and may be associated with changes in serum concentration of the proteins or their affinity for thyroid hormones. These variations most frequently involve thyroxine-binding globulin (TBG), but changes in transthyretin and albumin are also observed. The consequent alteration of thyroid hormone-binding capacity in serum is associated with variations in total thyroid hormone concentration. Increased serum total thyroid hormone levels are found in subjects with TBG excess, familial dysalbuminemic hyperthyroxinemia, and transthyretin-associated hyperthyroxinemia. Conversely, diminished serum thyroid hormone values are observed in subjects with TBG deficiency, and decreased concentration or affinity of transthyretin and albumin is not associated with variations in serum concentrations of thyroid hormones. The transport protein-associated variations in serum total thyroid hormone concentrations do not reflect a change in thyroid status. Euthyroidism can be easily established in subjects with transport protein abnormalities by the normal free thyroid hormone and TSH concentrations. It is, however, crucial to select methods for free thyroid hormone measurement that are not affected by abnormalities of transport proteins. Some assays, such as the analog method, often provide artifactual and misleading results, which may lead to inappropriate and even detrimental treatments. The evolutionary advantage of TBG (and albumin) in terms of thyroid homeostasis still remains to be elucidated.

Thyroid hormone receptors (T3Rs) both repress and activate gene transcription by interacting with auxiliary factors denoted corepressors and coactivators. Resistance to thyroid hormone (RTH) syndrome in humans is manifested as a failure to respond properly to elevated circulating thyroid hormone. RTH syndrome has been mapped to T3Rbeta mutations that alter the transcriptional properties of the receptor, resulting in a dominant negative phenotype. We report here a characterization of a series of RTH mutant T3Rs that exhibit unusual interactions with corepressor. Two mutations in receptor helix 11 (delta430, delta432) greatly enhance the ability of the mutant receptors to bind to corepressor. A distinct mutation, V264D, in an 'omega loop' region of the receptor, impairs corepressor release but does not fully eliminate the ability to recruit coactivator. These mutations reveal novel determinants that regulate the interaction of the T3R with important ancillary cofactors, and that are disrupted in a human endocrine disease.

Allan-Herndon-Dudley Syndrome (AHDS), an X linked condition, is characterized by congenital hypotonia that progresses to spasticity with severe psychomotor delays, in combination with altered thyroid hormone levels, in particular, high serum T3 levels. Recently, this disease was proved to be caused by mutations in SLC16A2 coding for the monocarboxylate thyroid hormone transporter 8 (MCT8). Here we describe a 26-year -old Japanese patient with AHDS who had deletion of exon 3 of SLC16A2.

Although rare, thyroid hormone resistance syndrome should be suspected on a biological profile combining high thyroid hormone and non-suppressed TSH plasma levels. Resistance to thyroid hormone can be classified into 3 forms: generalized, pituitary and peripheral, all three showing tissue resistance heterogeneity from one person to another, and from one tissue to another in the same subject. In the generalized and pituitary forms, thyroid hormone levels are high with paradoxically normal or increased TSH levels. The TRH test still stimulates TSH secretion, and only the highest doses of T3 successfully suppress TSH secretion. In the generalized form, euthyroidism is usual, whereas in the pituitary form hyperthyroidism requires treatment in order to lower TSH secretion. In the peripheral form, various symptoms of thyroid hormone deficiency may be observed, contrasting with normal T3, T4 and TSH serum levels, and requiring supraphysiological doses of T3 for correction. In most cases, familial occurrence can be evidenced, with an autosomal dominant or sometimes recessive mode of inheritance. Genetic analysis has identified, in the generalized form, more than 10 mutations of the thyroid hormone receptor beta gene, all resulting in an alteration in the T3 binding domain of the receptor. In the autosomal dominant form, tissue resistance may result from a "dominant inhibitory effect" of the normal receptor function by the mutant receptor. All these thyroid hormone resistance syndromes constitute exceptional models for studying the mechanisms of action of thyroid hormones. Simultaneous observations of the mutated receptors with various clinical and biological phenotypes should further our understanding of thyroid hormone receptor function.

Forty years have elapsed since the first description of a syndrome of resistance in the hypothalamic-pituitary-thyroid axis, i.e., resistance to thyroid hormone action. In the last two decades many other types of resistance have been discovered, including resistance to the action of thyrotropin-releasing hormone (TRH), of thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH), and of thyroid hormones (THs); the latter can be due not only to thyroid hormone receptor defects but also to alteration in genes encoding TH-specific transporters or components involved in metabolic pathways of THs. Moreover, alteration in genes encoding for second messengers may cause forms of resistance other than those due to receptor mutations, the most important one being that of an inactivating mutation in the G-protein alpha-subunit leading to TSH resistance in the setting of pseudohypoparathyroidism type 1a. Recognition of these rare thyroid disorders is of great importance not only for informed genetic counselling but also for avoiding diagnostic mistakes that may lead to incorrect and potentially dangerous treatments.

Nuclear hormone receptors are hormone-regulated transcription factors that play critical roles in chordate development and homeostasis. Aberrant nuclear hormone receptors have been implicated as causal agents in a number of endocrine and neoplastic diseases. The syndrome of Resistance to Thyroid Hormone (RTH) is a human genetic disease characterized by an impaired physiological response to thyroid hormone. RTH is associated with diverse mutations in the thyroid hormone receptor beta-gene. The resulting mutant receptors function as dominant negatives, interfering with the actions of normal thyroid hormone receptors coexpressed in the same cells. We report here that RTH receptors interact aberrantly with a newly recognized family of transcriptional corepressors variously denoted as nuclear receptor corepressor (N-CoR), retinoid X receptor interacting protein-13 (RIP-13), silencing mediator for retinoid and thyroid hormone receptors (SMRT), and thyroid hormone receptor-associating cofactor (TRAC). All RTH receptors tested exhibit an impaired ability to dissociate from corepressors in the presence of thyroid hormone. Two of the RTH mutations uncouple corepressor dissociation from hormone binding; two additional RTH mutants exhibit an unusually strong interaction with corepressor under all hormone conditions tested. Finally, artificial mutants that abolish corepressor binding abrogate the dominant negative activity of RTH mutants. We suggest that an altered corepressor interaction is likely to play a critical role in the dominant negative potency of RTH mutants and may contribute to the variable phenotype in this disorder.

Thyroid hormones (T3, T4) exert multiple cellular effects through nuclear thyroid hormone receptors (TR alpha, TR beta). Thyroid hormone receptors are transcription factors that act by altering patterns of gene expression. Resistance to thyroid hormone (RTH) is a rare disorder caused by mutations in the TR beta gene. Biochemically, the syndrome is defined by elevated circulating levels of free thyroid hormones due to reduced target tissue responsiveness and normal, or elevated, levels of thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH). This "inappropriate" TSH elevation contrasts with the situation in hyperthyroidism, where the pituitary secretion of TSH is suppressed. Patients with RTH usually present with goiter and an euthyroid or mildly hypothyroid metabolic state. Thus, pituitary resistance results in hypersecretion of TSH, which compensates, at least in part, for hormone resistance in peripheral tissues. Despite this compensation, clinical effects of RTH can include short stature, delayed bone maturation, hyperactivity, learning disabilities, and hearing defects, as well as variable features of hyper- and hypothyroidism. With the exception of a single sibship, which harbored a deletion of the entire coding sequence of the TR beta gene and a recessive pattern of inheritance, all other cases of RTH have been inherited in an autosomal dominant manner or have been de novo heterozygous mutations of the TR beta gene. The dominant pattern of inheritance is explained by the functional properties of the mutant receptors which act in a dominant negative manner to block the activity of normal TR alpha and TR beta receptors. Now that a large number of different RTH mutations have been identified, it is striking that the mutations are clustered within restricted domains in the carboxyterminal region of the receptor. Mutations in these regions have been shown to preserve critical receptor functions such as dimerization and DNA binding, while inactivating other activites such as T3 binding and transcriptional activation. The examination of patients with RTH and their mutated receptors has provided important insights into the mechanisms of thyroid hormone action, the structure-function relationship of the receptors, and the molecular mechanisms of dominant negative activity.

The thyroid hormone resistance syndromes are disorders in which the body's tissues are resistant to the effects of thyroid hormone. Generalized resistance to thyroid hormone (GRTH) is characterized by resistance in the pituitary gland and in most or all of the peripheral tissues. Affected individuals have elevated serum thyroid hormone levels and inappropriately normal or elevated thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) but are usually clinically euthyroid and require no treatment. Selective pituitary resistance to thyroid hormone (PRTH) is characterized by resistance in the pituitary gland but not in peripheral tissues. Patients have elevated serum thyroid hormone levels and normal or elevated TSH levels and are clinically thyrotoxic. Therapy is usually necessary, but current choices are not completely satisfactory. Selective peripheral resistance to thyroid hormone (PerRTH) is characterized by resistance in peripheral tissues but not in the pituitary. The only patient thus far described had normal serum thyroid hormone and TSH levels but was clinically hypothyroid and improved with thyroid hormone administration. All of these disorders are probably more common than is generally recognized and are often misdiagnosed and inappropriately treated. GRTH, in most cases studied, results from a mutation in the thyroid hormone receptor beta gene causing an amino acid substitution in or a partial or complete deletion of the thyroid hormone-binding domain of the receptor. The causes of PRTH and PerRTH remain to be determined.

Resistance to thyroid hormone (RTH) is an inherited syndrome characterized by reduced tissue responsiveness to thyroid hormone. Subjects have elevated serum thyroid hormone levels in association with a nonsuppressed TSH. Goiter and thyroid test abnormalities have most often led to further investigation, underscoring the paucity of specific clinical manifestations of RTH. Hypothyroidism has been considered when growth or mental retardation was the presenting symptom and thyrotoxicosis when dealing with attention deficit or hyperactivity. Failure to recognize the inappropriate persistence of TSH secretion, in spite of elevated thyroid hormone levels, has commonly resulted in erroneous diagnosis leading to treatment aimed to normalize the thyroid hormone level. More than 400 subjects with this syndrome have been identified. The mode of inheritance appears to be autosomal dominant in the majority of families. It has long been suspected that RTH is most likely caused by an abnormal thyroid hormone receptor (TR), but this hypothesis could not be directly tested until the isolation of two TR genes, TR alpha and TR beta, located in chromosomes 17 and 3, respectively. TR beta gene mutations have been recently identified in 68 families with RTH. All mutations are located in the T3-binding domain, straddling the putative TR-dimerization region. Mutant TRs exhibit hormone-binding impairment, the degree of which does not correlate with the severity of clinical manifestations. This finding, and the fact that heterozygous subjects with complete TR deletion are not affected, while those with point mutations are, indicated that interactions of the mutant TRs with normal TRs and with other factors, are responsible for the dominant inheritance of RTH and its clinical heterogeneity.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)

Cellular entry is an important step preceding intracellular metabolism and action of thyroid hormone (TH). Transport of TH across the plasma membrane does not take place by simple diffusion but requires transporter proteins. One of the most effective and specific TH transporters identified to date is monocarboxylate transporter 8 (MCT8), the gene of which is located on the X chromosome. Although MCT8 is expressed in many tissues, its function appears to be most critical in the brain. Hemizygous MCT8 mutations in males cause severe psychomotor retardation, known as the Allan-Herndon-Dudley syndrome (AHDS), and abnormal serum TH levels. AHDS thus represents a type of TH resistance caused by a defect in cellular TH transport.

MCT8 is a cellular transporter of thyroid hormones important in their action and metabolization. We report a male patient with the novel inactivating mutation 630insG in the coding region in exon 1 of MCT8. He was characterized clinically by severe neurologic impairment (initially with global hypotonia, later evolving with generalized hypertonia), normal growth during infancy, reduced weight gain, and absence of typical signs and symptoms of hypothyroidism, while the laboratory evaluation disclosed elevated T3, low total and free T4, and mildly elevated TSH serum levels. Treatment with levothyroxine improved thyroid hormone profile but was not able to alter the clinical picture of the patient. These data reinforce the concept that the role of MCT8 is tissue-dependent: while neurons are highly dependent on MCT8, bone tissue, adipose tissue, muscle, and liver are less dependent on MCT8 and, therefore, may suffer the consequences of the exposition to high serum T3 levels.

Thyroid hormone resistance (THR) is a rare syndrome of reduced end organ sensitivity. Patients with THR have elevated serum free thyroxine (FT4), free triiodothyronine (FT3), but normal or slightly elevated serum thyrotropin values. The characteristic clinical feature is goitre without symptoms and metabolic consequences of thyroid hormone excess. THR can be classified on the basis of tissue resistance into pituitary, peripheral or generalised (both pituitary and peripheral) types. Mutations in the TRbeta gene, cell membrane transporter and genes controlling intracellular metabolism of thyroid hormone have been implicated. THR is differentiated from thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH) secreting pituitary adenoma by history of THR in the family. No specific treatment is often required for THR; patients with features of hypo- or hyperthyroidism are appropriately treated with levo-triiodothyronine (L-T3), levo-thyroxine (L-T4), dextro-thyroxine(D-T4) or 3,3,5 triiodo-thyroacetic acid (TRIAC). The diagnosis helps in appropriate genetic counselling of the family.

Known since 1967 and usually familial, the syndrome of tissue resistance to thyroid hormones may take one of two different forms, depending on the receptors involved. When resistance affects both peripheral and pituitary receptors, plasma thyroid hormone levels are high despite the lack of thyrotoxicosis, thyroxine and triiodothyronine are ineffective, even in high dosage, and plasma TSH increases to explode under TRH. When resistance only affects pituitary receptors, there is moderate thyrotoxicosis with paradoxical and inappropriate TSH increase. Contrary to expectations, nuclear receptors to triiodothyronine are perturbed in only a few cases. Reduction of thyrotropic hyperfunction, which is the primary purpose of treatment, can be achieved with D-forms of thyroid hormones or with somatostatin and its derivatives.

Generalized resistance to thyroid hormone (GRTH) encompasses a heterogeneous group of conditions characterized by reduced responses of target tissues to thyroid hormone due to defects at the site of hormone action. In the majority of patients, GRTH is inherited as a dominant trait associated with mutations in the hormone-binding domain of the thyroid hormone receptor. GRTH serves as a prototype of other resistance syndromes for hormones that act via nuclear receptors.
