Sirtuins and their pharmacological activators/inhibitors have been associated with a range of neuroprotective effects or disease modifying influences in neurological disorders. Huntington's disease (HD) is an autosomal-dominant, progressive neurodegenerative disease characterized by movement disorder, psychiatric symptoms and cognitive decline. The monogenic mutation in HD encodes a variant of the protein Huntingtin (HTT). The disease is a consequence of a CAG repeat extension leading to an abnormally long polyglutamine (Q) stretch at HTT's N-terminus, which likely confers a toxic gain of function to the mutant polypeptide. HD has currently no effective disease-modifying therapy or preventive measures. In the past 2decades, a sizable body of work on Sirtuins' modification of HD pathology using HD cell and animal models has accumulated. In this chapter, evidence for Sirtuin activities as potential modifiers of HD pathology is reviewed. The conflicting findings of the impacts of mammalian Sirtuin paralogs on HD pathogenesis and disease progression are highlighted. The possible cellular and molecular mechanisms underlying Sirtuin activities in HD are discussed with reference to pathophysiological mechanisms of transcription perturbation, proteostasis, mitochondrial function, and microtubule dynamics. A brief therapeutic perspective on the use of Sirtuin activators and inhibitors is also presented.

Dysfunctions in brain cholesterol homeostasis have been extensively related to brain disorders. The main pathway for brain cholesterol elimination is its hydroxylation into 24S-hydroxycholesterol by the cholesterol 24-hydrolase, CYP46A1. Increasing evidence suggests that CYP46A1 has a role in the pathogenesis and progression of neurodegenerative disorders, and that increasing its levels in the brain is neuroprotective. However, the mechanisms underlying this neuroprotection remain to be fully understood. Huntington's disease is a fatal autosomal dominant neurodegenerative disease caused by an abnormal CAG expansion in huntingtin's gene. Among the multiple cellular and molecular dysfunctions caused by this mutation, altered brain cholesterol homeostasis has been described in patients and animal models as a critical event in Huntington's disease. Here, we demonstrate that a gene therapy approach based on the delivery of CYP46A1, the rate-limiting enzyme for cholesterol degradation in the brain, has a long-lasting neuroprotective effect in Huntington's disease and counteracts multiple detrimental effects of the mutated huntingtin. In zQ175 Huntington's disease knock-in mice, CYP46A1 prevented neuronal dysfunctions and restored cholesterol homeostasis. These events were associated to a specific striatal transcriptomic signature that compensates for multiple mHTT-induced dysfunctions. We thus explored the mechanisms for these compensations and showed an improvement of synaptic activity and connectivity along with the stimulation of the proteasome and autophagy machineries, which participate to the clearance of mutant huntingtin (mHTT) aggregates. Furthermore, BDNF vesicle axonal transport and TrkB endosome trafficking were restored in a cellular model of Huntington's disease. These results highlight the large-scale beneficial effect of restoring cholesterol homeostasis in neurodegenerative diseases and give new opportunities for developing innovative disease-modifying strategies in Huntington's disease.

Careful comparison of symptomatic individuals with normal controls has revealed the primary biochemical abnormality in many human genetic diseases, particularly recessive disorders. This strategy has proved less successful for most human disorders which are not recessive, and where a single copy of the aberrant gene has clinically significant effects even though the normal gene product is present. An alternative approach that eliminates the impediment of a normal protein in affected individuals is to study homozygotes for the mutant allele. For virtually all dominant human disorders in which homozygotes have been described, symptoms have been significantly more severe in the homozygote than in the heterozygote. Thus, these disorders do not conform to the classical definition of dominance which states that homozygotes and heterozygotes for a defect are phenotypically indistinguishable. Instead, they display incomplete dominance, indicating that the normal allele may play a role in ameliorating the disease process. The D4S10 locus, defined by the probe G8 and linked to the gene for Huntington's disease (HD), has permitted us to identify individuals with a high probability of being homozygous for this autosomal dominant neurodegenerative disorder. These homozygotes do not differ in clinical expression or course from typical HD heterozygotes. HD appears to be the first human disease of genetically documented homozygosity that displays complete phenotypic dominance.

Huntington's disease is an autosomal dominant neurodegenerative disease caused by a toxic gain of function mutation in the huntingtin gene (Htt). Silencing of Htt with RNA interference using direct CNS delivery in rodent models of Huntington's disease has been shown to reduce pathology and promote neuronal recovery. A key translational step for this approach is extension to the larger non-human primate brain, achieving sufficient distribution of small interfering RNA targeting Htt (siHtt) and levels of Htt suppression that may have therapeutic benefit. We evaluated the potential for convection enhanced delivery (CED) of siHtt to provide widespread and robust suppression of Htt in nonhuman primates. siHtt was infused continuously for 7 or 28 days into the nonhuman primate putamen to analyze effects of infusion rate and drug concentration on the volume of effective suppression. Distribution of radiolabeled siHtt and Htt suppression were quantified by autoradiography and PCR, respectively, in tissue punches. Histopathology was evaluated and Htt suppression was also visualized in animals treated for 28 days. Seven days of CED led to widespread distribution of siHtt and significant Htt silencing throughout the nonhuman primate striatum in an infusion rate and dose dependent manner. Htt suppression at therapeutic dose levels was well tolerated by the brain. A model developed from these results predicts that continuous CED of siHtt can achieve significant coverage of the striatum of Huntington's disease patients. These findings suggest that this approach may provide an important therapeutic strategy for treating Huntington's disease.

Huntington disease is an autosomal-dominant neurodegenerative disease of mid-life onset caused by expansion of a polymorphic trinucleotide (CAG) repeat. Variable penetrance for alleles carrying 36-39 repeats has been noted, but the disease appears fully penetrant when the repeat numbers are >40. An abnormal CAG repeat may expand, contract, or be stably transmitted when passed from parent to child. Assays used to diagnose Huntington disease must be optimized to ensure the accurate and unambiguous quantitation of CAG repeat length. This document provides an overview of Huntington disease and methodological considerations for Huntington disease testing. Examples of laboratory reports are also included.

Huntington's disease (HD) is a genetically dominant neurodegenerative condition caused by an unique mutation in the disease gene huntingtin. Although the Huntington protein (Htt) is ubiquitously expressed, expansion of the polyglutamine tract in Htt leads to the progressive loss of specific neuronal subpopulations in HD brains. In this article, we will summarize the current understanding on mechanisms of how mutant Htt can elicit cytotoxicity, as well as how the selective sets of neuronal cell death occur in HD brains.

Huntington disease (HD) is a well-defined autosomal dominant neurodegenerative disease caused by CAG repeat expansions in HD gene. There are a significant number of HD cases where this mutation was not found and such cases are named HD-like phenotype (HDL). This article reports 48 patients with HDL phenotype. Patients were analyzed on the presence of mutations in prion (PrP), ferritin and junctophilin-3 (JP-3) genes. None of the patients showed the presence of the mutation in analyzed genes. This could suggest that there is some other gene/genes where the mutation can cause the disease with clinical features of HD.

Huntington's Disease (HD) is an autosomal dominant neurodegenerative disease characterized by gradual deterioration of motor and cognitive functions and development of psychiatric deficits. Animal models provide powerful means to study the pathological processes, molecular dysfunctions and symptoms associated with HD. We performed a longitudinal behavioral study of the newly developed HdhQ350/+ mouse line, a knock-in model that expresses a repeat of 350 glutamines. We found remarkable sex-dependent differences on symptom onset and severity. While both sexes lose weight and grip strength, only HdhQ350/+ males have impaired motor coordination as measured by the rotarod and alterations in gait as measured by the catwalk assay. While HdhQ350/+ females do not exhibit impairment in motor coordination, we found a reduction in dark phase locomotor activity. Male and female HdhQ350/+ mice do not show anxiety as measured by the elevated plus maze or changes in exploration as measured by the open field test. To investigate these sex-dependent differences, we performed western blot analyses of striatal tissue. We measured equal mutant huntingtin protein expression in both sexes and found evidence of aggregation. We found the expected decrease of DARPP-32 expression only in female HdhQ350/+ mice. Remarkably, we found no evidence of reduction in synaptophysin or CB<sub>1</sub> receptors in HdhQ350/+ tissue of either sex. Our study indicates that male and female HdhQ350/+ mice differentially recapitulate select behavioral impairments commonly measured in other HD mouse models with limited sex-dependent changes in recognized histopathological markers. We conclude that expanded polyglutamine repeats influence HD pathogenesis in a sex-dependent manner.

Accumulating evidence highlights the potential role of mixed proteinopathies (i.e., abnormal protein aggregation) in the development of clinical manifestations of neurodegenerative diseases (NDD). Huntington's disease (HD) is an inherited NDD caused by autosomal-dominant expanded CAG trinucleotide repeat mutation in the gene coding for Huntingtin (Htt). Previous studies have suggested the coexistence of phosphorylated-Tau, α-synuclein (α-Syn) and TAR DNA-binding protein 43 (TDP-43) inclusions in HD. However, definite evidence that HD pathology in humans can be accompanied by other proteinopathies is still lacking. Using human post-mortem putamen samples from 31 controls and 56 HD individuals, we performed biochemical analyses of the expression, oligomerization and aggregation of Tau, α-Syn, TDP-43, and Amyloid precursor protein (APP)/Aβ. In HD brain, we observed reduced soluble protein (but not mRNA) levels of Htt, α-Syn, and Tau. Our results also support abnormal phosphorylation of Tau in more advanced stages of disease. Aberrant splicing of Tau exons 2, 3 (exclusion) and 10 (inclusion) was also detected in HD patients, leading to higher 0N4R and lower 1N3R isoforms. Finally, following formic acid extraction, we observed increased aggregation of TDP-43, α-Syn, and phosphorylated-Tau during HD progression. Notably, we observed that 88% of HD patients with Vonsattel grade 4 neuropathology displayed at least one non-Htt proteinopathy compared to 29% in controls. Interestingly, α-Syn aggregation correlated with Htt, TDP-43 and phosphorylated-Tau in HD but not in controls. The impact of this work is twofold: (1) it provides compelling evidences that Tau, α-Syn and TDP-43 proteinopathies are increased in HD, and (2) it suggests the involvement of common mechanisms leading to abnormal accumulation of aggregation-prone proteins in NDD. Further studies will be needed to decipher the impact of these proteinopathies on clinical manifestation of HD.

Huntington's disease (HD) is a late onset, incurable, autosomal dominantly-inherited, progressive neuropsychiatric disease, characterised by chorea, changes in personality, mood and behaviour, and dementia. Huntington's disease is a clinical diagnosis. The advent of DNA diagnosis has made predictive, prenatal and preimplantation testing possible for at-risk persons or asymptomatic carriers. The prevalence is estimated to be 3-10/100,000 among individuals of European descent; HD is less common in other ethnic groups. Huntington's disease is caused by an expanded trinucleotide CAG repeat in the HD gene on chromosome 4. The gene encodes for the protein huntingtin, with an as yet unknown function. The mutated huntingtin has an elongated stretch of glutamines which leads to a gain of function such as overactivity, excitotoxicity, or to interactions with other proteins.
