Which gene has been found to be mutant in Lesch-Nyhan Disease patients?

[PMID: 8485579]
The inherited disease Lesch-Nyhan syndrome, which is caused by a deficiency of the enzyme hypoxanthine phosphoribosyltransferase (HPRT), is characterized by behavioural alterations, including self-injurious behaviour and mental retardation. Although HPRT-deficient mice have been generated using the embryonic stem cell system, no spontaneous behavioural abnormalities had been reported. We examined whether mice were more tolerant of HPRT deficiency because they were more reliant on adenine phosphoribosyltransferase (APRT) than HPRT for their purine salvage. The administration of an APRT inhibitor to HPRT-deficient mice induced persistent self-injurious behaviour. This combined genetic and biochemical model will facilitate the study of Lesch-Nyhan syndrome and the evaluation of novel therapies.

Lesch-Nyhan syndrome is caused by a deficiency of hypoxanthine phosphoribosyltransferase (HPRT) encoded by HPRT1. About 20% of patients have a deletion of HPRT1 and large deletions of HPRT1 are not always fully characterized at the molecular level. Here, we report on a case of Lesch-Nyhan syndrome with a 33-kb deletion involving exon 1 of HPRT1. This novel mutation is caused by a nonhomologous recombination between different classes of interspersed repetitive DNA.

Mutations in the gene encoding the purine biosynthetic enzyme hypoxanthine-guanine phosphoribosyltransferase (HPRT) cause the intractable neurodevelopmental Lesch-Nyhan disease (LND) associated with aberrant development of brain dopamine pathways. In the current study, we have identified an increased expression of the microRNA miR181a in HPRT-deficient human dopaminergic SH-SY5Y neuroblastoma cells. Among the genes potentially regulated by miR181a are several known to be required for neural development, including Engrailed1 (En1), Engrailed2 (En2), Lmx1a and Brn2. We demonstrate that these genes are down-regulated in HPRT-deficient SH-SY5Y cells and that over-expression of miR181a significantly reduces endogenous expression of these genes and inhibits translation of luciferase plasmids bearing the En1/2 or Lmx1a 3'UTR miRNA-binding elements. Conversely, inhibition of miR181a increases the expression of these genes and enhances translation of luciferase constructs bearing the En1/2 and Lmx1a 3'UTR miRNA-binding sequences. We also demonstrate that key neurodevelopmental genes (e.g. Nurr1, Pitx3, Wnt1 and Mash1) known to be functional partners of Lmx1a and Brn2 are also markedly down-regulated in SH-SY5Y cells over-expressing miR181a and in HPRT-deficient cells. Our findings in SH-SY5Y cells demonstrate that HPRT deficiency is accompanied by dysregulation of some of the important pathways that regulate the development of dopaminergic neurons and dopamine pathways and that this defect is associated with and possibly due at least partly to aberrant expression of miR181a. Because aberrant expression of miR181a is not as apparent in HPRT-deficient LND fibroblasts, the relevance of the SH-SY5Y neuroblastoma cells to human disease remains to be proven. Nevertheless, we propose that these pleiotropic neurodevelopment effects of miR181a may play a role in the pathogenesis of LND.

We have analysed adenosine transport and [3H] NBTI binding in peripheral blood lymphocytes obtained from Lesch-Nyhan patients, in basal conditions and following 24 h incubation with hypoxanthine. We found that adenosine transport and [3H] NBTI binding were significantly decreased in PBL-LN with respect to PBL-C in basal conditions. Following 25 microM hypoxanthine incubation, adenosine transport is decreased in PBL-LN with respect to basal transport, however, [3H] NBTI binding in PBL-LN was not decreased following hypoxanthine incubation.

Lesch-Nyhan Disease (LND) is the result of mutations in the X-linked gene encoding the purine metabolic enzyme, hypoxanthine guanine phosphoribosyl transferase (HPRT). LND gives rise to severe neurological anomalies including mental retardation, dystonia, chorea, pyramidal signs and a compulsive and aggressive behavior to self injure. The neurological phenotype in LND has been shown to reflect aberrant dopaminergic signaling in the basal ganglia, however there are little data correlating the defect in purine metabolism to the neural-related abnormalities. In the present studies, we find that HPRT-deficient neuronal cell lines have reduced CREB (cAMP response element-binding protein) expression and intracellular cyclic AMP (cAMP), which correlates with attenuated CREB-dependent transcriptional activity and a reduced phosphorylation of protein kinase A (PKA) substrates such as synapsin (p-syn I). Of interest, we found increased expression of phosphodiesterase 10A (PDE10A) in HPRT-deficient cell lines and that the PDE10 inhibitor papaverine and PDE10A siRNA restored cAMP/PKA signaling. Furthermore, reconstitution of HPRT expression in mutant cells partly increased cAMP signaling synapsin phosphorylation. In conclusion, our data show that HPRT-deficiency alters cAMP/PKA signaling pathway, which is in part due to the increased of PDE10A expression and activity. These findings suggest a mechanistic insight into the possible causes of LND and highlight PDE10A as a possible therapeutic target for this intractable neurological disease.

The study of Lesch-Nyhan-diseased (LND) human brain is crucial for understanding how mutant hypoxanthine-phosphoribosyltransferase (HPRT) might lead to neuronal dysfunction. Since LND is a rare, inherited disorder caused by a deficiency of the enzyme HPRT, human neural stem cells (hNSCs) that carry this mutation are a precious source for delineating the consequences of HPRT deficiency and for developing new treatments. In our study we have examined the effect of HPRT deficiency on the differentiation of neurons in hNSCs isolated from human LND fetal brain. We have examined the expression of a number of transcription factors essential for neuronal differentiation and marker genes involved in dopamine (DA) biosynthetic pathway. LND hNSCs demonstrate aberrant expression of several transcription factors and DA markers. HPRT-deficient dopaminergic neurons also demonstrate a striking deficit in neurite outgrowth. These results represent direct experimental evidence for aberrant neurogenesis in LND hNSCs and suggest developmental roles for other housekeeping genes in neurodevelopmental disease. Moreover, exposure of the LND hNSCs to retinoic acid medium elicited the generation of dopaminergic neurons. The lack of precise understanding of the neurological dysfunction in LND has precluded development of useful therapies. These results evidence aberrant neurogenesis in LND hNSCs and suggest a role for HPRT gene in neurodevelopment. These cells combine the peculiarity of a neurodevelopmental model and a human, neural origin to provide an important tool to investigate the pathophysiology of HPRT deficiency and more broadly demonstrate the utility of human neural stem cells for studying the disease and identifying potential therapeutics.

Human embryonic stem (ES) cells are pluripotent cells derived from blastocyst-stage embryos. It has been suggested that these cells should play a major role in transplantation medicine and be able to advance our knowledge in human embryology. We propose that these cells should also play a vital role in the creation of models of human disorders. This aspect would be most valuable where animal models failed to faithfully recapitulate the human phenotype. Lesch-Nyhan disease is caused by a mutation in the HPRT1 gene that triggers an overproduction of uric acid, causing gout-like symptoms and urinary stones, in addition to neurological disorders. Due to biochemical differences between humans and rodents, a mouse lacking the HPRT expression will fail to accumulate uric acid. In this research we demonstrate a model for Lesch-Nyhan disease by mutating the HPRT1 gene in human ES cells using homologous recombination. We have verified the mutation in the HPRT1 allele at the DNA and RNA levels. By using selection media, we show that HPRT1 activity is abolished in the mutant cells, and the HPRT1-cells show a higher rate of uric acid accumulation than the wild-type cells. Therefore, these cells recapitulate to some extent the characteristics of Lesch-Nyhan syndrome and can help researchers further investigate this genetic disease and analyze drugs that will prevent the onset of its symptoms. We therefore suggest that human diseases may be modeled using human ES cells.

Lesch-Nyhan disease and its attenuated variants are caused by mutations in the HPRT1 gene, which encodes the purine recycling enzyme hypoxanthine-guanine phosphoribosyltransferase. The mutations are heterogeneous, with more than 400 different mutations already documented. Prior efforts to correlate variations in the clinical phenotype with different mutations have suggested that milder phenotypes typically are associated with mutants that permit some residual enzyme function, whereas the most severe phenotype is associated with null mutants. However, multiple exceptions to this concept have been reported. In the current studies 44 HPRT1 mutations associated with a wide spectrum of clinical phenotypes were reconstructed by site-directed mutagenesis, the mutant enzymes were expressed in vitro and purified, and their kinetic properties were examined toward their substrates hypoxanthine, guanine, and phosphoribosylpyrophosphate. The results provide strong evidence for a correlation between disease severity and residual catalytic activity of the enzyme (k(cat)) toward each of its substrates as well as several mechanisms that result in exceptions to this correlation. There was no correlation between disease severity and the affinity of the enzyme for its substrates (K(m)). These studies provide a valuable model for understanding general principles of genotype-phenotype correlations in human disease, as the mechanisms involved are applicable to many other disorders.

Five independent mutations in the hypoxanthine guanine phosphoribosyltransferase (HPRT) gene were identified in a partially HPRT deficient patient with gout and in four Lesch-Nyhan patients. Using the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) technique coupled with direct sequencing, the nucleotide sequences of the entire HPRT coding region amplified from the cDNA and also of each exon amplified form the genomic DNA were analyzed. Three independent point mutations in the coding region were detected in the partially HPRT deficient patient (Case 1) and in two Lesch-Nyhan patients (Case 2 and 3), resulting in single amino acid substitutions. The family study of Case 3, utilizing a PvuII restriction site created in the mutant gene, indicated that the mother was a heterozygote, and a sister and a fetal brother had inherited the normal HPRT gene from the mother. In two other mutants causing Lesch-Nyhan syndrome, a portion of the HPRT gene was deleted, and RNA splicing was missing in both mutants. A 4-bp deletion at the 5' end of exon 4 resulted in formation of three different types of abnormal mRNA (Case 4). The other mutant (Case 5) produced abnormal mRNA including 26 bp of intron 8 instead of the deleted 58 bp at the 5' end of exon 9, because of a 74-bp deletion from intron 8 to exon 9.

We have investigated the molecular basis of hypoxanthine-guanine phosphoribosyltransferase (HPRT) deficiency in a patient who presented with the Lesch-Nyhan syndrome. A catalytically incompetent form of HPRT has been isolated from this patient's erythrocytes and lymphoblasts. This enzyme variant, which we have termed HPRTKinston, is indistinguishable from the normal enzyme in terms of its intracellular concentration and maximal velocity, but differs with respect to its isoelectric point (more basic) and Michaelis constants for both substrates (markedly elevated). The tryptic peptides of HPRTKinston were mapped by reverse-phase high pressure liquid chromatography in an attempt to define the precise abnormality in its primary structure. Sequence analysis of the single aberrant tryptic peptide in HPRTKinston revealed an aspartic acid to asparagine amino acid substitution at position 193. Electrophoretic analysis of the CNBr peptides of HPRTKinston confirmed the location of the proposed mutation. This amino acid substitution can be explained by a single nucleotide change in the codon for aspartic acid 193 (GAC leads to AAC). This is the first specific mutation described at the molecular level in a patient with the Lesch-Nyhan syndrome.

The Lesch-Nyhan syndrome is an X-linked recessive inherited disease caused by a complete deficiency of hypoxanthine guanine phosphoribosyl-transferase (HPRT) activity. Many different mutations throughout the HPRT coding region of Lesch-Nyhan patients have been described, including single base substitutions, partial or entire gene deletions, gene insertions or endoduplication of exons. However, study of gene mutation in Chinese patients has rarely been reported in Taiwan. Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and nucleotide sequence analysis were used to identify the location and the nature of the mutation at the HPRT locus in two brothers affected with Lesch-Nyhan syndrome. The HPRT cDNA, amplified from total RNA of patient's peripheral blood by reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction, was cloned into a pGEM-3Zf(-) vector and then sequenced. Family study involved initial screening using single-strand conformation polymorphism, and further confirmation by direct sequencing of the exon encompassing the mutation. The mutation identified in these two affected siblings was a single nucleotide substitution, from cytosine to guanine, in exon 3 of the HPRT coding region. This transversion putatively caused a single amino acid substitution from phenylalanine to leucine at codon 74 in the translated protein. This base change was further confirmed by direct sequencing of both the HPRT cDNA fragment and the exon 3 of HPRT gene amplified from genomic DNA. The family study revealed that the patient's mother was a heterozygous carrier, and the mutation seemed to have occurred de novo in a germinal cell from one of the maternal grandparents. This is the first family study on Chinese patients with Lesch-Nyhan syndrome identified by molecular analysis in Taiwan. The mutation described herein is a novel substitution which occurs in a suggested "hotspot" of mutation (exon 3) of the HPRT gene. The application of molecular analysis of HPRT-gene allows not only DNA diagnosis by directly detecting the mutant alleles, but also prenatal diagnosis and carrier identification within individual families affected by Lesch-Nyhan syndrome.

Human HPRT deficiency leads to two major forms of human disease. Partial enzyme deficiency results in gouty arthritis, while an almost complete deficiency leads to the Lesch-Nyhan disease. The latter is characterized by severe neurological dysfunction in addition to gouty arthritis, including retardation, choreoathetosis and aggressive and compulsive self-mutilation. The biochemical basis for the neurological symptoms is not understood. The human and mouse cDNA (RNA copy) genes have been isolated and sequenced. In addition, the amino acid sequence of the human protein has been directly determined. The human and mouse proteins differ at 7 amino acids out of the total, (including the N terminal methionine, which is processed off during maturation) of 218. There are 42 out of 654 nucleotide differences between the human and mouse genes in the amino acid coding region. The mouse genomic structure has been determined. It has 9 exons and 8 introns with a total size of approximately 36 kb. The human gene is very similar with identical intron-exon junction points and approximately the same total gene size. Both mouse and human presumed promotor region at the 5' end, lack a recognizable promotor in the form of a "TATAA" box and are very G-C rich, though not the same. This may be a feature of most "housekeeping" genes. HPRT gene point mutations in three gouty arthritis and one Lesch-Nyhan patient have been identified by peptide sequencing. Six gross gene rearrangements have been identified in Lesch-Nyhan HPRT genes. However it is likely that most mutations are point mutations or small deletions. So far all gene mutations identified are different from all others. The gene has been engineered into retrovirus vehicles which allows its efficient introduction into a wide variety of cells, including mouse marrow stem cells. This may allow treatment of Lesch-Nyhan patients as a model of gene therapy.

Lesch-Nyhan disease (LND) is caused by lack of hypoxanthine-guanine phosphoribosyltransferase (HPRT) activity. Mutations in HPRT1 gene show variability in type and location within the gene, and in certain patients the HPRT coding sequence is normal and the molecular defect cannot be found. These patients presented a decreased HPRT1 expression of unknown cause. This is the first report of a carrier and prenatal diagnosis of LND due to a defect in HPRT gene expression regulation.

Mouse malignant teratocarcinoma cells, upon injection into early embryos at the blastocyst stage, become integrated into the developing embryo and stably normalized. In the mosaic mice that are formed, tumor-derived cells can give rise to the full range of normal, functional somatic tissues, and also to germ cells from which progeny are obtained. Totipotent mouse teratocarcinoma cells thus provide a new and essentially parasexual means of generating entire animals. The advantages of in vitro and in vivo technologies can now therefore be combined to synthesize mice with experimentally useful mutations. After mutagenization of the teratocarcinoma cells in culture, and selection or screening for the desired mutant phenotype, cells of mutant clones are microinjected into genetically marked blastocysts for further differentiation and full gene expression within the framework of the organism. An example is the isolation, by 6-thioguanine resistance, of cells deficient in hypoxanthine-guanine phosphoribosyl transferase -- the same deficiency that characterizes human patients with the X-linked Lesch-Nyhan disease. In work in progress, these cells have been cycled into genetically marked blastocysts, where the tumor lineage has successfully given rise to fully differentiated tissue contributions in which the enzyme defect persists. Such experiments present numerous possibilities for introducing specific mutations into mice, toward the ends of studying gene mechanisms responsible for differentiation and of producing animal models of human genetic diseases. Teratocarcinoma cells may also serve as vehicles for introducing foreign genetic material into mice in order to facilitate analyses of gene control mechanisms in development and disease.

Mutations identified in the hypoxanthine phosphoribosyltransferase (HPRT) gene of patients with Lesch-Nyhan (LN) syndrome are dominated by simple base substitutions. Few hotspot positions have been identified, and only three large genomic rearrangements have been characterized at the molecular level. We have identified one novel mutation, two tentative hot spot mutations, and two deletions by direct sequencing of HPRT cDNA or genomic DNA from fibroblasts or T-lymphocytes from LN patients in five unrelated families. One is a missense mutation caused by a 610C-->T transition of the first base of HPRT exon 9. This mutation has not been described previously in an LN patient. A nonsense mutation caused by a 508C-->T transition at a CpG site in HPRT exon 7 in the second patient and his younger brother is the fifth mutation of this kind among LN patients. Another tentative hotspot mutation in the third patient, a frame shift caused by a G nucleotide insertion in a monotonous repeat of six Gs in HPRT exon 3, has been reported previously in three other LN patients. The fourth patient had a tandem deletion: a 57-bp deletion in an internally repeated Alu-sequence of intron 1 was separated by 14 bp from a 627-bp deletion that included HPRT exon 2 and was flanked by a 4-bp repeat. This complex mutation is probably caused by a combination of homologous recombination and replication slippage. Another large genomic deletion of 2969 bp in the fifth patient extended from one Alu-sequence in the promoter region to another Alu-sequence of intron 1, deleting the whole of HPRT exon 1. The breakpoints were located within two 39-bp homologous sequences, one of which overlapped with a well-conserved 26-bp Alu-core sequence previously suggested as promoting recombination. These results contribute to the establishment of a molecular spectrum of LN mutations, support previous data indicating possible mutational hotspots, and provide evidence for the involvement of Alu-mediated recombination in HPRT deletion mutagenesis.

Deficiency of hypoxanthine-guanine phosphoribosyltransferase (HPRT) activity is an inborn error of purine metabolism associated with uric acid overproduction and a continuum spectrum of neurological manifestations depending on the degree of enzyme deficiency. The complete deficiency causes Lesch-Nyhan syndrome (LNS). Partial HPRT-deficient patients can show a variable degree of neurological manifestations. Both diseases have been associated with mutations in the HPRT1 gene. Documented mutations in HPRT deficiency show a high degree of heterogeneity in type and location within the gene. In fact, more than 300 disease-associated mutations have been described. Splice mutations accounts for more that 16% of HPRT mutations and in most cases cause a complete LNS phenotype. A 16 year-old boy consulted to La Paz University Hospital because of hyperuricemia (9.4 mg/dL). At age one year he was given a diagnosis of dystonic cerebral palsy. Although he usually employs a wheelchair, under certain circumstances, he is able to stand up and walk by himself. He has never showed self injurious behavior. This patient presented a splice mutation (NM_000194.2: c.552 -2 A > G) causing exon 5 exclusion. An exon-5 specific PCR was designed, and a minor amount of normally spliced HPRT mRNA was found. Normally spliced HPRT mRNA was quantified by real-time PCR in this patient, in control subjects, and in two Lesch Nyhan patient with splice mutations excluding exon 4 (patient B) and exon 8 (patient C) who had clinically a Lesch Nyhan disease phenotype. A minor amount of normally spliced HPRT mRNA was found in all the patients. No correlation was found between the percentage of the normally spliced HPRT mRNA and the phenotype. We conclude that the partial HPRT deficient phenotype of this patient can not be explained by the finding of a minor amount of normally splice HPRT mRNA. It is possible that the amount of normally splice mRNA vary among different tissues.

Mutations in the X chromosome hypoxanthine-guanine phosphoribosyl transferase (HPRT) gene are responsible for Lesch-Nyhan syndrome and related diseases in humans. Because the gene is on the X chromosome, males are affected and females in the families are at risk of being carriers of the mutation. Because there are so many different mutations that can cause the disease (218 different mutations in 271 families), genetic testing for carrier status of females requires detailed molecular analysis of the familial mutation. This analysis can be complicated by the unavailability of an affected male for study. In addition, when the mutation is a deletion (34 reported instances), molecular analysis in females is difficult because of the two X chromosomes. We have applied a peripheral blood T lymphocyte cloning assay that uses resistance to the purine analogue 6-thioguanine (TG) to measure the frequency of cells in females expressing a mutant HPRT allele to determine mutation carrier status in 123 females in 61 families. In families in which the HPRT mutation was determined and could be easily analyzed in samples from females, we found a mean (+/- SD) mutant frequency of 9.7 (+/- 8.7) x 10(-6) in noncarrier females and 2.9 (+/- 3.0) x 10(-2) in carrier females. The frequency in carrier females is less than the 0.5 expected for nonrandom X inactivation because of in vivo selection against HPRT mutation-expressing T lymphocytes or stem cells during prenatal development. The use of this cloning assay allows determination of the carrier status of females even when the HPRT mutation is not yet known or is difficult to determine in DNA samples from females. This approach provides a rapid assay that yields information on carrier status within 10 days of sample receipt.

For three patients with the Lesch-Nyhan syndrome the existence of normal amounts of catalytically inactive hypoxanthine-guanine phosphoribosyltransferase (HGPRT) protein was demonstrated by using antibodies against the normal enzyme subunits. The lack of enzyme activity is reverted in virus transformed cells. Individual revertant cell clones contain different HGPRT enzymes as demonstrated here by isoelectric focusing. The data strongly support the idea of a structural gene mutation as the cause of enzyme deficiency in the Lesch-Nyhan syndrome.

Lesch-Nyhan syndrome is a rare X-linked recessive disorder of purine metabolism associated with a virtually complete deficiency of the enzyme hypoxanthine-guanine phosphoribosyl-transferase (HPRT). The disease is characterized by hyperuricemia, self-multilation, choreoathetosis, spasticity, and mental retardation. The abnormalities of purine metabolism are present at birth and may lead to uric acid crystalluria and stone formation early in life. Radiographic findings described in Lesch-Nyhan syndrome include faintly radio-opaque stones on abdominal radiographs or, if renal disease is present, small kidneys with poor function on intravenous urogram. Radiolucent stones are usually composed of uric acid; however, several cases of xanthine and hypoxanthine-containing calculi in Lesch-Nyhan patients receiving allopurinl therapy have also been described. Oxypurine is the collective name for the compounds hypoxanthine, xanthine, and uric acid, and all may be radiolucent. We report a case of Lesch-Nyhan syndrome with presumed renal parenchymal oxypurine deposition demonstrated readily by ultrasonography but not detected on standard radiographs or intravenous urograms.

The molecular basis for complete hypoxanthine guanine phosphoribosyltransferase (HPRT) deficiency has been determined in a patient with Lesch-Nyhan syndrome. A B-lymphoblastoid cell line derived from this patient expresses normal amounts of HPRT mRNA yet no detectable immunoreactive protein as determined by radioimmunoassay. These findings suggest either a decreased rate of translation or accelerated degradation due to enhanced proteolytic susceptibility. cDNAs synthesized from this patient's RNA have a single nucleotide (nt) substitution, a C----A transversion at nt 222. RNase A cleavage analysis confirms the presence of a mutation at this position within mRNA isolated from lymphoblasts from patient A.C. This transversion predicts a phenylalanine to leucine replacement at amino acid position 73 in the translated protein. We have designated this mutant HPRTFlint. The mutation in HPRTFlint disrupts a strongly conserved region among PRTases from Escherichia coli, rodents and man, suggesting an important role for this region for the normal function of HPRT. Since it is unlikely that this amino acid substitution alters the translational rate, we hypothesize that disruption of the secondary structure within this region renders HPRTFlint more susceptible to proteolysis.

The Lesch-Nyhan syndrome is characterized clinically by choreoathetosis, spasticity, selfmutilation, and mental and growth retardation. Biochemically, there is a striking reduction of hypoxanthine-guanine phosphoribosyltransferase (HGPRT) activity in affected individuals. We have examined erythrocytes from 14 patients with the Lesch-Nyhan syndrome for the presence of hypoxanthine-guanine phosphoribosyltransferase activity and enzyme protein. In contrast to the usual finding of no detectable hypoxanthine-guanine phosphoribosyltransferase activity, we have found low levels (0.002-0.79 nmoles/mg protein per hr) of hypoxanthine-guanine phosphoribosyltransferase activity in erythrocyte lysates from five of these patients. In three of the five patients, hypoxanthine-guanine phosphoribosyltransferase activity appeared to be substantially more labile in vivo than normal using erythrocytes which had been separated according to their density (age). Immunochemical studies using a monospecific antiserum prepared from a homogeneous preparation of normal human erythrocyte hypoxanthine-guanine phosphoribosyltransferase revealed immunoreactive protein (CRM) in hemolysate from all 14 patients with the Lesch-Nyhan syndrome. The immunoreactive protein from each patient gave a reaction of complete identity with normal erythrocyte hypoxanthine-guanine phosphoribosyltransferase and was present in quantities equal to those observed in normal erythrocytes. In addition, a constant amount of CRM was found in erythrocytes of increasing density (age) from patients with the Lesch-Nyhan syndrome despite the decreasing hypoxanthine-guanine phosphoribosyltransferase activity. These studies confirm previous data which indicate that the mutations leading to the Lesch-Nyhan syndrome are usually, if not always on the structural gene coding for hypoxanthine-guanine phosphoribosyltransferase. In addition, although the mutant proteins appear to be present in normal amounts, they are often very labile in vivo with respect to enzymatic activity. These observations suggest that therapy directed at stabilization or activation of enzyme activity in vivo may be of potential benefit.

We describe a family of seven boys affected by Lesch-Nyhan disease with various phenotypes. Further investigations revealed a mutation c.203T>C in the gene encoding HGprt of all members, with substitution of leucine to proline at residue 68 (p.Leu68Pro). Thus patients from this family display a wide variety of symptoms although sharing the same mutation. Mutant HGprt enzyme was prepared by site-directed mutagenesis and the kinetics of the enzyme revealed that the catalytic activity of the mutant was reduced, in association with marked reductions in the affinity towards phosphoribosylpyrophosphate (PRPP). Its Km for PRPP was increased 215-fold with hypoxanthine as substrate and 40-fold with guanine as substrate with associated reduced catalytic potential. Molecular modeling confirmed that the most prominent defect was the dramatically reduced affinity towards PRPP. Our studies suggest that the p.Leu68Pro mutation has a strong impact on PRPP binding and on stability of the active conformation. This suggests that factors other than HGprt activity per se may influence the phenotype of Lesch-Nyhan patients.

Lesch-Nyhan disease (LND) is caused by deficiency of hypoxanthine guanine phosphoribosyltransferase (HPRT). The aim of the present study is to characterize the molecular deficiency of a clinical diagnosed Chinese patient with attenuated variant of LND. The coding region and the intron-exon boundaries of HPRT1 gene were sequenced by standard methods, and HPRT activity was assayed by HPLC method. Structure analysis was performed to estimate the consequence of the mutant of HPRT1 gene. A new mutation c.245T>G (p.Ile82Ser) was identified in this patient, and heterozygous mutation was found in the patient's mother. The activity of HPRT in the patient was completely undetectable. Structure study indicates that the mutation of p.Ile82Ser may lead to loss of hydrophobic side chain and disrupt its normal conformation of HPRT protein. It is helpful for diagnosis of LND that sequencing analysis of HPRT1 gene is performed in male infant and juvenile with hyperuricaemia and neurologic dysfunction in Chinese.

Whole genomic hprt clones were used in Southern analysis to screen the integrity of the hprt gene in a family that includes a patient with HPRT enzyme deficiency causal to Lesch-Nyhan syndrome. A 5 kb DNA sequence deletion was found to have its endpoints in the first and third introns. The probes identified the carrier status of female family members, aided by an RFLP carried by the mother's normal X-chromosome.

De novo purine biosynthesis has been studied in lymphocyte cell lines established from Lesch-Nyhan patients deficient in hypoxanthine-guanine phosphoribosyltransferase (HGPRT), in in vitro differentiating erythroleukaemic cell lines cloned from cells charactistic of virus-induced murine leukaemia, and in mutant hamster cells deficient in amidophosphoribosyltransferase. The relationship between cellular phosphoribosylpyrophosphate (PP-ribose-P) metabolism and the activity of the enzymes which catalyse the early steps of de novo purine biosynthesis has been explored. It was found that hamster cells deficient in amidophosphoribosyltransferase did not accumulate PP-ribose-P as do HGPRT-deficient cells. In these model systems, an accelerated rate of de novo purine biosynthesis tended to be associated with an increase in cellular PP-ribose-P cotent, but decreases in this rate results from the reduction in the activity of amidophosphoribosyltransferase. Regulation of ammonia-dependent de novo purine biosynthesis was similar to that of glutamine-dependent purine biosynthesis.

Mutations in the HPRT gene cause a spectrum of diseases that ranges from hyperuricemia alone to hyperuricemia with profound neurological and behavioral dysfunction. The extreme phenotype is termed Lesch-Nyhan syndrome. In 271 cases in which the germinal HPRT mutation has been characterized, 218 different mutations have been found. Of these, 34 (13%) are large- (macro-) deletions of one exon or greater and four (2%) are partial gene duplications. The deletion breakpoint junctions have been defined for only three of the 34 macro-deletions. The molecular basis of two of the four duplications has been defined. We report here the breakpoint junctions for three new deletion mutations, encompassing exons 4-8 (20033bp), exons 4 and 5 (13307bp) and exons 5 and 6 (9454bp), respectively. The deletion breakpoints were defined by a combination of long polymerase chain reaction (PCR) amplifications, and conventional PCR and DNA sequencing. All three deletions are the result of non-homologous recombinations. A fourth mutation, a duplication of exons 2 and 3, is the result of an Alu-mediated homologous recombination between identical 19bp sequences in introns 3 and 1. In toto, two of three germinal HPRT duplication mutations appear to have been caused by Alu-mediated homologous recombination, while only one of six deletion mutations appears to have resulted from this type of recombination mechanism. The other five deletion mutations resulted from non-homologous recombination. With this admittedly limited number of characterized macro-mutations, Alu-mediated unequal homologous recombinations account for at least 8% (3 of 38) of the macro-alterations and 1% (3 of 271) of the total HPRT germinal mutations.
