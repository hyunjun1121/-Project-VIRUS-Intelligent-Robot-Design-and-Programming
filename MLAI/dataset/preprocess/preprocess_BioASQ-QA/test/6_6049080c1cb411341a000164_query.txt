In Asia, Qi-Wei-Du-Qi-Wan (QWDQW) is a traditional Chinese medicine that has been used to treat chest tightness, cough, shortness of breath, night sweats, frequent urination and asthma. QWDQW is recorded in Yi Zong Yi Ren Pian (Medical Physician's Compilation), which was written by Yang Cheng Liu during the Qing Dynasty. The traditional Chinese medicine QWDQW is composed of 7 ingredients and has been used in the treatment of asthma in Asia for hundreds of years. However, the mechanism through which QWDQW affects the immune system in the treatment of asthma is not known. Therefore, this study aimed to investigate whether QWDQW alleviates asthmatic symptoms in mice with chronic asthma induced by repeated stimulation with Dermatophagoides pteronyssinus (Der p) and to explore the underlying immune modulatory mechanism. BALB/c mice were stimulated intratracheally (i.t.) with Der p (40 μl, 2.5 μg/μl) once weekly for 6 weeks. Thirty minutes prior to Der p stimulation, the mice were treated with QWDQW (0.5 g/kg and 0.17 g/kg) orally. Three days after the last stimulation, the mice were sacrificed, and infiltration of inflammatory cells, lung histological characteristics, gene expression of lung and serum total IgE were assessed. In other experiments, RBL-2H3 cells were stimulated with DNP-IgE/DNP-BSA and then treated with QWDQW, quercetin, β-carotene, luteolin or a mixture of the three chemicals (Mix13) for 30 min, and the effects of the drugs on RBL-2H3 cell degranulation after DNP stimulation were determined. QWDQW significantly reduced Der p-induced airway hyperreactivity (AHR) and decreased total serum IgE and Der p-specific IgE levels. Histopathological examination showed that QWDQW reduced inflammatory cell infiltration and sputum secretion from goblet cells in the lungs. Gene expression analysis indicated that QWDQW reduced overproduction of IL-12、IFN-γ、IL-13、IL-4、RNATES、Eotaxin and MCP-1in lung. Additionally, QWDQW and Mix13 suppressed DNP induced RBL-2H3 degranulation, and the effect was maximal when quercetin, β-carotene and luteolin were administered together. These results indicate that QWDQW plays a role in suppressing excessive airway reaction and in specific immune modulation in a mouse model of chronic asthma and that QWDQW suppresses mast cell degranulation at defined doses of quercetin, β-carotene and luteolin.

The epithelial lining of the small intestine consists of multiple cell types, including Paneth cells and goblet cells, that work in cohort to maintain gut health. 3D in vitro cultures of human primary epithelial cells, called organoids, have become a key model to study the functions of Paneth cells and goblet cells in normal and diseased conditions. Advances in these models include the ability to skew differentiation to particular lineages, providing a useful tool to study cell type specific function/dysfunction in the context of the epithelium. Here, we use comprehensive profiling of mRNA, microRNA and long non-coding RNA expression to confirm that Paneth cell and goblet cell enrichment of murine small intestinal organoids (enteroids) establishes a physiologically accurate model. We employ network analysis to infer the regulatory landscape altered by skewing differentiation, and using knowledge of cell type specific markers, we predict key regulators of cell type specific functions: Cebpa, Jun, Nr1d1 and Rxra specific to Paneth cells, Gfi1b and Myc specific for goblet cells and Ets1, Nr3c1 and Vdr shared between them. Links identified between these regulators and cellular phenotypes of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) suggest that global regulatory rewiring during or after differentiation of Paneth cells and goblet cells could contribute to IBD aetiology. Future application of cell type enriched enteroids combined with the presented computational workflow can be used to disentangle multifactorial mechanisms of these cell types and propose regulators whose pharmacological targeting could be advantageous in treating IBD patients with Crohn's disease or ulcerative colitis.

Conjunctival goblet cells (CGCs) are specialized cells that produce and secrete soluble mucins to the tear film that bathes the ocular surface. CGC numbers and functions are affected in various ocular surface diseases including dry eye disease with diverse etiologies. In this review we will (i) summarize the important functions of CGCs in ocular surface health, (ii) describe the ocular surface diseases that affect CGC numbers and function, (iii) provide an update on recent research outcomes that elucidate CGC differentiation, gene expression and functions, and (iv) present evidence in support of the prediction that restoring CGC numbers and/or functions is a viable strategy for alleviating ocular surface disorders that impact the CGCs.

Goblet cells (GCs) and endocrine cells (ECs) play an important role in intestine physiology, and few studies currently exist for Amazonian fishes. This study aimed to quantify the distribution of GCs and ECs producing cholecystokinin-8 and neuropeptide Y, assessed by mucin histochemistry and peptides immunohistochemistry, in the intestine of two Amazonian species with different feeding habits Tambaqui (Colossosoma macropomum) and hybrid catfish (Pseudoplatystoma reticulatum × Leiarius marmoratus), an omnivore and carnivore, respectively. A systematic literature review correlating feeding habit and GC and EC distribution was also included to contribute to the comparative study. The results of this study provided novel information about the gut cells of Tambaqui and hybrid catfish. Both, GCs and ECs can be found sweeping the entire intestine of Tambaqui and hybrid catfish although the cells can be more concentrated in certain segments. The GCs and ECs in Tambaqui were more uniformly distributed in the midgut segments (T1, T2, and T3). Unlike, in hybrid catfish GCs were more concentrated in the hindgut (C4) and ECs mainly in the two midgut segments (C1 and C2) of hybrid catfish. Based on the comparison between Tambaqui, hybrid catfish, and other fishes in the literature review, we suggest that cell distribution can be partially explained by feeding habits, carnivorous vs. omnivorous.

This study describes anatomical, histological and histochemical features of the digestive tract mucosal layer of the matrinxã Brycon amazonicus, an omnivorous freshwater fish endemic from the Amazon basin. This species presents short thick oesophagus with longitudinal folds, that allow the passage of large food items. The mucosa is lined with a stratified secretory epithelium rich in goblet cells that secrete neutral and acid mucins. The two mucin types provide different viscosity in anterior and posterior oesophagus related to the protective and lubricant functions, respectively. The stomach is a highly distensible Y-shaped saccular organ. Here, it is proposed that this anatomical shape plays an essential role in food storage when food availability is abundant. The stomach mucosa is composed of epithelial cells with intense neutral mucin secretion to protects against gastric juice. The intestine is slightly coiled and presents internally a complex pattern of transversal folds that increases the absorption surface and the retention time of food. Goblet cells in the intestine secrete acid and neutral mucins that lubricate the epithelium and aid in the digestive processes. In the rectum, an increase in goblet cells population occurs that may be related to better lubrication.

In asthma, goblet cell numbers are increased within the airway epithelium, perpetuating the production of mucus that is more difficult to clear and results in airway mucus plugging. Notch1, Notch2, or Notch3, or a combination of these has been shown to influence the differentiation of airway epithelial cells. How the expression of specific Notch isoforms differs in fully differentiated adult asthmatic epithelium and whether Notch influences mucin production after differentiation is currently unknown. We aimed to quantify different Notch isoforms in the airway epithelium of individuals with severe asthma and to examine the impact of Notch signaling on mucin MUC5AC. Human lung sections and primary bronchial epithelial cells from individuals with and without asthma were used in this study. Primary bronchial epithelial cells were differentiated at the air-liquid interface for 28 days. Notch isoform expression was analyzed by Taqman quantitative PCR. Immunohistochemistry was used to localize and quantify Notch isoforms in human airway sections. Notch signaling was inhibited <i>in vitro</i> using dibenzazepine or Notch3-specific siRNA, followed by analysis of MUC5AC. NOTCH3 was highly expressed in asthmatic airway epithelium compared with nonasthmatic epithelium. Dibenzazepine significantly reduced MUC5AC production in air-liquid interface cultures of primary bronchial epithelial cells concomitantly with suppression of NOTCH3 intracellular domain protein. Specific knockdown using <i>NOTCH3</i> siRNA recapitulated the dibenzazepine-induced reduction in MUC5AC. We demonstrate that NOTCH3 is a regulator of MUC5AC production. Increased NOTCH3 signaling in the asthmatic airway epithelium may therefore be an underlying driver of excess MUC5AC production.
