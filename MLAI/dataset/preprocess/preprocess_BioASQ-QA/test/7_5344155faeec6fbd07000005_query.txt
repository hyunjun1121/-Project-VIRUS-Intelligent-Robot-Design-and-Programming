What is the inheritance pattern of Hunter disease or mucopolysaccharidosis II?

[PMID: 3100113]
A 2.5-year-old girl who presented with abdominal distension, hepatomegaly, coarse facies, hirsutism and contraction deformities was investigated for mucopolysaccharidoses. Urinary excretion showed increased total glycosaminoglycans (105 mg/mmol creatinine; normal for age 9-20 mg/mmol) with marked increases of dermatan and heparan sulphates. A number of lysosomal enzyme activities were measured on leucocytes, serum and cultured fibroblasts. Normal or high activities were found for alpha-iduronidase, N-acetylgalactosamine-6-sulphatase, beta-galactosidase, arylsulphatase B and beta-glucuronidase. However a marked deficiency of iduronate sulphate sulphatase activity was observed, consistent with a diagnosis of Hunter's disease. Activities were reduced to less than 2% of mean control values in the patient's leucocytes, serum and cultured fibroblasts. Normal activities were measured in samples from the father and younger sister but a partial deficiency (43% of control serum) was found in the mother. Chromosome studies on the patient revealed a partial deletion of the long arm of one X-chromosome, most probably of band Xq25, which was not inherited from either parent. Studies using BrdU indicated that the deleted X chromosome was consistently late replicating, and as a result the Hunter gene was fully expressed on the other X chromosome.

A female child of healthy, unrelated parents presented at 12 months of age with a history of moderately severe developmental delay, macrocephaly, dysmorphic facies, hypotonia, hepatosplenomegaly, mild generalized dysostosis multiplex, mucopolysacchariduria (dermatan and heparan sulfates), and Alder-Reilly bodies in peripheral blood leukocytes. Iduronate sulfatase activity in plasma was markedly depressed: 0.11 units/ml/h (normal, 1.75 +/- 0.56, N = 6). Analyses of arylsulfatases A, B, and C, heparan N-sulfatase, alpha-mannosidase, beta-mannosidase, beta-glucuronidase, beta-hexosaminidase, beta-galactosidase, and alpha-fucosidase activities in plasma, leukocytes, and/or cultured skin fibroblasts were all normal. Urinary sulfatide excretion was also within normal limits. Karyotypes of peripheral blood leukocytes and cultured skin fibroblasts were normal. Serum iduronate sulfatase activities in the parents were in the normal range (father, 1.63 units/ml/h; mother, 1.25 units/ml/h). The results of analyses of restriction fragment length polymorphisms (RFLP) of DNA from cultured skin fibroblasts with the use of probes for loci extending from Xpter to Xq28 showed X chromosome heterozygosity and confirmed the paternal origin of one of the X chromosomes. Studies on sulfur-35 uptake in mixed fibroblast cultures showed cross-correction of [35S]-glycosaminoglycan accumulation between cells from the patient and normal cells or cells from a patient with Hurler disease; however, there was no cross-correction between cells from the patient and those from boys affected with classical Hunter disease. This represents only the second confirmed case of Hunter disease reported in a karyotypically normal girl.

Profound iduronate sulfatase deficiency, characteristic of the Hunter syndrome, has been found in cultured fibroblasts, serum, lymphocytes, and tissues of two clinically affected girls. The patients are karyotypically normal and have normal fathers; cloning of the mothers' fibroblasts did not reveal the mosaicism expected of carriers of an X-linked disease. Homozygosity for a previously unsuspected autosomal recessive gene for iduronate sulfatase is considered the most likely explanation, although heterozygosity for the X-linked gene and subsequent selection cannot be completely excluded.

Hunter syndrome is an X-linked recessive disorder. Determination of heterozygotes is of vital importance in genetic counselling. We describe the DNA linkage analysis in 6 Hunter syndrome families and compare it to previous results based on a serum assay for IDS activity. Our results confirm the reliability of the serum assay. The serum test correctly detected 11/12 of the 1st degree relatives tested by the serum assay (6/7 carriers and 5/5 non-carriers). The only case with an apparent false negative result in the serum test was a daughter of a "probable heterozygote" whose serum test was also negative. We suggest that in this family the mother represented a case of germinal mosaicism and her daughter, based on the serum test, was not a carrier. If our interpretation is correct, then the apparent false negative results were correct. It is concluded that in families where the mutation is not known and DNA analysis is not possible due to the lack of informative RFLPs or due to the lack of DNA samples on key individuals, as well as in sporadic cases, the serum test should be applied as an alternative option for heterozygote detection.

Hunter disease, Mucopolysaccharidosis type II, is an X-linked recessive lysosomal storage disorder caused by a deficiency in iduronate sulfatase activity. We studied at molecular level a Neapolitan family with the disease. We report, in patient, the delta 139 mutation on the third exon of the gene, on female family members, the DNA analysis that allowed to assess or exclude their carrier status and on fetal DNA from a pregnancy of patient's mother, a prenatal diagnosis that resulted negative.

Hunter disease, an X-linked recessive lethal, has recently been observed to occur in high frequency in Israeli Jews as compared with other Caucasian populations. Using the equilibrium distribution of the number of affected males, one can computed the probability that the excess frequency is due to genetic drift. Our results demonstrate that the elevated frequency of Hunter disease is compatible with drift.

Most lysosomal diseases (LD) are inherited as autosomal recessive traits, but two important conditions have X-linked inheritance: Fabry disease and Mucopolysaccharidosis II (MPS II). These two diseases show a very different pattern regarding expression on heterozygotes, which does not seem to be explained by the X-inactivation mechanism only. While MPS II heterozygotes are asymptomatic in most instances, in Fabry disease most of female carriers show some disease manifestation, which is sometimes severe. It is known that there is a major difference among X-linked diseases depending on the cell autonomy of the gene product involved and, therefore, on the occurrence of cross-correction. Since lysosomal enzymes are usually secreted and uptaken by neighbor cells, the different findings between MPS II and Fabry disease heterozygotes can also be due to different efficiency of cross-correction (higher in MPS II and lower in Fabry disease). In this paper, we review these two X-linked LD in order to discuss the mechanisms that could explain the different rates of penetrance and expressivity observed in the heterozygotes; this could be helpful to better understand the expression of X-linked traits.
