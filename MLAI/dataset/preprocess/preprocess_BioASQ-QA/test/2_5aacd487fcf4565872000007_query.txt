Which human gene encode for DNA polymerase θ?

[PMID: 27264557]
DNA polymerase theta (pol θ) is encoded in the genomes of many eukaryotes, though not in fungi. Pol θ is encoded by the POLQ gene in mammalian cells. The C-terminal third of the protein is a family A DNA polymerase with additional insertion elements relative to prokaryotic homologs. The N-terminal third is a helicase-like domain with DNA-dependent ATPase activity. Pol θ is important in the repair of genomic double-strand breaks (DSBs) from many sources. These include breaks formed by ionizing radiation and topoisomerase inhibitors, breaks arising at stalled DNA replication forks, breaks introduced during diversification steps of the mammalian immune system, and DSB induced by CRISPR-Cas9. Pol θ participates in a route of DSB repair termed "alternative end-joining" (altEJ). AltEJ is independent of the DNA binding Ku protein complex and requires DNA end resection. Pol θ is able to mediate joining of two resected 3' ends harboring DNA sequence microhomology. "Signatures" of Pol θ action during altEJ are the frequent utilization of longer microhomologies, and the insertion of additional sequences at joining sites. The mechanism of end-joining employs the ability of Pol θ to tightly grasp a 3' terminus through unique contacts in the active site, allowing extension from minimally paired primers. Pol θ is involved in controlling the frequency of chromosome translocations and preserves genome integrity by limiting large deletions. It may also play a backup role in DNA base excision repair. POLQ is a member of a cluster of similarly upregulated genes that are strongly correlated with poor clinical outcome for breast cancer, ovarian cancer and other cancer types. Inhibition of pol θ is a compelling approach for combination therapy of radiosensitization.

DNA polymerase theta (pol θ) is an evolutionarily conserved protein encoded by the POLQ gene in mammalian genomes. Pol θ is the defining enzyme for a pathway of DSB repair termed "alternative end-joining" (altEJ) or "theta-mediated end-joining." This pathway contributes significantly to the radiation resistance of mammalian cells. It also modulates accuracy in repair of breaks that occur at stalled DNA replication forks, during diversification steps of the mammalian immune system, during repair of CRISPR-Cas9, and in many DNA integration events. Pol θ is a potentially important clinical target, particularly for cancers deficient in other break repair strategies. The enzyme is uniquely able to mediate joining of single-stranded 3' ends. Because of these unusual biochemical properties and its therapeutic importance, it is essential to study structures of pol θ bound to DNA. However, challenges for expression and purification are presented by the large size of pol θ (2590 residues in humans) and unusual juxtaposition of domains (a helicase-like domain and distinct DNA polymerase, separated by a region predicted to be largely disordered). Here we summarize work on the expression and purification of the full-length protein, and then focus on the design, expression, and purification of an active C-terminal polymerase fragment. The generation of this active construct was nontrivial and time consuming. Almost all published biochemical work to date has been performed with this domain fragment. Strategies to obtain and improve crystals of a ternary pol θ complex (enzyme:DNA:nucleotide) are also presented, along with key elements of the structure.
