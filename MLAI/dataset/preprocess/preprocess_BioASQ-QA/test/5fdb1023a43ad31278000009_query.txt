Which gene is responsible for the Liebenberg syndrome?

[PMID: 23940102]
The Liebenberg syndrome was first described in 1973 in a five- generation family. A sixth generation was added in 2001, and in 2009 a hitherto unknown branch of the same family with similar anomalies extended the family tree significantly. This article describes the clinical findings and illustrates the abnormalities with radiographs and three-dimensional computed tomography scans. We discuss the genetic abnormality that causes Liebenberg syndrome, the genomic rearrangement at the PITX1 locus on chromosome 5.The structural variations seem to result in an ectopic expression of paired-like homeodomain transcription factor 1 (PITX1) in the forelimb causing a partial arm-to-leg transformation in these patients.

Structural variants (SVs) affecting non-coding <i>cis</i>-regulatory elements are a common cause of congenital limb malformation. Yet, the functional interpretation of these non-coding variants remains challenging. The human Liebenberg syndrome is characterised by a partial transformation of the arms into legs and has been shown to be caused by SVs at the <i>PITX1</i> locus leading to its misregulation in the forelimb by its native enhancer element Pen. This study aims to elucidate the genetic cause of an unsolved family with a mild form of Liebenberg syndrome and investigate the role of promoters in long-range gene regulation. Here, we identify SVs by whole genome sequencing (WGS) and use CRISPR-Cas9 genome editing in transgenic mice to assign pathogenicity to the SVs. In this study, we used WGS in a family with three mildly affected individuals with Liebenberg syndrome and identified the smallest deletion described so far including the first non-coding exon of <i>H2AFY</i>. To functionally characterise the variant, we re-engineered the 8.5â€‰kb deletion using CRISPR-Cas9 technology in the mouse and showed that the promoter of the housekeeping gene <i>H2afy</i> insulates the Pen enhancer from <i>Pitx1</i> in forelimbs; its loss leads to misexpression of <i>Pitx1</i> by the pan-limb activity of the Pen enhancer causing Liebenberg syndrome. Our data indicate that housekeeping promoters may titrate promiscuous enhancer activity to ensure normal morphogenesis. The deletion of the <i>H2AFY</i> promoter as a cause of Liebenberg syndrome highlights this new mutational mechanism and its role in congenital disease.

Liebenberg syndrome (MIM 186550) is a very rare autosomal dominant condition characterized by three main features: dysplasia of all of the bony components of the elbow joint, abnormalities in the shape of carpal bones, and brachydactyly. In this paper, we report a Saudi Arabian family with Liebenberg syndrome. Comparative genomic hybridization (CGH) revealed a 275-kb deletion within the cytogenetic band 5q31.1 which contains the H2AFY gene and 190,428bp of its downstream region. The deleted region is upstream to the PITX1 gene. The radiological features in the upper limbs of all affected members of the family were almost identical to the phenotype in the mouse model with ectopic expression of Pitx1 in the forelimbs. We therefore re-define the phenotype of Liebenberg syndrome as a transformation of the upper limbs to reflect lower limb characteristics and speculate that the area of deletion contains a regulatory sequence that suppresses the expression of PITX1 in the upper limb buds.

The study of homeotic-transformation mutants in model organisms such as Drosophila revolutionized the field of developmental biology, but how these mutants relate to human developmental defects remains to be elucidated. Here, we show that Liebenberg syndrome, an autosomal-dominant upper-limb malformation, shows features of a homeotic limb transformation in which the arms have acquired morphological characteristics of a leg. Using high-resolution array comparative genomic hybridization and paired-end whole-genome sequencing, we identified two deletions and a translocation 5' of PITX1. The structural changes are likely to remove active PITX1 forelimb suppressor and/or insulator elements and thereby move active enhancer elements in the vicinity of the PITX1 regulatory landscape. We generated transgenic mice in which PITX1 was misexpressed under the control of a nearby enhancer and were able to recapitulate the Liebenberg phenotype.

We report a case of Liebenberg syndrome in a 6-year-old girl, including the clinical, radiological, angiographic, and operative findings. We note that the forearm and hand malformations have similarities to leg and foot anatomy. Our observations may help provide insight into the etiology of this unusual condition.

PITX1 is a homeobox transcription factor essential for hindlimb morphogenesis. Two PITX1-related human disorders have been reported to date: PITX1 ectopic expression causes Liebenberg syndrome, characterized by malformation of upper limbs showing a "lower limb" appearance; PITX1 deletions or missense variation cause a syndromic picture including clubfoot, tibial hemimelia, and preaxial polydactyly. We report two novel PITX1 missense variants, altering PITX1 transactivation ability, in three individuals from two unrelated families showing a distinct recognizable autosomal dominant syndrome, including first branchial arch, pelvic, patellar, and male genital abnormalities. This syndrome shows striking similarities with the Pitx1-/- mouse model. A partial phenotypic overlap is also observed with Ischiocoxopodopatellar syndrome caused by TBX4 haploinsufficiency, and with the phenotypic spectrum caused by SOX9 anomalies, both genes being PITX1 downstream targets. Our study findings expand the spectrum of PITX1-related disorders and suggest a common pattern of developmental abnormalities in disorders of the PITX1-TBX4-SOX9 signaling pathway.
