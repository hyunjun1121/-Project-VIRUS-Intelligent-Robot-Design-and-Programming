What is the indication for valbenazine?

[PMID: 25809133]
The chronic use and high dosing of typical neuroleptics or centrally acting dopamine receptor blocking antiemetics predispose patients to the onset of tardive syndromes. One particular subtype, tardive dyskinesia, is characterized by rapid, repetitive, stereotypic, involuntary movements of the face, limbs or trunk. The inhibition of the vesicular monoamine transporter system, using tetrabenazine therapy, improves the severity of tardive dyskinesia. But there are also drawbacks to tetrabenazine treatment, such as a fluctuating response and the need for frequent intake due to its rapid metabolism. Clinical research on the potentially more efficacious and easier to use tetrabenazine analogs is already under way. One of them is valbenazine, the purified parent drug of the (+)-Î±-isomer of tetrabenazine. The FDA lowered approval hurdles for valbenazine due to a successful Phase II trial, which showed a distinctive improvement in tardive dyskinesia symptoms during valbenazine administration. This resurgence in the clinical research of tardive syndrome therapy is most welcome. This author notes that the putative long-term side effects of valbenazine should carefully be investigated in the future via naturalistic observational trials. Furthermore, valbenazine may also support the onset of symptoms, such as Parkinsonism and depression, with chronic administration, as it, to a certain extent, shares the mode of action of tetrabenazine.

Abnormal involuntary movements often improve in response to anti-dopaminergic drugs. In contrast to classic neuroleptics that block dopamine receptors, drugs that deplete presynaptic dopamine by blocking vesicular monoamine transporter type 2 (VMAT2) seem to be safer and have little or no risk of tardive dyskinesia. This is one reason why there has been a recent emergence of novel VMAT2 inhibitors. Areas covered: Since the approval of tetrabenazine, the classic VMAT2 inhibitor, in the treatment of chorea associated with Huntington disease (HD), other VMAT2 inhibitors (e.g. deutetrabenazine and valbenazine) have been studied in the treatment of HD-related chorea, tardive dyskinesia and tics associated with Tourette syndrome. This review, based largely on a detailed search of PubMed, will summarize the pharmacology and clinical experience with the various VMAT2 inhibitors. Expert commentary: Because of differences in pharmacology and pharmacokinetics these new VMAT2 inhibitors promise to be at least as effective as tetrabenazine but with a lower risk of adverse effects, such as sedation, insomnia, depression, parkinsonism, and akathisia.
