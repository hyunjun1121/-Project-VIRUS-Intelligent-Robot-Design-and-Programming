IDEAL_ANSWER:
- Tafazzin is a mitochondrial phospholipid transacylase, and its mutations cause Barth syndrome (BTHS)
- Tafazzin, a mitochondrial acyltransferase encoded by a gene of the same name, plays an important role in cardiolipin side chain remodeling. Studies have shown that mutation-induced dysfunction of tafazzin reduces cardiolipin content, impairs mitochondrial function, and causes dilated cardiomyopathy in Barth syndrome (BTHS).

EXACT_ANSWER:
- Tafazzin (TAZ) gene
