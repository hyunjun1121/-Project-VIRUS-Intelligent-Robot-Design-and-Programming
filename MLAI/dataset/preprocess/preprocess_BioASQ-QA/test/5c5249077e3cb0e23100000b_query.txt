Glaucoma is an ocular disease characterized by distinctive changes in the optic nerve head (ONH) and visual field. Glaucoma can strike without symptoms and causes blindness if it remains without treatment. Therefore, early disease detection is important so that treatment can be initiated and blindness prevented. In this context, important advances in technology for non-invasive imaging of the eye have been made providing quantitative tools to measure structural changes in ONH topography, an essential element for glaucoma detection and monitoring. 3D spectral domain optical coherence tomography (SD-OCT), an optical imaging technique, has been commonly used to discriminate glaucomatous from healthy subjects. In this paper, we present a new framework for detection of glaucoma progression using 3D SD-OCT images. In contrast to previous works that the retinal nerve fiber layer (RNFL) thickness measurement provided by commercially available spectral-domain optical coherence tomograph, we consider the whole 3D volume for change detection. To integrate a priori knowledge and in particular the spatial voxel dependency in the change detection map, we propose the use of the Markov Random Field to handle a such dependency. To accommodate the presence of false positive detection, the estimated change detection map is then used to classify a 3D SDOCT image into the "non-progressing" and "progressing" glaucoma classes, based on a fuzzy logic classifier. We compared the diagnostic performance of the proposed framework to existing methods of progression detection.

To evaluate the ability of new Swept source (SS) optical coherence tomography (OCT) technology to detect changes in retinal and choroidal thickness in patients with Parkinson's disease (PD). Observational case-control cross sectional study, developed from January to May 2016. In total, 50 eyes from 50 patients diagnosed with PD and 54 eyes of 54 healthy controls underwent retinal and choroidal assessment using SS DRI Triton OCT (Topcon), using the 3D Wide protocol. Total macular thickness and peripapillary data (retinal, ganglion cell layer [GCL+, GCL++] and retinal nerve fiber layer [RNFL] thickness) were analyzed. Macular and peripapillary choroidal thickness was evaluated (Figure 1). Significant peripapillary retinal thinning was observed in PD patients in total average (p = 0.017), in the nasal (p = 0.038) and temporal (p = 0.004) quadrants and in superotemporal (p = 0.004), nasal (p = 0.039), inferotemporal (p = 0.019), and temporal (p = 0.003) sectors. RNFL and GCL ++ thickness showed a significant reduction in the inferotemporal sector (p = 0.026 and 0.009, respectively). No differences were observed in macular retinal thickness between controls and patients. Choroidal thickness was found to have increased in all sectors in PD patients compared with controls, both in the macular (inner nasal, p = 0.015; inner inferior, p = 0.030; outer nasal, p = 0.012; outer inferior, p = 0.049) and the peripapillary area (total thickness, p = 0.011; nasal, p = 0.025; inferior, p = 0.007; temporal, p = 0.003; inferotemporal, p = 0.003; inferonasal, p = 0.016) Conclusion: New SS technology for OCT devices detects retinal thinning in PD patients, providing increased depth analysis of the choroid in these patients. The choroid in PD may present increased thickness compared to healthy individuals; however, more studies and histological analysis are needed to corroborate our findings.

To compare the effect of elevated intraocular pressure (IOP) on retinal capillary filling in elderly vs adult rats using optical coherence tomography angiography (OCTA). The IOP of elderly (24-month-old, N=12) and adult (6-8month-old, N=10) Brown Norway rats was elevated in 10mmHg increments from 10 to 100mmHg. At each IOP level, 3D OCT data were captured using an optical microangiography (OMAG) scanning protocol and then post-processed to obtain both structural and vascular images. Mean arterial blood pressure (MAP), respiratory rate, pulse and blood oxygen saturation were monitored non-invasively throughout each experiment. Ocular perfusion pressure (OPP) was calculated as the difference between MAP for each animal and IOP at each level. The capillary filling index (CFI), defined as the ratio of area occupied by functional capillary vessels to the total scan area but excluding relatively large vessels of >30μm, was calculated at each IOP level and analyzed using the OCTA angiograms. Relative CFI vs IOP was plotted for the group means. CFI vs OPP was plotted for every animal in each group and data from all animals were combined in a CFI vs OPP scatter plot comparing the two groups. The MAP in adult animals was 108±5mmHg (mean±SD), whereas this value in the elderly was 99±5mmHg. All other physiologic parameters for both age groups were uniform and stable. In elderly animals, significant reduction of the CFI was first noted at IOP 40mmHg, as opposed to 60mmHg in adult animals. Individual assessment of CFI as a function of OPP for adult animals revealed a consistent plateau until OPP reached between 40 and 60mmHg. Elderly individuals demonstrated greater variability, with many showing a beginning of gradual deterioration of CFI at an OPP as high as 80mmHg. Overall comparison of CFI vs OPP between the two groups was not statistically significant. Compared to adults, some, but not all, elderly animals demonstrate a more rapid deterioration of CFI vs OPP. This suggests a reduced autoregulatory capacity that may contribute to increased glaucoma susceptibility in some older individuals. This variability must be considered when studying the relationship between IOP, ocular perfusion and glaucoma in elderly animal models.

Three dimensional (3D) ophthalmic imaging using optical coherence tomography (OCT) has revolutionized assessment of the eye, the retina in particular. Recent technological improvements have made the acquisition of 3D-OCT datasets feasible. However, while volumetric data can improve disease diagnosis and follow-up, novel image analysis techniques are now necessary in order to process the dense 3D-OCT dataset. Fundamental software improvements include methods for correcting subject eye motion, segmenting structures or volumes of interest, extracting relevant data post hoc and signal averaging to improve delineation of retinal layers. In addition, innovative methods for image display, such as C-mode sectioning, provide a unique viewing perspective and may improve interpretation of OCT images of pathologic structures. While all of these methods are being developed, most remain in an immature state. This review describes the current status of 3D-OCT scanning and interpretation, and discusses the need for standardization of clinical protocols as well as the potential benefits of 3D-OCT scanning that could come when software methods for fully exploiting these rich datasets are available clinically. The implications of new image analysis approaches include improved reproducibility of measurements garnered from 3D-OCT, which may then help improve disease discrimination and progression detection. In addition, 3D-OCT offers the potential for preoperative surgical planning and intraoperative surgical guidance.

BACKGROUND This study analyzed the macular 3D-OCT images of Vogt-Koyanagi-Harada disease (VKH) in uveitis, explored the characteristics of 3D-OCT images of the macular region of VKH, and assessed which characteristics contribute most to VKH diagnosis. MATERIAL AND METHODS The 3D-OCT examination of 25 cases of VKH was performed on the macular area, and the image characteristics were analyzed. RESULTS Our study included a total of 50 eyes from 25 cases of VKH patients, 10 males and 15 females, aged 17 to 64 years, mean (39.44±11.60) years old. According to OCT B-scan images, 49 (98%) eyes had ERD, 49 (98%) eyes had nerve retinal edema, 36 (72%) eyes had endometrium-like structure (including cysts), 5 (10%) eyes had RPE folds, 35 (70%) eyes had changes in the internal septum, 49 (98%) eyes had RPE monolayer structure outside the ERD region. In ILM-RPE thickness, 49 (98%) eyes had retinal irregular thickening and 31 (62%) eyes had radial stripe changes. In ILM contour figure, 50 eyes (100%) showed exceptional uplift, 5 (10%) eyes had small focal uplift for PED on the RPE surface, and 48 (96%) eyes had wavy ups and downs. CONCLUSIONS In OCT B-scan imaging, the ERT, retinal edema of the retina, and the RPE monolayer structure outside the range are most likely to occur in VKH. The ILM-RPE thickness chart in 3D reconstruction showed irregular thickening of the retina. The ILM contour graph showed abnormal uplift, and RPE surface wavy ups and downs in VKH most likely to occur.

Glaucoma is a chronic neurodegenerative disease characterized by loss of retinal ganglion cells, resulting in distinctive changes in the optic nerve head (ONH) and retinal nerve fiber layer (RNFL). Important advances in technology for non-invasive imaging of the eye have been made providing quantitative tools to measure structural changes in ONH topography, a crucial step in diagnosing and monitoring glaucoma. 3D spectral domain optical coherence tomography (SD-OCT), an optical imaging technique, has been commonly used to discriminate glaucomatous from healthy subjects. In this paper, we present a new approach for locating the Bruch's membrane opening BMO and then estimating the optic disc size and rim area of 3D Spectralis SD-OCT images. To deal with the overlapping of the Bruch's membrane BM layer and the border tissue of Elschnig due to the poor image resolution, we propose the use of image deconvolution approach to separate these layers. To estimate the optic disc size and rim area, we propose the use of a new regression method based on the artificial neural network principal component analysis (ANN-PCA), which allows us to model irregularity in the BMO estimation due to scan shifts and/or poor image quality. The diagnostic accuracy of rim area, and rim to disc area ratio is compared to the diagnostic accuracy of global RNFL thickness measurements provided by two commercially available SD-OCT devices using receiver operating characteristic curve analyses.

Optical coherence tomography is used routinely in management of diabetic eye disease but has not been evaluated in Australian outreach settings for screening programmes. The study aims to evaluate the use of optical coherence tomography combined with a fundus camera compared with a fundus camera only in a telehealth diabetic retinopathy screening programme for Aboriginal Australians. Retrospective comparative study was used. The study included patients with diabetes at two Aboriginal Health Services. An intervention group was studied in 2015 using a Topcon 3D optical coherence tomography-1 Maestro combined with optical coherence tomography/fundus camera. A control group was studied in 2014 using a DRS non-mydriatic fundus camera. Fundus photographs were emailed to trained retinal graders for review. Optical coherence tomography scans were graded by ophthalmologists via remote TeamViewer access. Referral rates to an eye health professional and the rate of inadequate photographs. Two hundred and twenty-two patients were included, with 80 in the control group and 142 in the intervention group. There was a significantly higher rate of inadequate fundus photographs in the intervention group (31.0% vs. 13.8%). Although there was a higher rate of referral to an eye health professional in the intervention group (39.6% vs. 30.0%), this was not significant. Diabetic retinopathy and maculopathy was evident in 32.3% and 12.0% of adequate fundus photographs, respectively. Diabetic macular oedema was present in 3.6% of optical coherence tomography scans. The combined optical coherence tomography fundus camera provided no advantage for diabetic retinopathy screening compared with fundus photography in an Australian programme. The rate of referral to an eye health professional was not reduced with a higher rate of inadequate fundus photographs.
