We have investigated depth-resolved cellular structures of unmodified fresh human scalp hairs with ultrahigh-resolution full-field optical coherence tomography (FF-OCT). The Linnik-type white light interference microscope has been home-implemented to observe the micro-internal layers of human hairs in their natural environment. In hair shafts, FF-OCT has qualitatively revealed the cellular hair compartments of cuticle and cortex layers involved in keratin filaments and melanin granules. No significant difference between black and white hair shafts was observed except for absence of only the melanin granules in the white hair, reflecting that the density of the melanin granules directly affects the hair color. Anatomical description of plucked hair bulbs was also obtained with the FF-OCT in three-dimensions. We expect this approach will be useful for evaluating cellular alteration of natural hairs on cosmetic assessment or diagnosis of hair diseases.

In simple epithelia, such as living epithelial pancreatic cancer cells (Panc-1), unusual amounts of keratin filaments can be found, which makes these cells an ideal model system to study the role of keratin for cell mechanical properties. In this work, the elastic moduli of Panc-1 cells and their extracted in-situ subcellular keratin intermediate filament network are determined and compared with each other. For this, the living adherent cells and their extracted keratin network were probed with local quasistatic indentation testing during large deformations using the Atomic Force Microscope (AFM). We determined the elastic modulus of the skeletonized but structurally intact keratin network to be in the order of 10 Pa, while the living cell elastic modulus ranged from 100 to 500 Pa. By removing microfilaments, microtubules, membranes and soluble cytoplasmic components during keratin network extraction, we excluded effects caused by crosslinking with other filamentous fibers and from the viscosity of the cytoplasm. Thus, the determined elastic modulus equals the actual elastic modulus inherent to such a keratin filamentous network. In our assessment of the effective mechanical contribution of the architecturally intact, skeletonized keratin network to living cell mechanics, we come to the conclusion that it plays only a very limited role. Evidently, the quantitative dominance of keratin in these cells does not reflect a strong influence on determining the cell's elastic modulus. Instead, keratin like other filamentous structures in the cell's scaffolding, e.g., F-actin and microtubuli, is one part of a greater whole.

FasR stimulation by Fas ligand leads to rapid formation of FasR microaggregates, which become signaling protein oligomerization transduction structures (SPOTS), through interactions with actin and ezrin, a structural step that triggers death-inducing signaling complex formation, in association with procaspase-8 activation. In some cells, designated as type I, caspase 8 directly activates effector caspases, whereas in others, known as type II, the caspase-mediated death signaling is amplified through mitochondria. Keratins are the intermediate filament (IF) proteins of epithelial cells, expressed as pairs in a lineage/differentiation manner. Hepatocyte IFs are made solely of keratins 8/18 (K8/K18), the hallmark of all simple epithelia. We have shown recently that in comparison to type II wild-type (WT) mouse hepatocytes, the absence of K8/K18 IFs in K8-null hepatocytes leads to more efficient FasR-mediated apoptosis, in link with a type II/type I-like switch in FasR-death signaling. Here, we demonstrate that the apoptotic process occurring in type I-like K8-null hepatocytes is associated with accelerated SPOTS elaboration at surface membrane, along with manifestation of FasR cap formation and internalization. In addition, the lipid raft organization is altered in K8-null hepatocytes. While lipid raft inhibition impairs SPOTS formation in both WT and K8-null hepatocytes, the absence of K8/K18 IFs in the latter sensitizes SPOTS to actin de-polymerization, and perturbs ezrin compartmentalization. Overall, the results indicate that the K8/K18 IF loss in hepatocytes alters the initial FasR activation steps through perturbation of ezrin/actin interplay and lipid raft organization, which leads to a type II/type I switch in FasR-death signaling.

In breast cancer the development of metastasis is a major turning point in the treatment and outcome of the disease. Throughout tumour development, and especially in the development of metastasis, epithelial mesenchymal transition takes place. During this transformation into a mesenchymal phenotype, the tumour cells undergo a series of structural changes. The loss of structural integrity and adoption of mesenchymal filaments enables cells to detach from the epithelial cell layer and metastasise. Keratins form the intermediate filaments of the cytoskeleton and provide scaffold structures within cells. During cancer progression the intermediate filaments are reorganised, and dramatic changes are seen in their protein components. Keratins K8, K18, K19 and vimentin are intermediate filament proteins with altered expression profiles during tumour development. We have used in vivo and in vitro models to analyse changes in intermediate filament proteins. Antibody-based methods were used to study K8 levels and proteomic analysis to profile the protein content of metastatic breast cancer cell variants. K8 expression declines as human breast tumours progress into an invasive phenotype. Analysis of IF proteins indicated altered expression profiles of K8, K18, K19 and vimentin, with K8, K18, K19 expressed in high levels in the T47D and MCF-7 cell lines, whereas the highly metastatic cell lines expressed lower levels of K8 and K18 and no detectable K19. Vimentin showed reverse expression profile with T47D and MCF-7 cells having no detectable vimentin expression whereas the highly metastatic MDA-MB-231 and MDA-MB-436 showed high levels. Analysis of acetylation status using specific antibodies suggested acetylation occurred within the central coiled domain in the MCF-7 and T47D cells. Inhibition of tumour growth by tissue factor (TF) shRNA resulted in a dramatic re-elevation of expression of K8 in xenographs of the highly metastatic MDA-MB-436 line. Intermediate filament expression alters during epithelial mesenchymal transition. Identified post translational modifications may play a role in alterations seen in the organisation, solubility and stability of these filaments. Epithelial mesenchymal transition can be reversed and an epithelial phenotype re-established.

Keratin is a protein in the intermediate filament family and the key component of hair, nail, and skin. Here we report a bottom-up atomistic model of the keratin dimer, using the complete human keratin type k35 and k85 amino acid sequence. A detailed analysis of geometric and mechanical properties through full-atomistic simulation with validation against experimental results is presented. We introduce disulfide cross-links in a keratin tetramer and compare the mechanical behavior of the disulfide bonded systems with a system without disulfide bonds. Disulfide bond results in a higher strength (20% increase) and toughness (49% increase), but the system loses α-helical structures under loading, suggesting that disulfide bonds play a significant role in achieving the characteristic mechanical properties of trichocyte α-keratin. Our study provides general insight into the effect of disulfide cross-link on mechanical properties. Moreover, the availability of an atomistic model of this protein opens the possibility to study the mechanical properties of hair fibrils and other fibers from a bottom-up perspective.

An intact keratin 5/keratin 14 intermediate filament cytoskeleton is vital for the integrity of basal keratinocytes and for the development and maintenance of epidermal structures. In patients with epidermolysis bullosa simplex Dowling-Meara (EBS-DM), heterozygous mutations in the keratin 14 gene in keratinocytes cause a cytoskeletal collapse leading to fragile cells susceptible to cellular stress. The primary aim of this work was to extend analysis of differentially expressed genes in an EBS-DM model cell line to obtain insights into the molecular consequences resulting from the keratin 14 mutation. In a first step, suppression subtractive hybridization (SSH), a powerful technology to enrich for differentially expressed genes, was used to identify genes whose up-regulation may be a direct or indirect result of the keratin 14 mutation, R125P. We discovered 55 candidate genes (SSH genes) that were further analysed by RTq-PCR. Of the 55 SSH genes, 14 (25.45%) were found to be congruently up-regulated. Bioinformatic analysis revealed significant enrichment of genes regulating epidermal development, migration, apoptosis and wound healing.

Re-modeling of epithelial tissues requires that the cells in the tissue rearrange their adhesive contacts in order to allow cells to migrate relative to neighboring cells. Desmosomes are prominent adhesive structures found in a variety of epithelial tissues that are believed to inhibit cell migration and invasion. Mechanisms regulating desmosome assembly and stability in migrating cells are largely unknown. In this study we established a cell culture model to examine the fate of desmosomal components during scratch wound migration. Desmosomes are rapidly assembled between epithelial cells at the lateral edges of migrating cells and structures are transported in a retrograde fashion while the structures become larger and mature. Desmosome assembly and dynamics in this system are dependent on the actin cytoskeleton prior to being associated with the keratin intermediate filament cytoskeleton. These studies extend our understanding of desmosome assembly and provide a system to examine desmosome assembly and dynamics during epithelial cell migration.

The stratum corneum (SC) is the outermost region of the epidermis and plays key roles in cutaneous barrier function in mammals. The SC is composed of 'bricks', represented by flattened, protein-enriched corneocytes, and 'mortar', represented by intercellular lipid-enriched layers. As a result of this 'bricks and mortar' structure, the SC can be considered as a 'rampart' that encloses water and solutes essential for physiological homeostasis and that protects mammals from physical, chemical and biological assaults. The corneocyte cytoskeleton contains tight bundles of keratin intermediate filaments aggregated with filaggrin monomers, which are subsequently degraded into natural moisturizing compounds by various proteases, including caspase 14. A cornified cell envelope is formed on the inner surface of the corneocyte plasma membrane by transglutaminase-catalysed cross-linking of involucrin and loricrin. Ceramides form a lipid envelope by covalently binding to the cornified cell envelope, and extracellular lamellar lipids play an important role in permeability barrier function. Corneodesmosomes are the main adhesive structures in the SC and are degraded by certain serine proteases, such as kallikreins, during desquamation. The roles of the different SC components, including the structural proteins in corneocytes, extracellular lipids and some proteins associated with lipid metabolism, have been investigated in genetically engineered mice and in naturally occurring hereditary skin diseases, such as ichthyosis, ichthyosis syndrome and atopic dermatitis in humans, cattle and dogs.

Maintaining proper cell-cell adhesion in the intestine is essential for tissue homeostasis and barrier function. This adhesion is thought to be mediated by cell adhesion structures, including tight junctions, adherens junctions, and desmosomes, which concentrate in the apical junctional region. While clear roles for adherens and tight junctions have been established in simple epithelia, the function of desmosomes has not been addressed. In stratified epithelia, desmosomes impart mechanical strength to tissues by organizing and anchoring the keratin filament network. In this paper, we report that the desmosomal protein desmoplakin (DP) is not essential for cell adhesion in the intestinal epithelium. Surprisingly, when DP is lacking, keratin filament localization is also unperturbed, although keratin filaments no longer anchor at desmosomes. Unexpectedly, DP is important for proper microvillus structure. Our study highlights the tissue-specific functions of desmosomes and reveals that the canonical functions for these structures are not conserved in simple epithelium.

The cellular cytoskeleton is composed of three fibrillar systems, namely actin microfilaments, microtubules and intermediate filaments (IFs). It not only is a structural system, which mediates functional compartmentalization, but also contributes to many cellular processes such as transport, mitosis, secretion, formation of cell extensions, intercellular communication and apoptosis. In this study, we have examined the distribution of four groups of IFs [cytokeratins (CKs), vimentin, desmin and lamins] in the somatic and germinal cells of the bovine ovary using RT-PCR and immunohistochemical techniques. Using RT-PCR, specific transcripts for all intermediate proteins studied (CK8, CK18, desmin, vimentin, lamin A/C and lamin B1) were detected. A characteristic immunohistochemical staining pattern was observed for the different IFs within the ovary. In this study, we used antibodies against type I CK (acidic CKs: CK14, CK18 and CK19) and type II CK (basic CKs: CK5 and CK8). Among these, only antibodies against CK18 gave a characteristic pattern of immunostaining in the ovary, which included the surface epithelium, the follicle cells, the endothelium of blood vessels and rete ovarii. Antibodies against all other CKs resulted in a weak staining of a limited number of cellular structures (CK5 and CK19) or were completely negative (CK8 and CK14, apart from the surface epithelium). Vimentin antibodies resulted occasionally in a weak staining of the granulosa cells of primary and secondary follicles. In late secondary follicles, the basal and the most apical follicle cells contacting the zona pellucida usually showed a marked immunostaining for vimentin. In antral follicles, three different immunostaining patterns for vimentin were observed. Desmin immunostaining was confined to the smooth muscle cells of blood vessels. Although mRNA for lamin A/C and lamin B1 could be demonstrated using RT-PCR, no immunostaining was found for lamins, neither in the follicle cells nor in the oocytes.

Desmosomes are cell-cell adhesion structures that integrate cytoskeletal networks. In addition to binding intermediate filaments, the desmosomal protein desmoplakin (DP) regulates microtubule reorganization in the epidermis. In this paper, we identify a specific subset of centrosomal proteins that are recruited to the cell cortex by DP upon epidermal differentiation. These include Lis1 and Ndel1, which are centrosomal proteins that regulate microtubule organization and anchoring in other cell types. This recruitment was mediated by a region of DP specific to a single isoform, DPI. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the epidermal-specific loss of Lis1 results in dramatic defects in microtubule reorganization. Lis1 ablation also causes desmosomal defects, characterized by decreased levels of desmosomal components, decreased attachment of keratin filaments, and increased turnover of desmosomal proteins at the cell cortex. This contributes to loss of epidermal barrier activity, resulting in completely penetrant perinatal lethality. This work reveals essential desmosome-associated components that control cortical microtubule organization and unexpected roles for centrosomal proteins in epidermal function.

The skin is essential for survival and protects our body against biological attacks, physical stress, chemical injury, water loss, ultraviolet radiation and immunological impairment. The epidermal barrier constitutes the primordial frontline of this defense established during terminal differentiation. During this complex process proliferating basal keratinocytes become suprabasally mitotically inactive and move through four epidermal layers (basal, spinous, granular and layer, stratum corneum) constantly adapting to the needs of the respective cell layer. As a result, squamous keratinocytes contain polymerized keratin intermediate filament bundles and a water-retaining matrix surrounded by the cross-linked cornified cell envelope (CE) with ceramide lipids attached on the outer surface. These cells are concomitantly insulated by intercellular lipid lamellae and hold together by corneodesmosmes. Many proteins essential for epidermal differentiation are encoded by genes clustered on chromosomal human region 1q21. These genes constitute the 'epidermal differentiation complex' (EDC), which is divided on the basis of common gene and protein structures, in three gene families: (i) CE precursors, (ii) S100A and (iii) S100 fused genes. EDC protein expression is regulated in a gene and tissue-specific manner by a pool of transcription factors. Among them, Klf4, Grhl3 and Arnt are essential, and their deletion in mice is lethal. The importance of the EDC is further reflected by human diseases: FLG mutations are the strongest risk factor for atopic dermatitis (AD) and for AD-associated asthma, and faulty CE formation caused by TG1 deficiency causes life-threatening lamellar ichthyosis. Here, we review the EDC genes and the progress in this field.
