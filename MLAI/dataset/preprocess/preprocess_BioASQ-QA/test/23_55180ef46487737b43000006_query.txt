What is the typical rash associated with gluten ?

[PMID: 6742871]
Fifty seven children with dermatitis herpetiformis, 18 from Finland and 39 from Hungary, were studied. Diagnostic criteria included the finding of granular IgA deposits in the skin of all patients. The mean age at onset of the rash was 7 X 2 years and favoured sites were the elbows, knees, and buttocks. Symptoms suggesting small intestinal disease were rare but in 35 (61%) of the children subtotal villous atrophy and in 16 (28%) partial villous atrophy were found on jejunal biopsy. Eighteen children underwent a second biopsy after a mean of 21 months on a gluten free diet; villous height was found to be increased and the intraepithelial lymphocyte count decreased in all these patients. Gluten challenge caused a reversal in the two children who underwent a third biopsy. The effect of the gluten free diet on the rash was examined in Finnish children by observing the daily requirements of dapsone, a drug used to control the rash at the beginning of the diet. Eight (67%) of the 12 children were able to stop taking dapsone after a mean of 11 months on the diet and all three patients treated with diet alone became asymptomatic after three to 6 months on the diet. These results confirm that most children with dermatitis herpetiformis have jejunal villous atrophy, though they rarely have gastrointestinal symptoms. The central role of gluten in childhood dermatitis herpetiformis is evidenced by the fact that a gluten free diet helps the damaged jejunal mucosa to recover and controls the rash even in those children who do not have an abnormal jejunal biopsy.

Dermatitis herpetiformis is an autoimmune blistering disease that appears as a cutaneous manifestation of gluten intolerance. It is one of a group of disorders that have gluten sensitivity in common, including celiac disease and gluten ataxia. Patients with dermatitis herpetiformis present with a pruritic papulovesicular rash on extensor surfaces and on the buttocks. Immunological studies demonstrate the presence of specific immunoglobulin (Ig) A anti-endomysial and anti-transglutaminase antibodies. The finding of granular deposits of IgA along the dermal-epidermal junction is pathognomonic of dermatitis herpetiformis. Treatment of dermatitis herpetiformis is based on a life-long, strict gluten-free diet, which improves all clinical aspects of gluten sensitivity, and dapsone, a drug that is only effective for the skin manifestations.

Dermatitis herpetiformis (DH) is an autoimmune blistering skin disorder that is associated with gluten sensitivity. It presents as a papulovesicular rash and is often associated with enteropathy. The rash resolves when the patient is placed on a gluten-free diet and/or dapsone. DH, as well as celiac disease, is tightly associated with DQ2 and DQ8. A novel mouse model for DH is described that utilizes the NOD background and the HLA-DQ8 transgene. The addition of DQ8 contributes sensitivity to gliadin, and the addition of the NOD background contributes to autoimmunity and pathogenesis. Fifteen NOD DQ8+ mice of 90 that were sensitized to gluten developed blistering pathology similar to that seen in DH. Neutrophil infiltration of the dermis, deposition of IgA at the dermal-epidermal junction, and a complete reversal of the blistering phenomenon with the administration of a gluten-free diet with or without dapsone were observed. None of the 3 blistering mice examined had small-bowel pathology. This animal model of DH will be useful to determine the specificity of the IgA deposits, as well as the pathogenic mechanisms that occur in the skin as a result of gluten ingestion.

Dermatitis herpetiformis (DH) is a chronic papulovesicular immune-mediated disorder associated with gluten-sensitive enteropathy. We report eight cases in which DH appeared many years after celiac disease (CD) in child. The diagnosis of CD was based on histological features of total or subtotal villous atrophy, full remission after withdrawal of gluten from the diet, and eventually circulating antibodies (IgA gliadin, antireticulin and antiendomysium) at the time of diagnosis and their disappearance under gluten-free diet. The diagnosis of DH was made from clinical findings, histological examination of the involved skin and direct immunofluorescence microscopy of normal or perilesional skin. HLA class II typing was performed in five patients. DRB1, DQA1, DQB1 and DBP1 alleles were studied. DH appeared between 3 and 22 years after the initial diagnosis of CD. Five patients did not show at that time any digestive symptoms. In three cases, a break in the gluten-free diet or a recent revival of the normal diet preceded the rash. In only one case, DH appeared while the patient was under gluten-free diet. In three patients, the rash appeared many years after the gluten-free diet had been stopped. Phenotype DR3 and/or DR7 of the celiac disease could be found in four of the five patients studied; three of them were found to bear DQW2. The DR2 allele was not found in any of the five tested patients. These eight cases illustrate the absence of precise nosological barrier between gluten-sensitive enteropathy of the DH and that observed in CD. The presence of the DR7 allele, and especially the absence of the DR2 allele, could explain the particularly severe and symptomatic course of the enteropathy in these patients. The delay in the appearance of DH, after a very variable period of normal diet, could correspond to the necessary time for progressive accumulation of IgA (or immune complex IgA-gluten) in the skin after a digestive sensitization to gluten. The preventive role of gluten-free diet is thus probable. CD and DH likely correspond to two different stages of the same disease, thus requiring a prolonged follow-up of both digestive and skin tissues. Long-term eviction of gluten to prevent eventual DH must be balanced with the demand and the cost of such a diet.

Dermatitis herpetiformis (DH) is a specific dermatological manifestation of coeliac disease and 80% of DH patients have gluten sensitive enteropathy manifested by crypt hyperplasia and villous atrophy. Matrix degradation mediated by collagenase 1 (MMP-1) and stromelysin 1 (MMP-3) has previously been implicated in the pathobiology of coeliac intestine and cutaneous DH blisters. To study expression of stromelysin 2, metalloelastase, collagenase 3, and matrilysin in the intestine and skin of DH patients. In situ hybridisation using 35S labelled cRNA probes was performed on duodenal biopsies of 15 DH patients, three samples each of control duodenal or jejunal mucosa, fetal ileal explants, lesional DH skin, and 19 serial biopsies of experimental DH blisters. Immunostaining was used to examine type IV collagen, macrophages (CD68), and 92 kDa gelatinase (MMP-9) in the specimens. Metalloelastase (MMP-12) was abundantly expressed by subepithelial macrophages in both coeliac intestine and spontaneous and induced DH rash. It was also upregulated in the experimental model of coeliac disease (staphylococcal endotoxin B stimulated fetal explants). The only other MMP detected was MMP-9 which did not colocalise with MMP-12. Upregulation of metalloelastase is associated with T cell mediated immune responses both in the intestine and skin. In addition to modulating macrophage migration, it may contribute to degradation of proteoglycans or basement membrane components in the subepithelial mucosa.

Dermatitis herpetiformis is characterised by granular IgA precipitates in the papillary dermis. In contrast to other autoimmune blistering diseases, where tissue-deposited and circulating autoantibodies recognise the same target within the skin, in dermatitis herpetiformis a serum IgA reacting with a component of the healthy papillary dermis has not been detected. Recently, the antigenic specificity of pathognomic skin-bound IgA has been clarified: the immune precipitates contain epidermal transglutaminase, an enzyme not previously detected in the papillary region of normal skin. Furthermore, serum IgA in dermatitis herpetiformis has been found to bind epidermal transglutaminase. These findings may relate to the fact, that dermatitis herpetiformis is associated with gluten sensitive enteropathy, coeliac disease, which is characterised by IgA type autoantibodies to a closely related enzyme, tissue transglutaminase. The two transglutaminases are highly homologous, and therefore, cross reactivity of the two antibodies might explain why patients with gluten sensitive enteropathy, with or without skin disease, generally have serum autoantibodies to both enzymes. There is growing evidence that dermatitis herpetiformis should be considered as the skin manifestation of gluten sensitivity developing in those patients with mild coeliac disease, who produce epidermal transglutaminase autoantibodies of high avidity and affinity. Both the skin and the small bowel diseases are gluten dependent and are strongly associated with HLA DQ with no genetic differences to explain the two phenotypes. The question should be asked whether the rash in dermatitis herpetiformis is a classic autoimmune blistering disease or whether it has an immune complex basis, which is the most likely alternative.

A study was undertaken to determine whether the skin eruption of linear IgA disease (LAD) was gluten dependent. Six patients with LAD were treated with a gluten free diet (GFD) for an average period of 33 months (range 19-48). Although one patient with LAD had an enteropathy which was clearly gluten sensitive, there was no convincing evidence that the rash of any of the patients responded to a GFD. Four of the six patients showed no significant alteration in their drug requirements. The remaining 2 patients showed a fall in minimum drug requirement but there was no increase after gluten challenge indicating that they were entering spontaneous remission. This contrasts to the situation in dermatitis herpetiformis, where both the rash and the enteropathy are gluten dependent. These data add further to the evidence that LAD and dermatitis herpetiformis are separate entities.

People with gluten sensitivity should avoid foods containing wheat, rye, and barley, but there has been debate about whether they should avoid oats. Although patients with celiac disease have recently been shown to tolerate oats, less is known about the effects of oats on patients with dermatitis herpetiformis. We studied seven men and three women (mean age, 58 years) with biopsy-confirmed dermatitis herpetiformis. They had followed a strict gluten-free diet for a mean of 15.8 years, which controlled their rash and enteropathy. The patients added oats that were not contaminated with gluten to their diets for 12 weeks (mean [+/-SD] daily intake, 62.5+/-10.8 g). None of the patients had any adverse effects. Serologic tests for antigliadin, antireticulin, and antiendomysial antibodies were negative before oats were introduced into the diet and after they were discontinued. Villous architecture remained normal: the mean (+/-SE) ratio of the height of villi to the depth of crypts was 3.59+/-0.11 before the diet and 3.71+/-0.09 afterward (normal, 3 to 5), and the mean enterocyte heights were 31.36+/-0.58 microm and 31.75+/-44 microm, respectively (normal range, 29 to 34). Duodenal intraepithelial lymphocyte counts all remained within normal limits (mean, 13.8+/-1.03 per 100 enterocytes before the diet and 14.2+/-1.2 per 100 enterocytes afterward; normal range, 10 to 30). Dermal IgA showed no significant changes. Patients with dermatitis herpetiformis can include moderate amounts of oats in their gluten-free diets without deleterious effects to the skin or intestine.

This study reports the appearance of IgA-class anti-endomysial antibodies in the serum of 8 out of 12 patients with dermatitis herpetiformis who were challenged with gluten after a number of years of control of the rash with a strict gluten-free diet. Although there was no evidence for the antibodies having any pathogenic role in the rash of dermatitis herpetiformis, their presence may be related to the deterioration in the gluten-sensitive enteropathy.

A life-long gluten-free diet is the treatment of choice for dermatitis herpetiformis, which is considered to be coeliac disease of the skin. To investigate the effects on long-term remission of dermatitis herpetiformis in patients who underwent a gluten challenge and subsequently reintroduced dietary gluten. We studied 38 patients (14 male and 24 female) with biopsy-confirmed dermatitis herpetiformis. They had followed a gluten-free diet for a mean of 8 years, achieving clinical remission and intestinal normalization. The patients were asked to reintroduce gluten in their diet and agreed to undergo skin and intestinal biopsies during the follow-up. Of the 38 patients abandoning a gluten-free diet, 31 reported the onset of rash within an average of 2 months. Seven subjects (three males, mean age 15 years at challenge) experienced no clinical or histological relapses (median follow-up 12 years), and lost IgA immunoglobulin from the skin. The two series of patients differed in terms of age at diagnosis (mean age: 26.6 vs. 6 years), the use of dapsone (one of 31 vs. four of seven) and adherence to the gluten-free diet (strict compliance in 26 of 31 vs. none of seven). Our data suggest that the ingestion of small doses of gluten in childhood and/or the use of an anti-inflammatory drug may modify the immunological response inducing immune tolerance. We report long-term clinical and histological remissions in seven patients with dermatitis herpetiformis after the reintroduction of dietary gluten.

Dermatitis herpetiformis (DH) is a relatively rare skin disorder with an estimated incidence of 1:10,000 in the UK. It is characterized by urticarial plaques and blisters on the elbows, buttocks, and knees, although other sites may also be involved. The eruption tends to be persistent: only 10-15% of patients have spontaneous remission over a 25-year study period. The disease is characterized by the presence of IgA deposits in the upper dermis of uninvolved skin and the diagnosis should not be made in the absence of these deposits. Two-thirds of patients have a small intestinal enteropathy with villous atrophy as seen in coeliac disease (CD). However, the remaining third also show evidence of a gluten sensitivity in the intestine, as judged by increased lymphocytic infiltration of the epithelium. Villous atrophy also ensues after gluten challenge in those patients with previous normal villous architecture. The initial treatment of the rash is with one of the following three drugs, dapsone, sulphapyridine or sulphamethoxypyridazine. However, the rash also clears with gluten withdrawal. It must be stressed, however, that the average time to achieve significant reduction in drug requirements is 6 months and it can be over 2 years before drugs are no longer required. On re-introduction of gluten the eruption recurs. Patients with DH have a high incidence of auto-immune disorders, thyroid disease, pernicious anaemia, and insulin-dependent diabetes, and should be screened for those diseases on a yearly basis. As with coeliac disease there is also an increased incidence of lymphoma and a gluten-free diet appears to protect patients from this complication. The mechanism by which gluten causes the skin lesions has still to be elucidated, but current investigations implicate lymphocytes and cytokines in the pathogenesis. The original hypothesis of an antigen-antibody reaction in the skin with complement activation causing the skin lesions, may not be correct.

Gluten enteropathy is a chronic all-life disease, characterized by typical inflammatory changes of the small bowel mucosa. It is the genetically determined autoimmune disease with permanent intolerance to gluten. Its clinical signs are very heterogeneous and also the severity of intestinal changes varies considerably. It frequently presents with atypical symptoms, as many as 80% of adult patients have no gastrointestinal troubles at all. The present estimated prevalence is 1:200 - 1:250. The diagnosis is based on criteria of the European Society of Paediatric Gastroenterology, Hepatology and Nutrition revised in 1990, above all on the detection of serum antibodies to endomysium and tissue transglutaminase. The five forms are distinguished: classic, subclinical, latent, potential and silent. Coeliac disease and dermatitis herpetiformis are considered to be two identical forms of the gluten enteropathy manifestations. Coeliac disease is frequently associated with other autoimmune diseases--diabetes mellitus, autoimmune thyreoiditis, hepatitis, IgA deficiency. Permanent gluten free diet is the cornerstone of the therapy; untreated gluten enteropathy is a serious illness, considered to be a significant precancerosis.

Dermatitis herpetiformis (DH) is an IgA mediated blistering skin disease characterized by the presence of granular deposits of IgA in papillary dermis. The major significant advances in our understanding of DH have been the demonstration that DH patients also have coeliac diseases (CD) and that the rash is also gluten dependent. As a result, it is now possible to cure patients by gluten withdrawal from the diet. The other major significant finding has been the presence of IgA in the uninvolved, now used as the diagnostic criterion for the disease. Despite the fact that it has been known for over fifty years that gluten causes the enteropathy of CD, and for over thirty years the rash of DH, it is still not known how gluten produces these effects. Future immunological studies may look at ways of inducing tolerance to gluten peptides once the toxic ones have been identified. Vaccination against gluten peptides may also be possible in those affected with gluten sensitive disorders.

Serum IgA class antigliadin antibodies (IgA-AGA) are increased in untreated patients with coeliac disease and dermatitis herpetiformis (DH), and it has been suggested that salivary IgA-AGA measurements could be used as a non-invasive screening test for gluten-sensitive enteropathy. In the present study salivary and serum IgA-AGA were measured by an ELISA test in 10 untreated patients with DH. The results were compared to IgA-AGA levels in nine patients with DH on a long-term gluten-free diet (GFD) and in 20 healthy control subjects on an ordinary diet. The mean serum but not salivary IgA-AGA concentrations were significantly higher in the untreated than in the patients with DH on a long-term GFD. When the 10 untreated patients with DH adhered to a GFD for 3 months, the rash disappeared and the mean serum IgA-AGA decreased to normal levels, but no change was found in the mean salivary IgA-AGA concentration. These results show that serum but not salivary IgA-AGA measurements are suitable for monitoring GFD treatment in patients with DH. The discrepancy between the serum and salivary IgA-AGA concentrations suggests that systemic and salivary IgA-AGA responses are controlled separately.

Recent studies on coeliac disease have shown that oats can be included in a gluten-free diet without adverse effects on the small bowel. The presence of a rash is also a sensitive indicator of gluten ingestion in dermatitis herpetiformis, and this was used to study whether patients with this disease could also tolerate oats. Eleven patients with dermatitis herpetiformis in remission on a gluten-free diet were challenged daily with 50 g oats for six months. Clinical symptoms were recorded, serum samples taken, and skin and small bowel biopsies performed before and after the oat challenge. A control group comprised of 11 patients with dermatitis herpetiformis on a conventional gluten-free diet was also studied. Eight patients challenged with oats remained asymptomatic, two developed a transient rash, and one withdrew because of the appearance of a more persistent but mild rash. Three of the 11 controls also developed a transient rash. IgA endomysial antibodies remained negative in all patients. The small bowel villous architecture, the densities of intraepithelial CD3 and alpha/beta and gamma/delta T cell receptor positive lymphocytes and crypt epithelial cell DR expression remained unaltered during the oat challenge. The results confirm the absence of oat toxicity on the gluten sensitive small bowel mucosa and suggest that the rash in patients with dermatitis herpetiformis is not activated by eating oats.

Gluten-free diets have been used in the treatment of patients with dermatitis herpetiformis in our department since 1967. Of the 212 patients with dermatitis herpetiformis attending between 1967 and 1992, 133 managed to take the diet, and 78 of these achieved complete control of their rash by diet alone. Of the remaining 55 patients taking a gluten-free diet, all but three were taking partial diets; over half of these patients managed to substantially reduce the dose of medication required. Of the 77 patients taking a normal diet, eight entered spontaneous remission, giving a remission rate of 10%; a further two patients who had been taking gluten-free diets were found to have remitted when they resumed normal diets. Loss of IgA from the skin was observed in 10 of 41 (24%) patients taking strict gluten-free diets. These patients had been taking their diets for an average of 13 years (range 5-24 years), and their rash had been controlled by diet alone for an average of 10 years (range 3-16 years). The advantages of a gluten-free diet in the management of patients with dermatitis herpetiformis are: (i) the need for medication is reduced or abolished; (ii) there is resolution of the enteropathy, and (iii) patients experience a feeling of well-being after commencing the diet. Thus, we propose that a gluten-free diet is the most appropriate treatment for patients with dermatitis herpetiformis.

Dermatitis herpetiformis (DH) is an autoimmunity-driven inflammatory blistering dermatosis associated with a gluten-dependent enteropathy. Tissue transglutaminase (tTG) and nonapeptides of gliadin (npG) are considered in its pathomechanism/diagnostics. Here, the diagnostic accuracy of anti-tTG/anti-npG IgA ELISAs in Slavic DH patients with active skin rash was assessed through creating receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves, determining cutoff values, and calculating correlations between levels of anti-tTG/anti-npG IgA in DH, IgA/neutrophil-mediated non-DH patients and healthy persons. Altogether, sera from 80 Slavic individuals were examined. There were negligible differences between cutoff points obtained by the ELISAs manufacturer and those in this study. There were statistically significant correlations between levels of anti-tTG/anti-npG IgA in both DH group and the group of IgA/neutrophil-mediated non-DH dermatoses. There was no such correlation in healthy controls. It seems that IgA autoantibodies to tTG and npG in the IgA/neutrophil-mediated DH are produced in the coordinated way implying their causal relationship.

The incidence of reporting and diagnosis of coeliac disease (CD) in children is increasing with the improvement in sensitivity and specificity of screening markers. This in turn has led to an increasing awareness of gluten-sensitive enteropathy and associated disorders. We report the unusual case of an 8-month-old child presenting to his general practitioner with pruritic skin lesions, subsequently proven to be dermatitis herpetiformis (DH) as the first sign of gluten-sensitive disease. This infant is the youngest child presenting with DH who could be identified from published report dating from 1966 onwards. Dermatitis herpetiformis is the commonest associated pathology of CD, although rare in infancy, it should be considered in any child presenting with failure to thrive and atypical, chronic rash not responding to simple measures.

Dermatitis herpetiformis and coeliac disease are gluten-sensitive diseases that share immunopathological mechanisms. Neurological disorders are reported in both diseases, being more frequent in coeliac disease. Dermatitis herpetiformis is rare in paediatric populations and only sporadic cases with neurological dysfunction are reported. Uncertainty exists as to whether early treatment may stop or reverse neurological symptoms. We describe here the case of a child presenting with a rash and ataxia, diagnosed with dermatitis herpetiformis, in whom neurological symptoms and signs regressed after treatment.

Gluten sensitive enteropathy has various manifestations, of which the two major forms are classical coeliac disease (cCD) and dermatitis herpetiformis (DH). In cCD predominantly the small intestine is affected, whereas in DH also the skin is affected showing typical rash and IgA deposits. The symptoms in both forms are dependent on gluten intake. The factors diversifying these two clinical outcomes are unknown. In the present report we evaluated the role of the major genetic susceptibility locus, HLA DQ, in 25 families, in which both forms of the disease, cCD and DH, occurred in siblings. By using the family-based approach it can be assumed that within each family variation in environmental factors is substantially lower than in the standard case-control setting, and also the problems related to population stratification can be avoided. Results from the Finnish family material with 25 discordant and 85 concordant sib pairs, and from additional case-control material comprising 71 unrelated Hungarian DH and 68 cCD patients, together indicated that the HLA DQ locus did not differ between the two major outcomes of gluten sensitive enteropathy. The non-HLA DR;DQ factors are critical for the different clinical manifestations of gluten sensitivity.

Twenty one children with dermatitis herpetiformis were studied in an attempt to evaluate the response in the skin, in jejunal morphology, and in jejunal immunoglobulin containing cell counts to gluten elimination and subsequent gluten challenge. In all of the 15 patients whose jejunal biopsy was studied after the eventual gluten challenge the jejunal lesion had returned in 2.4 to 28 months. The numbers of IgA- and IgM-containing cells were similarly raised in primary and postchallenge biopsies. In the 13 patients whose skin improved during a gluten free diet and who were challenged with gluten the rash worsened and the dapsone/sulphapyridine requirement increased. The jejunal deterioration was equally marked in the six patients whose gluten challenge was stopped because of an intractable rash as it was in those who completed the preplanned challenge. The specimens of the former, however, had significantly more IgA-containing cells than specimens of the latter. The number of intraepithelial lymphocytes clearly reflected the degree of intestinal damage. IgA-containing cells proved to be the most sensitive indicator of an immune reaction taking place in the gut of these patients. Even in the two children with initially normal or nearly normal jejunal mucosa, the IgA cell counts in the jejunal lamina propria were markedly raised.

Twenty-one patients with dermatitis herpetiformis have been on a gluten free diet regularly followed up for at least one year (mean four years). Eighteen patients had a 'flat' mucosal appearance (grade III), one patient had moderately severe mucosal abnormality (grade II), one patient had mild mucosal abnormality (grade I), and one patient had a normal mucosal appearance (grade O). On the diet, 10 patients had no skin rash and took no dapsone, seven patients controlled the skin rash on a lower dose of dapsone, and four noticed no improvement. There was no correlation between pre-diet jejunal morphology and response of the skin. A repeat jejunal biopsy, on the gluten free diet, was possible in 15 patients. While all those with skin improvement showed some improvement in jejunal morphology, there was no association between the degree of skin improvement and the degree of recovery of the jejunal mucosa.

Dermatitis herpetiformis (DH) is a lifelong, gluten-sensitive, blistering skin disease with pathognomonic immunoglobulin (Ig)A deposits in the papillary dermis. Less than 10% of patients with DH have gastrointestinal symptoms suggestive of coeliac disease, yet they all have gluten-sensitive enteropathy. The rash, too, responds to gluten withdrawal. Therefore, DH provides a unique example of the frequent existence of gastroenterologically 'silent' but dermatologically active coeliac disease. DH and coeliac disease are strictly associated with class II HLA alleles A1*0501 and B1*02 encoding the HLA-DQ2 heterodimer. Coeliac disease segregates in the families of patients with DH, also supporting a shared genetic background. Monozygotic twins, one with DH and the other with coeliac disease, show that environmental, not genetic, factors seem to be responsible for the development of the rash in DH. A clinically silent but immunologically active coeliac disease in the gut could well produce IgA autoantibodies which react also with the connective tissue in the skin. The antigen for deposited IgA and its role, if any, in the blister formation in DH remains, however, to be elucidated.
