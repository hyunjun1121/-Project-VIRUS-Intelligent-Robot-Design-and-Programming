What is another name for acid sphingomyelinase deficiency (ASMD)?

[PMID: 27884455]
Acid sphingomyelinase deficiency (ASMD) is an autosomal recessive disease with a clinical spectrum ranging from a neurovisceral infantile form (Niemann-Pick disease type A) to a chronic visceral form also encountered in adults (Niemann-Pick disease type B, NP-B). Retrospective multicentric analysis of French adult patients with ASMD over the period 1985-March 2015. Clinical, biological, and imaging data were analyzed. Twenty-eight patients (19 males, 9 females) were analyzed. Diagnosis was made before the age of 10 years in 16 cases. Main symptoms at diagnosis were spleen/liver enlargement and interstitial lung disease. Biological abnormalities included: thrombocytopenia (platelet count <150 000/mm<sup>3</sup>) in 24 cases including 4 patients with platelet count <60 000/mm<sup>3</sup>, constantly low high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol, polyclonal hypergammaglobulinemia (n=6), monoclonal gammopathy of unknown significance (n=5), normal prothrombin level discordant with low factor V (n=5), elevated chitotriosidase level (n=11). The diagnosis was confirmed in all cases by deficient acid sphingomyelinase enzyme activity. SMPD1 gene sequencing was performed in 25 cases. The frequent p.R610del mutation was largely predominant, constituting 62% of the non-related alleles. During the follow-up period, three patients died before 50 years of age from cirrhosis, heart failure and lung insufficiency, respectively. ASMD in adulthood (NP-B) associates spleen/liver enlargement and interstitial lung disease. Early diagnosis and appropriate management are essential for reducing the risk of complications, improving quality of life, and avoiding inappropriate procedures such as splenectomy. To date, only symptomatic therapy is available. A phase 2/3 therapeutic trial with IV infusion of recombinant enzyme is on-going.

Acid sphingomyelinase deficiency (ASMd, Niemann-Pick disease A/B) and Niemann-Pick type C disease (NPC) share core clinical symptoms. Initial diagnostic discrimination of these two rare lysosomal storage diseases is thus difficult. As sphingomyelin accumulates in ASMd as well as NPC, lysosphingomyelin (sphingosylphosphorylcholine) and its m/z 509 analog were suggested as biomarkers for both diseases. Herein we present results of simultaneous LC-ESI-MS/MS measurements of lysosphingomyelin and lysosphingomyelin 509 in plasma and dried blood spots (DBS) collected from ASMd and NPC patients and suggest that the plasma but not DBS levels of the two analytes allow differential biochemical screening of ASMd and NPC.

Acid sphingomyelinase deficiency (ASMD; Niemann-Pick disease type A and B) is a lysosomal storage disorder characterized by abnormal intracellular sphingomyelin (SM) accumulation. Prominent liver involvement results in hepatomegaly, fibrosis/cirrhosis, abnormal liver chemistries, and a proatherogenic lipid profile. Olipudase alfa (recombinant human ASM) is in clinical development as an investigational enzyme replacement therapy for the non-neurological manifestations of ASMD. In a phase 1b study conducted to evaluate the safety and tolerability of within-patient dose escalation with olipudase alfa, measurement of SM levels in liver biopsies was used as a pharmacodynamic biomarker of substrate burden. Five adult patients with non neuronopathic ASMD received escalating doses of olipudase alfa every 2 weeks for 26 weeks. Liver biopsies obtained at baseline and 26 weeks after treatment were evaluated for SM storage by histomorphometric analysis, biochemistry, and electron microscopy. Biopsies were also assessed for inflammation and fibrosis, and for the association of SM levels with liver volume, liver function tests, and lipid profiles. At baseline, SM storage present in Kupffer cells and hepatocytes ranged from 9.8% to 53.8% of the microscopic field. After 26 weeks of treatment, statistically significant reductions in SM (P<0.0001) measured by morphometry were seen in 4 patients with evaluable liver biopsies. The 26-week biopsy of the fifth patient was insufficient for morphometric quantitation. Posttreatment SM levels ranged from 1.2% to 9.5% of the microscopic field, corresponding to an 84% to 92% relative reduction from baseline. Improvements in liver volume, liver function tests, and lipid profiles were also observed. This study illustrates the utility of SM assessment by liver biopsy as a pharmacodynamic biomarker of disease burden in these patients.

Acid sphingomyelinase (ASM) deficient Niemann-Pick disease is a lysosomal storage disorder resulting from mutations in the SMPD1 gene. The clinical spectrum distinguishes a severe infantile neurological form (type A), a non-neurological visceral form (type B) and a rare intermediate neurovisceral form. We report the first case of presymptomatic cord blood transplantation in a child with the intermediate type of ASM deficiency due to a homozygous Tyr369Cys mutation, whose affected elder brother had developed neurodevelopmental delay from 19 months of age, and had died from severe visceral complications at the age of 3. In the transplanted propositus, neurological deterioration became evident by 4 years of age; the child was alive at age 8, although severely disabled. Whereas the transplant prevented visceral progression and early death, it could only delay neurocognitive deterioration.

Niemann-Pick disease (types A and B), or acid sphingomyelinase deficiency, is an inherited deficiency of acid sphingomyelinase, resulting in intralysosomal accumulation of sphingomyelin in cells throughout the body, particularly within those of the reticuloendothelial system. These cellular changes result in hepatosplenomegaly and pulmonary infiltrates in humans. A knockout mouse model mimics many elements of human ASMD and is useful for studying disease histopathology. However, traditional formalin-fixation and paraffin embedding of ASMD tissues dissolves sphingomyelin, resulting in tissues with a foamy cell appearance, making quantitative analysis of the substrate difficult. To optimize substrate fixation and staining, a modified osmium tetroxide and potassium dichromate postfixation method was developed to preserve sphingomyelin in epon-araldite embedded tissue and pulmonary cytology specimens. After processing, semi-thin sections were incubated with tannic acid solution followed by staining with toluidine blue/borax. This modified method provides excellent preservation and staining contrast of sphingomyelin with other cell structures. The resulting high-resolution light microscopy sections permit digital quantification of sphingomyelin in light microscopic fields. A lysenin affinity stain for sphingomyelin was also developed for use on these semi-thin epon sections. Finally, ultrathin serial sections can be cut from these same tissue blocks and stained for ultrastructural examination by electron microscopy.

Acid sphingomyelinase deficiency (ASMD), due to mutations in the sphingomyelin phosphodiesterase 1 (SMPD1) gene, is divided into infantile neurovisceral ASMD (Niemann-Pick type A), chronic neurovisceral ASMD (intermediate form, Niemann-Pick type A/B) and chronic visceral ASMD (Niemann-Pick type B). We conducted a long-term observational, single-center study including 16 patients with chronic visceral ASMD. 12 patients were diagnosed in childhood and 4 others in adulthood, the oldest at the age of 50. The mean time of follow-up was approximately 10 years (range: 6 months - 36 years). Splenomegaly was noted in all patients at diagnosis. Hepatomegaly was observed in 88% of patients. Moderately elevated (several-fold above the upper limit of normal values) serum transaminases were noted in 38% of patients. Cherry-red spots were found in five Gypsy children from one family and also in one adult Polish patient, a heterozygote for p.delR610 mutation. Dyslipidemia was noted in 50% of patients. Interstitial lung disease was diagnosed in 44% of patients. Plasmatic lysosphingomyelin (SPC) was elevated in all the patients except one with p.V36A homozygosity and a very mild phenotype also presenting with elevated plasmatic SPC-509 but normal chitotriosidase activity. The most common variant of SMPD1 gene was p.G166R. We found a previously unreported variant in exon 2 (c.491G > T, p.G164 V) in one patient. Chronic visceral ASMD could constitute a slowly progressing disease with a relatively good outcome. The combined measurement of lysosphingomyelin (SPC) and lysospingomyelin-509 (SPC-509) is an essential method for the assessment of ASMD course.

Acid sphingomyelinase deficiency (ASMD), [Niemann-Pick Disease Types A and B (NPD A and B)], is an inherited metabolic disorder resulting from deficiency of the lysosomal enzyme acid sphingomyelinase. Accumulation of sphingomyelin in hepatocytes, reticuloendothelial cells, and in some cases neurons, results in a progressive multisystem disease that encompasses a broad clinical spectrum of neurological and visceral involvement, including: infantile neurovisceral ASMD (NPD A) that is uniformly fatal by 3years of age; chronic neurovisceral ASMD (intermediate NPD A/B; NPD B variant) that has later symptom onset and slower neurological and visceral disease progression; and chronic visceral ASMD (NPD B) that lacks neurological symptoms but has significant disease-related morbidities in multiple organ systems. The purpose of this study was to characterize disease-related morbidities and causes of death in patients with the chronic visceral and chronic neurovisceral forms of ASMD. Data for 85 patients who had died or received liver transplant were collected by treating physicians (n=27), or abstracted from previously published case studies (n=58). Ages at symptom onset, diagnosis, and death; cause of death; organ involvement, and morbidity were analyzed. Common disease-related morbidities included splenomegaly (96.6%), hepatomegaly (91.4%), liver dysfunction (82.6%), and pulmonary disease (75.0%). The overall leading causes of death were respiratory failure and liver failure (27.7% each) irrespective of age. For patients with chronic neurovisceral ASMD (31.8%), progression of neurodegenerative disease was a leading cause of death along with respiratory disease (both 23.1%) and liver disease (19.2%). Patients with chronic neurovisceral disease died at younger ages than those with chronic visceral disease (median age at death 8 vs. 23.5years). The analysis emphasizes that treatment goals for patients with chronic visceral and chronic neurovisceral ASMD should include reducing splenomegaly and improving liver function and respiratory status, with the ultimate goal of decreasing serious morbidity and mortality.

Acid sphingomyelinase deficiency (ASMD), a rare lysosomal storage disease, is an autosomal recessive genetic disorder caused by different SMPD1 mutations. Historically, ASMD has been classified as Niemann-Pick disease (NPD) types A (NPD A) and B (NPD B). NPD A is associated with a uniformly devastating disease course, with rapidly progressing psychomotor degeneration, leading to death typically by the age of 3 years, most often from respiratory failure. In contrast, the clinical phenotype and life expectancy of patients with NPD B may vary widely. Almost all patients have hepatosplenomegaly and an atherogenic lipid profile, and most patients have interstitial lung disease with progressive impairment of pulmonary function and hematologic abnormalities including cytopenias. Other common clinical manifestations include liver dysfunction, heart disease, skeletal abnormalities and growth delays. Some patients with ASMD who survive beyond early childhood have intermediate phenotypes (variant NPD B) characterized by combinations of non-neurologic and mild to severe neurologic symptoms. The physical and psychosocial burden of illness in patients with NPD B is substantial. Common symptoms include shortness of breath, joint or limb pain, abdominal pain, bleeding and bruising. The disease often leads to chronic fatigue, limited physical or social activity and difficulties in performing daily activities or work. Many patients die before or in early adulthood, often from pneumonia/respiratory failure or liver failure. Available treatments are limited to symptom management and supportive care. An enzyme replacement therapy currently in clinical development is expected to be the first treatment addressing the underlying pathology of the disease. Early diagnosis and appropriate management are essential for reducing the risk of complications. While knowledge about ASMD is evolving, more evidence about ASMD and the natural history across the disease spectrum is needed, to improve disease recognition, timely diagnosis and appropriate disease management.

Olipudase alfa, a recombinant human acid sphingomyelinase (rhASM), is an investigational enzyme replacement therapy (ERT) for patients with ASM deficiency [ASMD; Niemann-Pick Disease (NPD) A and B]. This open-label phase 1b study assessed the safety and tolerability of olipudase alfa using within-patient dose escalation to gradually debulk accumulated sphingomyelin and mitigate the rapid production of metabolites, which can be toxic. Secondary objectives were pharmacokinetics, pharmacodynamics, and exploratory efficacy. Five adults with nonneuronopathic ASMD (NPD B) received escalating doses (0.1 to 3.0 mg/kg) of olipudase alfa intravenously every 2 weeks for 26 weeks. All patients successfully reached 3.0mg/kg without serious or severe adverse events. One patient repeated a dose (2.0 mg/kg) and another had a temporary dose reduction (1.0 to 0.6 mg/kg). Most adverse events (97%) were mild and all resolved without sequelae. The most common adverse events were headache, arthralgia, nausea and abdominal pain. Two patients experienced single acute phase reactions. No patient developed hypersensitivity or anti-olipudase alfa antibodies. The mean circulating half-life of olipudase alfa ranged from 20.9 to 23.4h across doses without accumulation. Ceramide, a sphingomyelin catabolite, rose transiently in plasma after each dose, but decreased over time. Reductions in sphingomyelin storage, spleen and liver volumes, and serum chitotriosidase activity, as well as improvements in infiltrative lung disease, lipid profiles, platelet counts, and quality of life assessments, were observed. This study provides proof-of-concept for the safety and efficacy of within-patient dose escalation of olipudase alfa in patients with nonneuronopathic ASMD.

Acid sphingomyelinase deficiency (ASMD, also known as Niemann-Pick Type A and Type B disease) is a rare, inherited metabolic disorder. Liver-related issues, including cirrhosis and variceal haemorrhage, are a leading cause of early mortality in individuals with chronic forms of ASMD. Due to the rarity of this lysosomal storage disorder, there can be a lack of awareness that adults with chronic ASMD disease are at significant risk of cirrhosis, portal hypertension, and variceal bleeding. This case highlights an unusual presentation of recurrent variceal bleeding in an adult with cirrhosis and portal hypertension due to chronic visceral ASMD. A patient with severe splenomegaly was diagnosed with ASMD at age of 25. At age 64 they had multiple hospital admissions for hematochezia (originally diagnosed as ischemic colitis) accompanied by hypotension (blood pressure 91/45 mmHg), anemia (hemoglobin 8.5g/dL, ref 12-16; INR 1.4, ref ≤1.2), and mild renal insufficiency (creatinine 1.33mg/dL, ref 0.51-0.95). Colonoscopy did not reveal a source of bleeding. Computerized tomography scanning imaging showed diffuse venous collaterals and ascites. Arteriographies during subsequent episodes of bleeding were negative for active arterial intestinal bleeding. Recurrent gastrointestinal bleeding was found to originate from a varicose vein cluster connected to the right iliac vein and the superior mesenteric vein, located in the submucosa of a small intestinal loop. Multiple varices were secondary to portal hypertension in the context of cirrhosis. The patient died from recurrent variceal bleeding that exacerbated liver failure worsened by pneumonia and hypovolemic and septic shock. The variceal bleeding in this patient was atypical in that it originated from venous collaterals bleeding into the small intestine rather than the more typical gastroesophageal varices observed in ASMD. With long standing liver dysfunction and gradual development of portal hypertension, intestinal varices rather than occult intestinal bleeding due to ischemia should be considered in ASMD patients presenting with either hematochezia or hematemesis.
