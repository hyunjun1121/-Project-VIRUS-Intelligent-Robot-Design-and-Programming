What gene is mutated in Sickle Cell Anemia?

[PMID: 27802215]
Sickle cell anemia (SCA) is an inherited blood disorder. SCA patients present clinical and hematologic variability that cannot be only explained by the single mutation in the beta-globin gene. Others genetic modifiers and environmental effects are important for the clinical phenotype. SCA patients present arginine deficiency that contributes to a lower nitric oxide (NO) bioactivity. The aim of this work is to determine the association between hematological and biochemical parameters and genetic variants from eNOS gene, in pediatric SCA patients. 26 pediatric SCA patients were genotyped using polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP) techniques in three important eNOS gene polymorphisms - rs2070744, rs1799983 and intron 4 VNTR. Results from this study show a significant statistical association between some parameters and genetic variants: an increased reticulocyte count and high serum lactate dehydrogenase levels were associated with both the rs2070744_TT and the rs1799983_GG genotypes at eNOS gene and high levels of neutrophils were associated with the eNOS4a allele at intron 4 VNTR. Our results reinforce the importance of NO bioactivity in SCA. We presume that NO, and its precursors might be used as therapy to improve the quality of life of SCA patients.

Sickle cell anemia (SCA) is an autosomal recessive disease caused by the HBB:c.20A>T mutation that leads to hemoglobin S synthesis. The disease presents with high clinical heterogeneity characterized by chronic hemolysis, recurrent episodes of vaso-oclusion and infection. This work aimed to characterize by in silico studies some genetic modulators of severe hemolysis and stroke risk in children with SCA, and understand their consequences at the hemorheological level.Association studies were performed between hemolysis biomarkers as well as the degree of cerebral vasculopathy and the inheritance of several polymorphic regions in genes related with vascular cell adhesion and vascular tonus in pediatric SCA patients. In silico tools (e.g. MatInspector) were applied to investigate the main variant consequences.Variants in vascular adhesion molecule-1 (VCAM1) gene promoter and endothelial nitric oxide synthase (NOS3) gene were significantly associated with higher degree of hemolysis and stroke events. They potentially modify transcription factor binding sites (e.g. VCAM1 rs1409419_T allele may lead to an EVI1 gain) or disturb the corresponding protein structure/function. Our findings emphasize the relevance of genetic variation in modulating the disease severity due to their effect on gene expression or modification of protein biological activities related with sickled erythrocyte/endothelial interactions and consequent hemorheological abnormalities.

Sickle cell anemia is a genetic blood disease resulting from production of mutant beta-globin (beta(S)) and has severe clinical consequences. It is known that a higher cellular gamma-globin level, e.g., higher ratio of cellular gamma-globin to beta(S)-globin (gamma/beta(S) ratio), inhibits sickle hemoglobin (HbS) polymerization tendency. Hence, therapeutic treatment of sickle cell anemia has been focused on introducing gamma-globin gene into red blood cells to increase the cellular gamma/beta(S) ratio. Here, we have introduced ribozymes and small interfering RNAs (siRNAs) against beta(S)-globin mRNA into blood cells as a means to increase the gamma/beta(S) ratio. Single and multiribozymes against beta(S)-globin mRNA have been tested in vitro and in human erythroleukemia K562beta(S) cells that stably express exogenous beta(S)-globin gene. Primary human hematopoietic progenitor cells were also transfected with multiribozyme and the gamma/(gamma + beta) ratio determined and compared with cells transfected with long hairpin beta-globin cDNA and synthetic siRNA genes. We have found that the multiribozyme zb21A containing two ribozyme units effectively reduces beta(S)-globin mRNA both in vitro and in K562beta(S) cells. The gamma-globin mRNA to beta(S)-globin mRNA ratio in the multiribozyme transfected cells is about a factor of 2 more than that in the control cells. We have also found that the gamma/(gamma + beta) ratio in the transfected hematopoietic progenitor cells is increased by more than twofold in cells treated with multiribozyme zb21A or siRNA ib5. Our results suggest that introducing multiribozymes or siRNAs into red blood cells is comparable in their effectiveness to increase the ratio of cellular gamma-globin mRNA to beta- or beta(S)-globin mRNA, providing possible strategies to increase the effectiveness of gamma-globin gene transfer as gene therapy for treatment of patients with sickle cell anemia.

The allele-specific PCR approach has been modified by introducing a second mismatch at the 3'-penultimate link of the primer and used to identify the sickle cell anemia mutation (A-->T transversion in the sixth codon of the human beta-globin gene causing Glu-->Val substitution in the protein), thus obviating the problem of an interpretationally ambiguous 3'-terminal mismatch including T residue.

Sickle cell anemia is a genetic blood disorder arising from a point mutation in the beta-globin gene that leads to the replacement of glutamic acid residue by valine at the sixth position of the beta--chain of hemoglobin. At low oxygen tension, the mutant hemoglobin, sickle hemoglobin, polymerizes inside the red blood cells into a gel or further into fibers leading to a drastic decrease in the red cell deformability. As a result, micro-vascular occlusion arises which may lead to serious, sometimes fatal, crises. The present article reviews the historical, genetic, molecular, cellular, and clinical aspects of the disease. A review for the development and design of drugs to treat sickle cell anemia is presented. Anti-sickling agents are classified, based on the target to be modified, into three classes: the gene, the sickle hemoglobin molecule, and the red cell membrane modifiers. In spite of the full understanding of the pathology, physiology, and the molecular nature of the disease, and the development of large number of antisickling agents, a cure for sickle cell anemia still is unavailable. Strategies to treat sickle cell anemia since the early times of the disease state discovery in 1910, has focussed mainly on prophylactic measures to alleviate the painful crises. The article addresses clinical approaches used then and now to treat the disease, and the rationale of their use. Currently in clinical practice, hydroxyurea is the most commonly used agent to treat the disease, and it has been recently approved by the united states Food and Drug Administration as a drug for that purpose.

Sickle cell anemia is caused by a single type of mutation, a homozygous A→T substitution in the ß globin gene. Clinical severity is diverse, partially due to additional, disease-modifying genetic factors. We are studying one such modifier locus, HMIP (HBS1L-MYB intergenic polymorphism, chromosome 6q23.3). Working with a genetically admixed patient population, we have encountered the necessity to generate haplotype signatures of genetic markers to label genomic fragments with distinct genealogical origin at this locus. With the goal to generate haplotype signatures from patients experimentally, we have investigated the suitability of an existing nanofluidic assay platform to perform phase alignment with single-nucleotide polymorphism alleles. Patient DNA samples were loaded onto Fluidigm Digital Arrays and individual DNA molecules were assayed with allele-specific probes for SNP markers. Here we present data showing the utility of the nanofluidic approach, yielding haplotype data identical to those obtained with a family-based method. We then determined haplotype composition in a group of patients with sickle cell disease, including in those where a mathematical inference approach gave ambiguous or misleading results. Experimental phasing of genotypes across 3.8 kb for rs9399137, rs9402685, and rs11759553 created unequivocal haplotype signatures for each of the patients. In 68 patients, we found 8 copies of a haplotype signature ('C-C-T'), which is known to be prevalent in Europeans but to be absent in West African populations. We have confirmed the identity of our phased allele pairs by single-molecule sequencing and have demonstrated, in principle, that three-allele phasing (using three colors) is a potential extension to this method. Phased haplotypes yield more information than the individual marker genotypes. Procedures such as the one described here would therefore benefit genetic mapping and functional studies as well as diagnostic procedures where the identity or parental origin of short genetic fragments is of importance.

The beta gene cluster haplotypes, alpha gene status, Hb F level and hematological parameters have been characterized in 154 unrelated Guadeloupe patients with sickle cell disease: 112 with sickle cell anemia, 26 with SC disease, 15 with Hb S-beta-thalassemia, and one patient with Hb S in association with the hereditary persistence of fetal hemoglobin. Fourteen haplotypes in 16 combinations were found, the three major African haplotypes were present on 92% of all chromosomes: 73% Benin, 11% Bantu, 8% Senegal. Among SS patients, 57% were Benin homozygotes, one patient was a Senegal homozygote, one patient was a Bantu homozygote, and all the others were heterozygous. The A gamma T chain was observed on seven chromosomes and about 5% of the analyzed beta S chromosomes exhibited atypical haplotypes. The common haplotype beta C was found in all patients with SC disease. An interesting feature was the high frequency (44%) of deletional alpha-thalassemia among SS patients. Two patients have an alpha-gene globin triplication. The DNA haplotypes and alpha-gene status have been correlated with hematological parameters in these patients. The anthropological aspect of these data is interesting as the haplotypes of the beta-globin gene throw light on the slave trade from the various parts of Africa to the Caribbean Islands in particular, and North America in general.

Sickle-cell anemia results from an A leads to T transversion in the second nucleotide of codon 6 of the beta-globin gene. We now report an uncommon beta-thalassemia gene that contains a deletion of this nucleotide. Thus, one mutation (GAG leads to GTG) produces sickle-cell anemia, while the other (GAG leads to GG) eliminates beta-globin production. These data establish that different alterations affecting one specific nucleotide can produce either an abnormal hemoglobin or beta-thalassemia. Moreover, the nucleotide sequence comprising codons 6-8 of the beta-globin gene appears to be particularly susceptible to mutations affecting nucleotide number.

Retrovirus-mediated gene transfer into hematopoietic cells may provide a means of treating both inherited and acquired diseases involving hematopoietic cells. Implementation of this approach for disorders resulting from mutations affecting the beta-globin gene (e.g., beta-thalassemia and sickle cell anemia), however, has been hampered by the inability to generate recombinant viruses able to efficiently and faithfully transmit the necessary sequences for appropriate gene expression. We have addressed this problem by carefully examining the interactions between retroviral and beta-globin gene sequences which affect vector transmission, stability, and expression. First, we examined the transmission properties of a large number of different recombinant proviral genomes which vary both in the precise nature of vector, beta-globin structural gene, and locus control region (LCR) core sequences incorporated and in the placement and orientation of those sequences. Through this analysis, we identified one specific vector, termed M beta 6L, which carries both the human beta-globin gene and core elements HS2, HS3, and HS4 from the LCR and faithfully transmits recombinant proviral sequences to cells with titers greater than 10(6) per ml. Populations of murine erythroleukemia (MEL) cells transduced by this virus expressed levels of human beta-globin transcript which, on a per gene copy basis, were 78% of the levels detected in an MEL-derived cell line, Hu11, which carries human chromosome 11, the site of the beta-globin locus. Analysis of individual transduced MEL cell clones, however, indicated that, while expression was detected in every clone tested (n = 17), the levels of human beta-globin treatment varied between 4% and 146% of the levels in Hu11. This clonal variation in expression levels suggests that small beta-globin LCR sequences may not provide for as strict chromosomal position-independent expression of beta-globin as previously suspected, at least in the context of retrovirus-mediated gene transfer.
