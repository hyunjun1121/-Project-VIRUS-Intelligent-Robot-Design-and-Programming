Which gene mutations cause the Marfan syndrome?

[PMID: 3354620]
The Marfan syndrome is an autosomal dominant connective tissue disorder with pleiotropic manifestations affecting skeletal, ocular and cardiovascular systems. Because the fibrillar collagens are major structural components of connective tissue, the hypothesis has long been set forth that the Marfan syndrome is a disorder of fibrillar collagen. We have investigated this hypothesis by performing linkage studies in 12 multiplex families with the Marfan syndrome, using restriction fragment length polymorphisms (RFLP's) associated with 3 genes encoding chains of fibrillar collagens. The data exclude linkage to all 3 candidate genes in 2 families and at least 1 of the candidates is excluded in 6 additional families. Each candidate was excluded in at least 3 families. In no case was strong evidence in favor of linkage of the Marfan syndrome to any of the 3 genes observed. These data speak against the hypothesis that mutations in one or more of these 3 fibrillar collagens cause the classic Marfan syndrome.

The presence of elastic fibres in the extracellular matrix (ECM) provides physiologically important elastic properties for many tissues. Until recently, microfibrils, one component of the ECM, were thought primarily to serve as a scaffolding on which elastin is deposited during development to form elaunin fibres [1]. The most prominent protein that forms mammalian microfibrils is fibrillin. It is known that mutations in the fibrillin gene cause a heterogenous connective tissue disease called Marfan syndrome [2], so information on mechanical properties of microfibrils or their role in tissue function would be useful. Microfibrils are also found in the ECM of some invertebrate tissues, and there is growing evidence that the protein forming the structure is homologous to mammalian fibrillin [3,4]. It has been shown that the microfibril-based arterial wall of the lobster has viscoelastic properties [5], and we have now utilized this primitive artery to measure the modulus of elasticity of microfibrils. It is similar to that of the rubber-like protein elastin.

Mutations in the gene encoding fibrillin-1 (FBN1), a component of the extracellular microfibril, cause the Marfan syndrome (MFS). This statement is supported by the observations that the classic Marfan phenotype cosegregates with intragenic and/or flanking marker alleles in all families tested and that a significant number of FBN1 mutations have been identified in affected individuals. We have now devised a method to screen the entire coding sequence and flanking splice junctions of FBN1. On completion for a panel of nine probands with classic MFS, six new mutations were identified that accounted for disease in seven (78%) of nine patients. Nine additional new mutations have been characterized in the early stages of a larger screening project. These 15 mutations were equally distributed throughout the gene and, with one exception, were specific to single families. One-third of mutations created premature termination codons, and 6 of 15 substituted residues with putative significance for calcium binding to epidermal growth factor (EGF)-like domains. Mutations causing severe and rapidly progressive disease that presents in the neonatal period can occur in a larger region of the gene than previously demonstrated, and the nature of the mutation is as important a determinant as its location, in predisposing to this phenotype.

Mutations in the gene encoding fibrillin-1 (FBN1), a component of the extracellular microfibril, cause Marfan syndrome (MFS). Frequent observation of cattle with a normal withers height, but lower body weight than age-matched normal cattle, was recently reported among cattle sired by phenotypically normal Bull A, in Japanese Black cattle. These cattle also showed other characteristic features similar to the clinical phenotype of human MFS, such as a long phalanx proximalis, oval face and crystalline lens cloudiness. We first screened a paternal half-sib family comprising 36 affected and 10 normal offspring of Bull A using the BovineSNP50 BeadChip (illumina). Twenty-two microsatellite markers mapped to a significant region on BTA10 were subsequently genotyped on the family. The bovine Marfan syndrome-like disease (MFSL) was mapped onto BTA10. As FBN1 is located in the significant region, FBN1 was sequenced in Bull A, and three affected and one normal cattle. A G>A mutation at the intron64 splicing accepter site (c.8227-1G>A) was detected in 31 of 36 affected animals (84.7%). The c.8227-1G>A polymorphism was not found in 20 normal offspring of Bull A or in 93 normal cattle unrelated to Bull A. The mutation caused a 1-base shift of the intron64 splicing accepter site to the 3' direction, and a 1-base deletion in processed mRNA. This 1-base deletion creates a premature termination codon, and a 125-amino acid shorter Fibrillin-1 protein is produced from the mutant mRNA. We therefore conclude that the c.8227-1G>A mutation is causative for MFSL. Furthermore, it was suggested that Bull A exhibited germline mosaicism for the mutation, and that the frequency of the mutant sperm was 14.9%.

Two inherited disorders of connective tissue have major cardiovascular complications, Marfan syndrome and Ehlers-Danlos syndrome type IV. Major progress has been made toward understanding both the genetic defect and the molecular pathogenesis of these two disorders. Marfan syndrome results from mutations in the FBN1 gene, which encodes fibrillin-1, an extracellular matrix component found in structures called microfibrils. Histologic characterization of the effect of FBN1 mutations on fibrillin-1 cellular processing and microfibril formation has provided insights into fibrillin-1 function. Ehlers-Danlos syndrome type IV results from mutations in the COL3A1 gene, which encodes the polypeptides in type III collagen. Despite advances in the molecular genetics of these two disorders, there is not a molecular diagnostic test for these syndromes based on the identification of gene mutations. Marfan syndrome remains primarily a clinical diagnosis. Biochemical analysis of the amount of type III collagen produced by dermal fibroblasts has proven to be a powerful diagnostic test for Ehlers-Danlos syndrome type IV.

To examine the associations among fibrillin gene mutations, protein function, and Marfan syndrome phenotype, we screened for alterations in the fibrillin coding sequence in patients with a range of manifestations and clinical severity. A cysteine to serine substitution at codon 1409 (C1409S) was identified in an epidermal growth factor (EGF)-like motif from one fibrillin allele which segregates with the disease phenotype through three generations of a family affected with the Marfan syndrome. This alteration was not observed in 60 probands from other families or in 88 unrelated normal individuals. The altered cysteine is completely conserved in all EGF-like motifs identified in fibrillin, and in all proteins that contain this motif. These observations strongly indicate that C1409S is the disease-producing mutation in this family. The phenotype of individuals carrying C1409S varied widely with respect to onset of disease, organ-system involvement, and clinical severity; certain affected adults were unaware of their status before being diagnosed through this investigation. We conclude that fibrillin gene defects cause familial Marfan syndrome, that mutations in the EGF-like motif of the fibrillin gene are not uniformly associated with severe disease, and that fibrillin genotype is not the sole determinant of Marfan phenotype.

Fibrillin-1 is a mosaic protein mainly composed of 43 calcium binding epidermal growth factor-like (cbEGF) domains arranged as multiple, tandem repeats. Mutations within the fibrillin-1 gene cause Marfan syndrome (MFS), a heritable disease of connective tissue. More than 60% of MFS-causing mutations identified are localized to cbEGFs, emphasizing that the native properties of these domains are critical for fibrillin-1 function. The cbEGF12-13 domain pair is within the longest run of cbEGFs, and many mutations that cluster in this region are associated with severe, neonatal MFS. The NMR solution structure of Ca(2+)-loaded cbEGF12-13 exhibits a near-linear, rod-like arrangement of domains. This observation supports the hypothesis that all fibrillin-1 (cb)EGF-cbEGF pairs, characterized by a single interdomain linker residue, possess this rod-like structure. The domain arrangement of cbEGF12-13 is stabilized by additional interdomain packing interactions to those observed for cbEGF32-33, which may help to explain the previously reported higher calcium binding affinity of cbEGF13. Based on this structure, a model of cbEGF11-15 that encompasses all known neonatal MFS missense mutations has highlighted a potential binding region. Backbone dynamics data confirm the extended structure of cbEGF12-13 and lend support to the hypothesis that a correlation exists between backbone flexibility and cbEGF domain calcium affinity. These results provide important insight into the potential consequences of MFS-associated mutations for the assembly and biomechanical properties of connective tissue microfibrils.

The Fibrillin-1 gene (FBN1; chromosome 15q21.1) encodes a major glycoprotein component of the extracellular matrix. Mutations in FBN1, TGFBR1, TGFBR2 are known to cause Marfan syndrome (MIM 154700), a pleiotropic disorder. In the present study, we describe five novel missense FBN1 mutations in five Marfan patients that have the peculiarity to activate two contemporary mutational mechanisms: a missense mutation and exon skipping.

Mutations in the gene encoding fibrillin 1 (FBN1) cause Marfan syndrome (MFS), and related connective tissue disorders. The disease spectrum is wide and while many genotype-phenotype correlations have been reported, few have been consistent. In this study FBN1 was analyzed in 113 patients with MFS or Marfan-like features. Fifty-three mutations were identified in 52 individuals, 41 of which were novel. The mutations comprised 26 missense, 11 splice site, 7 frameshift, 6 nonsense, 1 in-frame deletion, and 2 whole exon deletions. In common with previous studies, genotype-phenotype analysis showed that a FBN1 mutation was more likely to be identified in patients fulfilling Ghent criteria (P = 0.005) and in those who had ectopia lentis (EL) (P < 0.0001). Other previously reported genotype-phenotype correlations were also considered and a new inverse association between a mutation in exons 59-65, and EL emerged (P = 0.002).

The aim of this study was to establish a national database of mutations in the fibrillin-1 (FBN1) gene that cause Marfan syndrome (MFS) in the Taiwanese population. In this study, we screened 294 patients from 157 families for the presence of FBN1 mutations using polymerase chain reaction/ denaturing high performance liquid chromatography (PCR/DHPLC). We identified 56 mutations in 62 of the 157 (40%) families including 49 single-base substitutions (36 missense mutations, seven nonsense mutations, and six splicing sites), one small insertion, four small deletions, one small indel (insertion and deletion), and one exonic deletion (Exon 36). When family history was taken into consideration, the mutation detection rate rose to 91% (29 of 32). We further investigated the phenotypic data and found that one third (47 of 157) of the families fit the Ghent criteria for MFS. Based on that data, the mutation rate was 98% (46/47). That finding implies that family history and the Ghent criteria play a more important role than clinical manifestations in establishing a clinical diagnosis of Marfan syndrome. Among the 56 mutations found in this study, 40 (71%) have not been registered in the Human Gene Mutation Database (HGMD) or in the Universal Mutation Database (UMD). This is the first study of the mutation spectrum of MFS in a cohort of patients in Taiwan. The database is expected to considerably improve genetic counseling for and medical care of MFS families.

Marfan syndrome has been associated with approximately 562 mutations in the fibrillin-1 (FBN1) gene. Mutation scanning of the FBN1 gene with DNA direct sequencing is time-consuming and expensive because of its large size. This study analyzed the diagnostic value of high-resolution melting analysis as an alternative method for scanning of the FBN1 gene. A total of 75 polymerase chain reaction (PCR) amplicons (179-301bp, average 256bp) that covered the complete coding regions and splicing sites were evaluated on the 96-well LightCycler system. Melting curves were analyzed as fluorescence derivative plots (-dF/dT vs. temperature). To determine the sensitivity of this method, a total of 82 samples from patients with Marfan syndrome and 50 unaffected individuals were analyzed. All mutations reported in this study had been confirmed previously by direct sequencing analysis. Melting analysis identified 48 heterozygous variants. The variant c.3093 G>T (exon 25) was incorrectly identified by melting curve analysis. The sensitivity of the technique in this sample was 98.78% (81/82). This study demonstrated that high-resolution melting analysis is a reliable gene scanning method with greater speed than DNA sequencing. Our results support the use of this technology as an alternative method for the diagnosis of Marfan syndrome as well as its suitability for high-throughput mutation scanning of other large genes.

The fibrillin gene encodes a protein in the extracellular matrix, and this protein is widely distributed in elastic tissues. The fibrillin gene is the site of mutations causing Marfan's syndrome. This disorder shows a high degree of clinical variability both between and within families. Each family appears to have a unique mutation in the fibrillin gene, which precludes the routine use of mutation screening for presymptomatic diagnosis of the disorder. The goal of this study was to develop a widely applicable method of molecular diagnosis. We used three newly characterized intragenic sites of normal DNA repeat-sequence variation (i.e., polymorphisms) as markers to follow the inheritance pattern of specific copies (alleles) of the fibrillin gene in multiple kindreds with various clinical features of Marfan's syndrome. The polymorphic markers allowed identification of the particular copy of the fibrillin gene that cosegregated with Marfan's syndrome in 13 of the 14 families tested. In 11 families a definite presymptomatic diagnosis of Marfan's syndrome could be made in family members who had only equivocal manifestations of the disorder. In two other families, some family members demonstrated either classic Marfan's syndrome or a milder but closely related phenotype. The copy of the fibrillin gene that cosegregated with classic Marfan's syndrome was not inherited by family members with the latter, atypical, form of the disease. These milder phenotypes, previously diagnosed as Marfan's syndrome, were not associated with aortic involvement. These results document the usefulness of novel polymorphic DNA repeat sequences in the presymptomatic diagnosis of Marfan's syndrome. Our findings also demonstrate that the various clinical phenotypes seen in selected families may be due not to single fibrillin mutations, but rather to different genetic alterations. These findings underscore the need for a modification of the current diagnostic criteria for Marfan's syndrome in order to achieve accurate risk assessment.

Marfan syndrome (MFS) is an autosomal dominant disorder caused by mutations in the fibrillin 1 gene (FBN1). Neonatal form of MFS is rare and is associated with severe phenotype and a poor prognosis. We report on a newborn girl with neonatal MFS who displayed cyanosis and dyspnea on the first day of life. The main clinical features included mitral and tricuspid valve insufficiency, aortic root dilatation, arachnodactyly, and loose skin. Despite the presence of severe and inoperable heart anomalies, the girl was quite stable on symptomatic treatment and lived up to the 7th month of age when she died due to cardiorespiratory failure. Molecular-genetic studies revealed a novel intronic c.4211-32_-13del mutation in the FBN1 gene. Subsequent in vitro splicing analysis showed this mutation led to exon 35 skipping, presumably resulting in a deletion of 42 amino acids (p.Leu1405_Asp1446del). Interestingly, this mutation is localized outside the region of exons 24-32, whose mutation is responsible for the substantial majority of cases of neonatal MFS. Although the family history of MFS was negative, the subsequent molecular genetic examination documented a mosaicism of the same mutation in the maternal blood cells (10-25% of genomic DNA) and the detailed clinical examination showed unilateral lens ectopy.

Marfan syndrome is an autosomal dominant disorder of connective tissue caused by mutations in the gene encoding fibrillin-1 (FBN1), a matrix component of microfibrils. Dural ectasia, i.e. enlargement of the neural canal mainly located in the lower lumbar and sacral region, frequently occurs in Marfan patients. The aim of our study was to investigate the role of dural ectasia in raising the diagnosis of Marfan syndrome and its association with FBN1 mutations. We studied 40 unrelated patients suspected for MFS, who underwent magnetic resonance imaging searching for dural ectasia. In all of them FBN1 gene analysis was also performed. Thirty-seven patients resulted affected by Marfan syndrome according to the '96 Ghent criteria; in 30 of them the diagnosis was confirmed when revaluated by the recently revised criteria (2010). Thirty-six patients resulted positive for dural ectasia. The degree of dural ectasia was grade 1 in 19 patients, grade 2 in 11 patients, and grade 3 in 6 patients. In 7 (24%) patients, the presence of dural ectasia allowed to reach a positive score for systemic feature criterion. Twenty-four patients carried an FBN1 mutation, that were represented by 13 missense (54%), and 11 (46%) mutations generating a premature termination codon (PTC, frameshifts and stop codons). No mutation was detected in the remaining 16 (6 patients with MFS and 10 with related disorders according to revised Ghent criteria). The prevalence of severe (grade 2 and grade 3) involvement of dura mater was higher in patients harbouring premature termination codon (PTC) mutations than those carrying missense-mutations (8/11 vs 2/13, P = 0.0111). Our data emphasizes the importance of dural ectasia screening to reach the diagnosis of Marfan syndrome especially when it is uncertain and indicates an association between PTC mutations and severe dural ectasia in Marfan patients.

Marfan syndrome is considered a clinical diagnosis. Three diagnostic classifications comprising first, Marfan genotype with a causative FBN1 gene mutation; second, Marfan phenotype with clinical criteria of the original Ghent nosology (Ghent-1); and third, phenotype with clinical criteria of its current revision (Ghent-2) in 300 consecutive persons referred for confirmation or exclusion of Marfan syndrome (150 men, 150 women aged 35 ± 13 years) were used. Sequencing of TGBR1/2 genes was performed in 128 persons without FBN1 mutation. Marfan genotype was present in 140, Ghent-1 phenotype in 139, and Ghent-2 phenotype in 124 of 300 study patients. Marfan syndrome was confirmed in 94 and excluded in 129 persons consistently by all classifications, but classifications were discordant in 77 persons. With combined genotype and phenotype information confirmation of Marfan syndrome was finally achieved in 126 persons by Ghent-1 and in 125 persons by Ghent-2 among 140 persons with Marfan genotype, and exclusion was accomplished in 139 persons by Ghent-1 and in 141 persons by Ghent-2 among 160 persons without Marfan genotype. In total, genotype information changed final diagnoses in 22 persons with Ghent-1, and in 32 persons with Ghent-2. It is concluded that genotype information is essential for diagnosis or exclusion of Marfan syndrome.

Marfan syndrome is an autosomal dominant disorder involving different organ systems. Marfan syndrome type 1 (MFS1) is caused by mutations in the FBN1 gene. Heterozygosity for mutations in the TGFBR1 or TGFBR2 genes cause Loeys-Dietz syndrome (LDS) types 2A and 2B that overlap with MFS1 in their clinical features. The phenotype of MFS1 is defined by the Ghent nosology, which classifies the clinical manifestations in major and minor criteria. Dural ectasia is one of the major criteria for Marfan syndrome but it is rarely tested for. We here report 22 novel and 9 recurrent mutations in the FBN1 gene in 36 patients with clinical features of Marfan syndrome. Sixty patients with identified mutations in the FBN1 gene and three patients with mutations in the TGFBR1 or TGFBR2 genes were examined for dural ectasia. Forty-seven of the 60 patients (78%) with MFS1 showed the dural ectasia criterion and 13 (22%) did not. Thirty-three (55%) patients were suspected of having Marfan syndrome and 24 (73%) of them had dural ectasia. Two of the three patients with LDS had dural ectasia.

Neonatal Marfan syndrome caused by an exon 25 mutation of the Fibrillin-1 gene: We describe a male infant with severe arachnodactyly, hypermobility of the fingers, flexion contractures of elbows, wrists, hips, and knees, microretrognathia, crumpled ears, rockerbottom feet, loose redundant skin, and lens dislocations. Cardiac valve insufficiency and aortic dilatation resulted in cardiac failure, decompensated with digitalisation and death occurred at the age of 4 months. This case represents the severe end of the clinical spectrum of Marfan syndrome, namely neonatal Marfan syndrome. Molecular diagnostic analyses confirmed a de novo exon 25 mutation in the FBN1 gene.

When a known microimbalance affecting multiple genes is detected in a patient with syndromic intellectual disability, it is usually presumed causative for all observed features. Whole exome sequencing (WES) allows questioning this assumption. In this study of three families with children affected by unexplained syndromic intellectual disability, genome-wide copy number and subsequent analyses revealed a de novo maternal 1.1 Mb microdeletion in the 14q32 imprinted region causing a paternal UPD(14)-like phenotype, and two inherited 22q11.21 microduplications of 2.5 or 2.8 Mb. In patient 1 carrying the 14q32 microdeletion, tall stature and renal malformation were unexplained by paternal UPD(14), and there was no altered DLK1 expression or unexpected methylation status. By WES and filtering with a mining tool, a novel FBN1 missense variant was found in patient 1 and his mother, who both showed clinical features of Marfan syndrome by thorough anthropometric assessment, and a novel EYA1 missense variant as a probable cause of the renal malformation in the patient. In patient 2 with the 22q11.21 microduplication syndrome, skin hypo- and hyperpigmentation and two malignancies were only partially explained. By WES, compound heterozygous BLM stop founder mutations were detected causing Bloom syndrome. In male patient 3 carrying a 22q11.21 microduplication inherited from his unaffected father, WES identified a novel missense variant in the OPHN1 X-linked intellectual disability gene inherited from the unaffected mother as a possible additional cause for developmental delay. Thus, WES seems warranted in patients carrying microdeletions or microduplications, who have unexplained clinical features or microimbalances inherited from an unaffected parent.

Neonatal Marfan syndrome is a severe form of the syndrome mostly caused by de-novo mutations in the fibrillin-1 gene. We report a newborn with neonatal Marfan syndrome and functional pulmonary atresia who died from congestive heart failure on postnatal day 22 despite treatment. He had a mutation in exon 29 of the fibrillin-1 gene at position c.3602G>A. Functional pulmonary atresia may be a life-threatening cardiovascular manifestation of neonatal Marfan syndrome.

Although thoracic aortic aneurysms and dissections (TAAD) can be inherited as a single-gene disorder, the genetic predisposition in the majority of affected people is poorly understood. In a multistage genome-wide association study (GWAS), we compared 765 individuals who had sporadic TAAD (STAAD) with 874 controls and identified common SNPs at a 15q21.1 locus that were associated with STAAD, with odds ratios of 1.6-1.8 that achieved genome-wide significance. We followed up 107 SNPs associated with STAAD with P < 1 × 10(-5) in the region, in two separate STAAD cohorts. The associated SNPs fall into a large region of linkage disequilibrium encompassing FBN1, which encodes fibrillin-1. FBN1 mutations cause Marfan syndrome, whose major cardiovascular complication is TAAD. This study shows that common genetic variants at 15q21.1 that probably act via FBN1 are associated with STAAD, suggesting a common pathogenesis of aortic disease in Marfan syndrome and STAAD.

Fibrillin is the major component of extracellular microfibrils and is widely distributed in connective tissue throughout the body. Mutations in the fibrillin-1 (FBN1) gene, on chromosome 15q21.1, have been found to cause Marfan syndrome, a dominantly inherited disorder characterised by clinically variable skeletal, ocular, and cardiovascular abnormalities. Fibrillin-1 mutations have also been found in several other related connective tissue disorders, such as severe neonatal Marfan syndrome, dominant ectopia lentis, familial ascending aortic aneurysm, isolated skeletal features of Marfan syndrome, and Shprintzen-Goldberg syndrome. Mutations are spread throughout the gene and, with the exception of neonatal Marfan syndrome, show no obvious clustering or phenotypic association.

Marfan syndrome is an autosomal dominant connective tissue disorder caused by mutations in the fibrillin gene FBN1, which encodes an extracellular matrix glycoprotein. Major features of Marfan syndrome occur in the ocular, cardiovascular, and skeletal systems as well as in the dura mater. Approximately 60% of known disease-causing mutations are missense mutations of single amino acid residues. Effects on the cardiovascular system are classically associated with mutations in exons 24-32 of the 65 FBN1 exons and many, though not all, reports associate missense mutations in exons 59-65 with a mild cardiovascular phenotype. Here we present 5 related individuals among whom a c.7409G>A (p.Cys2470Tyr) missense variant in exon 59 of FBN1 is associated with significant cardiovascular features. The index case also had an apparently de novo 46,XX,del(5)(q33.1q33.3) deletion on chromosome 5. This family demonstrates skeletal, dermatological and neurological features consistent with Marfan syndrome but lacks significant ophthalmological findings to date. These findings suggest that FBN1 C-terminal missense mutations may not confer the ophthalmological features of Marfan syndrome, but they also confer a more significant risk for cardiovascular pathology than that suggested by previous studies. Furthermore, clinical data from this family supports the previously reported association of dural ectasia with C-terminal mutations.

Mutations of the fibrillin gene (FBN1) are known to cause classical Marfan's syndrome, ectopia lentis and neonatal Marfan's syndrome. We have identified a novel missense mutation in exon 28 of the FBN1 gene (R1170H) which is responsible for an atypical marfanoid phenotype characterised by dolichostenomelia and arachnodactyly.

Mutations in the fibrillin-1 (FBN1) gene cause Marfan syndrome (MFS) and have been associated with a wide range of overlapping phenotypes. Clinical care is complicated by variable age at onset and the wide range of severity of aortic features. The factors that modulate phenotypical severity, both among and within families, remain to be determined. The availability of international FBN1 mutation Universal Mutation Database (UMD-FBN1) has allowed us to perform the largest collaborative study ever reported, to investigate the correlation between the FBN1 genotype and the nature and severity of the clinical phenotype. A range of qualitative and quantitative clinical parameters (skeletal, cardiovascular, ophthalmologic, skin, pulmonary, and dural) was compared for different classes of mutation (types and locations) in 1,013 probands with a pathogenic FBN1 mutation. A higher probability of ectopia lentis was found for patients with a missense mutation substituting or producing a cysteine, when compared with other missense mutations. Patients with an FBN1 premature termination codon had a more severe skeletal and skin phenotype than did patients with an inframe mutation. Mutations in exons 24-32 were associated with a more severe and complete phenotype, including younger age at diagnosis of type I fibrillinopathy and higher probability of developing ectopia lentis, ascending aortic dilatation, aortic surgery, mitral valve abnormalities, scoliosis, and shorter survival; the majority of these results were replicated even when cases of neonatal MFS were excluded. These correlations, found between different mutation types and clinical manifestations, might be explained by different underlying genetic mechanisms (dominant negative versus haploinsufficiency) and by consideration of the two main physiological functions of fibrillin-1 (structural versus mediator of TGF beta signalling). Exon 24-32 mutations define a high-risk group for cardiac manifestations associated with severe prognosis at all ages.

Genetic FBN1 testing is pivotal for confirming the clinical diagnosis of Marfan syndrome. In an effort to evaluate variant causality, FBN1 databases are often used. We evaluated the current databases regarding FBN1 variants and validated associated phenotype records with a new Marfan syndrome geno-phenotyping tool called the Marfan score. We evaluated four databases (UMD-FBN1, ClinVar, the Human Gene Mutation Database (HGMD), and Uniprot) containing 2,250 FBN1 variants supported by 4,904 records presented in 307 references. The Marfan score calculated for phenotype data from the records quantified variant associations with Marfan syndrome phenotype. We calculated a Marfan score for 1,283 variants, of which we confirmed the database diagnosis of Marfan syndrome in 77.1%. This represented only 35.8% of the total registered variants; 18.5-33.3% (UMD-FBN1 versus HGMD) of variants associated with Marfan syndrome in the databases could not be confirmed by the recorded phenotype. FBN1 databases can be imprecise and incomplete. Data should be used with caution when evaluating FBN1 variants. At present, the UMD-FBN1 database seems to be the biggest and best curated; therefore, it is the most comprehensive database. However, the need for better genotype-phenotype curated databases is evident, and we hereby present such a database.Genet Med advance online publication 01 December 2016.

Marfan syndrome is an autosomal dominant disorder affecting the skeletal, ocular, and cardiovascular systems. Defects in the gene that encodes fibrillin-1 (FBN1), the main structural component of the elastin-associated microfibrils, are responsible for the disorder. Molecular diagnosis in families with Marfan syndrome can be undertaken by using intragenic FBN1 gene markers to identify and track the disease allele. However, in sporadic cases, which constitute up to 30% of the total, DNA-based diagnosis cannot be performed using linked markers but rather requires the identification of the specific FBN1 gene mutation. Due to the size and complexity of the FBN1 gene, identification of a causative Marfan syndrome mutation is not a trivial undertaking. Herein, we describe a comprehensive approach to the molecular diagnosis of Marfan syndrome that relies on the direct analysis of the FBN1 gene at the cDNA level and detects both coding sequence mutations and those leading to exon-skipping, which are often missed by analysis at the genomic DNA level. The ability to consistently determine the specific FBN1 gene mutation responsible for a particular case of Marfan syndrome allows both prenatal and pre-implantation diagnosis, even in sporadic instances of the disease.

Marfan syndrome is a well-described autosomal dominant syndrome with widely variable clinical manifestations. Cardiovascular complications include mitral valve prolapse with or without associated mitral valve insufficiency, aortic root dilatation, and most importantly the occasional development of aortic aneurysms or rupture. Given the inconsistent phenotype along with the potentially life-threatening implications, clinicians are increasingly turning to genetic testing for definitive diagnostic confirmation. It has been well established that mutations in the FBN1 gene encoding the structural protein Fibrillin 1 is the molecular etiology of Marfan syndrome. However, there are numerous patients who meet the Ghent clinical diagnostic criteria for Marfan syndrome who do not have identifiable FBN1 mutations. Recently, mutations in TGFBR1 and TGFBR2 (transforming growth factor beta receptors 1 and 2, respectively) have been shown to result in Loeys-Dietz syndrome, a connective tissue disorder with significant phenotypic overlap with Marfan syndrome. Individuals with this Marfanoid disorder lack the ocular findings of Marfan syndrome and often have dysmorphic features such as unusual facies, cleft palate, and contractures. In addition, Loeys-Dietz syndrome patients often present in childhood with significant cardiovascular problems. This article serves to report an illustrative case of Loeys-Dietz syndrome and reviews the phenotypic consequences of FBN1 and TGFBR1 and TGFBR2 gene mutations.

Marfan syndrome is an autosomal dominant disorder of connective tissue caused by mutations in the fibrillin 1 gene (FBN1). FBN1 mutations have been associated with a broad spectrum of phenotypes. Neonatal Marfan syndrome has unique clinical manifestations and mutations. To determine if there is a discernible genotypic-phenotypic correlation associated with the unique mutation in neonatal Marfan syndrome. A newborn exhibited many typical characteristics of neonatal Marfan syndrome, including arachnodactyly; contractures of both elbows, knees, and ankles; small-joint laxity; dilated cardiomyopathy; valvular dysplasia and insufficiency; congestive heart failure; and pulmonary emphysema. Three atypical features were also discovered: a right diaphragmatic hernia, a myocardial mass, and left main-stem bronchomalacia. She died at 3(1/2) months of age. Total RNA was extracted from skin fibroblasts and amplified by means of reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction amplification with FBN1-specific primers. The complementary DNA fragments were sequenced. A single T-to-C transition at nucleotide 3276 (T3276C) was identified and confirmed at the DNA level by sequencing of genomic DNA. This results in a substitution of threonine for isoleucine. Neonatal Marfan syndrome is a unique clinical entity with recurring mutation hot spots in exons 24 to 27 and 31 to 32 of the FBN1 gene. Some clinical features in this case report are unusual for neonatal Marfan syndrome. This is the third report of this T3276C mutation in the FBN1 gene with unusual clinical manifestations. We conclude that there is a genotypic-phenotypic correlation associated with this mutation.

The diagnostic criteria of Marfan syndrome (MFS) highlight the importance of a FBN1 mutation test in diagnosing MFS. As genetic sequencing becomes better, cheaper, and more accessible, the expected increase in the number of genetic tests will become evident, resulting in numerous genetic variants that need to be evaluated for disease-causing effects based on database information. The aim of this study was to evaluate genetic variants in four databases and review the relevant literature. We assessed background data on 23 common variants registered in ESP6500 and classified as causing MFS in the Human Gene Mutation Database (HGMD). We evaluated data in four variant databases (HGMD, UMD-FBN1, ClinVar, and UniProt) according to the diagnostic criteria for MFS and compared the results with the classification of each variant in the four databases. None of the 23 variants was clearly associated with MFS, even though all classifications in the databases stated otherwise. A genetic diagnosis of MFS cannot reliably be based on current variant databases because they contain incorrectly interpreted conclusions on variants. Variants must be evaluated by time-consuming review of the background material in the databases and by combining these data with expert knowledge on MFS. This is a major problem because we expect even more genetic test results in the near future as a result of the reduced cost and process time for next-generation sequencing.Genet Med 18 1, 98-102.

Mutations in the FBN1 gene are the cause of the Marfan syndrome, an autosomal dominant disorder with skeletal, ocular, and cardiovascular complications. Aneurysms or dissections of the ascending thoracic aorta are the major cardiovascular complications of the disorder. We tested the hypothesis that FBN1 mutations cause thoracic aortic aneurysms or dissections in patients who do not have the Marfan syndrome. The FBN1 gene was screened for mutations by use of genomic DNA from two patients with thoracic aortic aneurysms who did not have the Marfan syndrome. Individual FBN1 exons were amplified with intron-based exon-specific primers; the DNA fragments were screened for mutations using single-stranded conformational polymorphism analysis; and aberrantly migrating bands were sequenced directly. We identified a missense mutation in one patient, D1155N in exon 27. Dermal fibroblasts from the affected individual were used to study the effect of the missense mutation D1155N on fibrillin-1 cellular processing. The mutation decreased the amount of fibrillin-1 deposited into the pericellular matrix. A second putative FBN1 mutation was identified in the second patient, P1837S in exon 44. Although this alteration was not observed in 234 chromosomes from unrelated individuals, the alteration may represent a rare polymorphism. Results of these studies support the hypothesis that FBN1 mutations cause thoracic aortic aneurysms in patients who do not have the Marfan syndrome. This information is important for understanding the pathogenesis of aortic aneurysms and identification of individuals at risk for developing thoracic aortic aneurysms or dissections.

Fibrillin-1 gene (FBN1) mutations cause Marfan syndrome (MFS), an inherited connective tissue disorder with autosomal dominant transmission. Major clinical manifestations affect cardiovascular and skeletal apparatuses and ocular and central nervous systems. We analyzed FBN1 gene in 99 patients referred to our Center for Marfan Syndrome and Related Disorders (University of Florence, Florence, Italy): 85 were affected by MFS and 14 by other fibrillinopathies type I. We identified mutations in 80 patients. Among the 77 different mutational events, 46 had not been previously reported. They are represented by 49 missense (61%), 1 silent (1%), 13 nonsense (16%), 6 donor splice site mutations (8%), 8 small deletions (10%), and 3 small duplications (4%). The majority of missense mutations were within the calcium-binding epidermal growth factor-like domains. We found preferential associations between The Cys-missense mutations and ectopia lentis and premature termination codon mutations and skeletal manifestations. In contrast to what reported in literature, the cardiovascular system is severely affected also in patients carrying mutations in exons 1-10 and 59-65. In conclusion, we were able to detect FBN1 mutations in 88% of patients with MFS and in 36% of patients with other fibrillinopathies type I, confirming that FBN1 mutations are good predictors of classic MFS.

It has been firmly established that mutations in the gene for fibrillin 1, FBN1, cause Marfan syndrome (MFS). FBN1 mutations can also cause other phenotypes, such as ectopia lentis (EL) and familial isolated thoracic aortic aneurysm and dissection (FAA). When the clinical presentation is typical, diagnosis of MFS is usually easy to make. However, there can be a marked phenotypic variation between affected subjects even in one family, and making the diagnosis can be challenging, especially in childhood. The objective of this study was to test the sensitivity of conformation sensitive gel electrophoresis (CSGE) for detecting mutations in FBN1 in MFS and related phenotypes. Setting up CSGE analysis for the FBN1 gene and testing the method first by screening coded samples from 17 MFS patients with previously detected FBN1 mutations. We then used a test set consisting of 46 coded samples representing MFS, related phenotypes, and controls. Sixteen of the 17 known mutations were detected. Altogether 23 mutations were detected in a test set consisting of 46 coded samples representing MFS, related phenotypes, and controls. Nineteen of the mutations were novel. The mutation was detected in 18 of the 20 MFS patients and in one patient with familial EL, but not in a patient with sporadic MASS syndrome, any of the five sporadic annuloaortic ectasia (AAE) patients, or any of the 15 controls. A FBN1 mutation was detected in four members of a multigeneration family with AAE, however. These results indicate that CSGE is highly sensitive for the detection of mutations in FBN1, and that molecular diagnostics is a useful means of confirming clinical diagnoses of MFS and related disorders. Further careful investigations are needed, however, in order to correlate the interfamilial and intrafamilial clinical variabilities of fibrillinopathies and mutations in FBN1.

Mutations in the gene for fibrillin-1 (FBN1) have been shown to cause Marfan syndrome, an autosomal dominant disorder of connective tissue characterised by pleiotropic manifestations involving primarily the ocular, skeletal, and cardiovascular systems. Fibrillin-1 is a major component of the 10-12 nm microfibrils, which are thought to play a role in tropoelastin deposition and elastic fibre formation in addition to possessing an anchoring function in some tissues. Fibrillin-1 mutations have also been found in patients who do not fulfil clinical criteria for the diagnosis of Marfan syndrome, but have related disorders of connective tissue, such as isolated ectopia lentis, familial aortic aneurysm, and Marfan-like skeletal abnormalities, so that Marfan syndrome may be regarded as one of a range of type 1 fibrillinopathies. There appear to be no particular hot spots since mutations are found throughout the entire fibrillin-1 gene. However, a clustering of mutations associated with the most severe form of Marfan syndrome, neonatal Marfan syndrome, has been noted in a region encompassing exons 24 to 32. The gene for fibrillin-2 (FBN2) is highly homologous to FBN1, and mutations in FBN2 have been shown to cause a phenotypically related disorder termed congenital contractural arachnodactyly. Since mutations in the fibrillin genes are likely to affect the global function of the microfibrils, the term microfibrillopathy may be the most appropriate to designate the spectrum of disease associated with dysfunction of these molecules. The understanding of the global and the molecular functions of the fibrillin containing microfibrils is still incomplete and, correspondingly, no comprehensive theory of the pathogenesis of Marfan syndrome has emerged to date. Many, but not all, fibrillin-1 gene mutations are expected to exert a dominant negative effect, whereby mutant fibrillin monomers impair the global function of the microfibrils. In this paper we review the molecular physiology and pathophysiology of Marfan syndrome and related microfibrillopathies.

The Marfan syndrome is an autosomal dominant disorder with pleiotropic manifestations that involve the cardiovascular, ocular, and skeletal systems. Through a number of investigational approaches, the gene encoding for fibrillin, the FBN1 gene on chromosome 15, has been identified as the defective gene causing the Marfan syndrome. Fibrillin is the large glycoprotein with a repetitive domain structure and is a major protein component of microfibrils, a fibrillar system closely associated with elastin in connective tissue. Mutational analysis of defects in the FBN1 gene in patients with the Marfan syndrome has revealed that most mutations are private or unique in an affected individual or family. Analysis of fibrillin protein or gene defects in individuals with related phenotypes has revealed that a perinatal lethal syndrome, termed neonatal Marfan syndrome, is due to FBN1 gene mutations. In addition, fibroblast cell strains from a subset of patients with idiopathic scoliosis have fibrillin protein defects. Last, fibroblasts from calves affected with bovine Marfan syndrome display defects in the fibrillin protein. These studies have wide-ranging implications in the diagnosis, treatment, and prevention of Marfan syndrome and related disorders.

Although Marfan syndrome has been a recognized clinical entity for nearly a century, only in the early 1950s were its manifestations and genetic features firmly and fully established. Similarly, although the identification of the basic defect in Marfan syndrome had been vigorously pursued for several decades, it was only in 1991 that two independent reports implicated fibrillin as the defective gene product. Surprisingly and serendipitously, these studies also revealed genetic heterogeneity of the fibrillin proteins and established linkage between one of these loci and a Marfan-related disorder, congenital contractural arachnodactyly. Like Marfan syndrome, this condition is accompanied by skeletal abnormalities; however, flexion joint contractures replace the loose-jointedness of Marfan syndrome and, more importantly, neither the eye nor the aorta are affected. More recently, a similar association with the fibrillin gene has also been established in the dominantly inherited form of ectopia lentis. These associations of structurally related gene products with Marfan and related syndromes may conceivably imply that other connective tissue disorders are caused by mutations in these or other yet undiscovered fibrillin genes.

Marfan syndrome (MFS; MIM #154700) is a connective tissue disorder characterized by cardiovascular, skeletal, and ocular abnormalities. The fibrillin-1 gene (FBN1; MIM no. 134797) on chromosome 15 was revealed to be the cause of Marfan syndrome. To date over 137 types of FBN1 mutations have been reported. In this study, two novel mutations and a recurrent de-novo mutation were identified in patients with MFS by means of single-strand conformational polymorphism (SSCP) analysis. The two novel mutations are a 4-bp deletion at nucleotide 2820-2823 and a G-to-T transversion at nucleotide 1421 (C474F), located on exon 23 and exon 11, respectively. A previously reported mutation at the splicing donor site of intron 2 (IVS2 G + 1A), which is predicted to cause exon skipping, was identified in a sporadic patient with classical MFS.

Marfan syndrome is an autosomal dominant condition, with manifestations mainly in the skeletal, ocular, and cardiovascular systems. The disorder is caused by mutations in fibrillin-1 gene (FBN1). The majority of these are family-specific point mutations, with a small number being predicted to cause exon-skipping. To date, there have only been five reports of in-frame exon deletions in FBN1, with the largest of these spanning three exons. Mosaicism is rarely recorded and has only been reported in the unaffected, or mildly affected, parents of probands. Here, we report on the clinical histories of two children with exon deletions in FBN1. Both have severe Marfan syndrome with significant signs in infancy. One patient has a deletion of exon 33, which has not previously been reported. The other has the largest reported deletion, which spans 37 exons, and also represents the first reported case of mosaicism in a patient with Marfan syndrome.

Mutations in the gene encoding fibrillin-1 (FBN1) cause Marfan syndrome (MFS) and other related connective tissue disorders. In this study we performed SSCP to analyze all 65 exons of the FBN1 gene in 76 patients presenting with classical MFS or related phenotypes. We report 7 missense mutations, 3 splice site alterations, one indel mutation, one nonsense mutation and two mutations causing frameshifts: a 16bp deletion and a single nucleotide insertion. 5 of the missense mutations (Y1101C, C1806Y, T1908I, G1919D, C2251R) occur in calcium-binding Epidermal Growth Factor-like (EGFcb) domains of exons 26, 43, 46 and 55, respectively. One missense mutation (V449I) substitutes a valine residue in the non-calcium-binding epidermal growth factor like domain (EGFncb) of exon 11. One missense mutation (G880S) affects the "hybrid" motif in exon 21 by replacing glycine to serine. The 3 splice site mutations detected are: IVS1-1G>A in intron 1, IVS38-1G>A in intron 38 and IVS46+5G>A in intron 46. C628delinsK was identified in exon 15 leading to the substitution of a conserved cysteine residue. Furthermore two frameshift mutations were found in exon 15 (1904-1919del ) and exon 63 (8025insC) leading to premature termination codons (PTCs) in exon 17 and 64 respectively. Finally we identified a nonsense mutation (R429X) located in the proline rich domain in exon 10 of the FBN1 gene. Y1101C, IVS46+5G>A and R429X have been reported before.

Mutations in the fibrillin-1 gene have been identified in patients with Marfan syndrome (MFS). This study aimed to identify the molecular defects in the fibrillin-1 gene in a Chinese family with Marfan syndrome, accompanied by aortic aneurysms/dissection. Two patients and one non-carrier in the family underwent complete physical, ophthalmic, and cardiovascular examinations. Genomic DNA was extracted from leukocytes of venous blood of these individuals in the family as well as 50 healthy normal controls. Polymerase chain reaction amplification and direct sequencing of all 65 coding exons of fibrillin-1 gene were analyzed. We found a novel mutation (c.8547T > G, p.Tyr2849X) in exon 65 of fibrillin-1 gene in a Chinese proband with Marfan syndrome, accompanied by aortic aneurysms/dissection. Sudden death at a young age of affected members was seen due to aortic aneurysms/dissection. By evaluating genotype-phenotype correlations of patients with mutations in the 3' end of fibrillin-1 gene (exons 64 and 65), we also found that the presence of nonsense mutations occurring in exons 64 and 65 appeared to be an indicator of early-onset aortic risk and sudden death. These results expand the mutation spectrum of fibrillin-1 gene and help in the study of the molecular pathogenesis of Marfan syndrome, indicating that mutations occurring in the 3' end of fibrillin-1 gene may play an independent functional role in the pathogenesis of Marfan syndrome.

The neonatal Marfan syndrome is an autosomal dominantly inherited disease with an extremely poor prognosis. This report gives a clinical and echocardiographic description of an infant with a mutation in exon 29 of the fibrillin-1 gene (FBN1), a region in which this severe form of Marfan syndrome seems to cluster. The infant died at the age of 3 months due to severe acute mitral regurgitation leading to intractable heart failure.

Mutations in the FBN1 gene cause Marfan syndrome (MFS) and have been associated with a wide range of milder overlapping phenotypes. A proportion of patients carrying a FBN1 mutation does not meet diagnostic criteria for MFS, and are diagnosed with "other type I fibrillinopathy." In order to better describe this entity, we analyzed a subgroup of 146 out of 689 adult propositi with incomplete "clinical" international criteria (Ghent nosology) from a large collaborative international study including 1,009 propositi with a pathogenic FBN1 mutation. We focused on patients with only one major clinical criterion, [including isolated ectopia lentis (EL; 12 patients), isolated ascending aortic dilatation (17 patients), and isolated major skeletal manifestations (1 patient)] or with no major criterion but only minor criteria in 1 or more organ systems (16 patients). At least one component of the Ghent nosology, insufficient alone to make a minor criterion, was found in the majority of patients with isolated ascending aortic dilatation and isolated EL. In patients with isolated EL, missense mutations involving a cysteine were predominant, mutations in exons 24-32 were underrepresented, and no mutations leading to a premature truncation were found. Studies of recurrent mutations and affected family members of propositi with only one major clinical criterion argue for a clinical continuum between such phenotypes and classical MFS. Using strict definitions, we conclude that patients with FBN1 mutation and only one major clinical criterion or with only minor clinical criteria of one or more organ system do exist but represent only 5% of the adult cohort.

Marfan syndrome is a dominantly inherited connective tissue disorder with a wide range of phenotypic severity. The condition is the result of mutations in FBN1, a large gene composed of 65 exons encoding the fibrillin-1 protein. While mutations causing classic manifestations of Marfan syndrome have been identified throughout the FBN1 gene, the six previously characterized mutations resulting in the severe, perinatal lethal form of Marfan syndrome have clustered in exons 24-32 of the gene. We screened 8 patients with either neonatal Marfan syndrome or severe cardiovascular complications of Marfan syndrome for mutations in this region of the gene. Using intron-based exon-specific primers, we amplified exons 23-32 from genomic DNAs, screened these fragments by single-stranded conformational polymorphism analysis, and sequenced indicated exons. This analysis documented mutations in exons 25-27 of the FBN1 gene in 6 of these patients. These results, taken together with previously published FBN1 mutations in this region, further define the phenotype associated with mutations in exons 24-32 of the FBN1 gene, information important for the development of possible diagnostic tests and genetic counseling.

To screen for mutations of fibrillin-1 (FBN1) gene in 4 patients with Marfan syndrome in order to provide prenatal diagnosis and genetic counseling. Potential mutations of the FBN1 gene in the probands were detected with PCR and DNA sequencing. Subsequently, genomic DNA was extracted from amniotic fluid sampled between 18 to 20 weeks gestation. The mutations were confirmed with denaturing high-performance liquid chromatography - robust microsatellite instability (DHPLC-MSI) analysis with maternal DNA as reference. The products were further analyzed by direct sequencing and BLAST search of NCBI database. An IVS46+1G>A substitution was identified in patient A at +1 position of intron 46 of the FBN1 gene. Two novel missense mutations were respectively discovered at positions +4453 of intron 35 in patient B (Cys1485Gly) and position +2585 of intron 21 in patient C (Cys862Tyr). In patient D, a novel deletion (c.3536 delA) was found at position +3536 of intron 28. In all of the 4 cases, the same mutations have been identified in the fetuses. FBN1 gene analysis can provide accurate diagnosis of Marfan syndrome, which can facilitate both prenatal diagnosis and genetic counseling.

To identify FBN1 gene mutations in a Chinese family with Marfan syndrome. Four affected and two unaffected individuals in the family were recruited after informed consent. Five ml blood samples were drawn from each family member and genomic DNA was extracted. Mutations were detected by directly sequencing to the whole coding region and exon-intron boundaries of FBN1 gene. Polyphen program was used to predict the functional and structural changes of the mutant protein. We found all four affected individuals carried FBN1gene mutations, c.2261A > G (p.Y754C), in exon18 by sequence analysis, while two unaffected family members and 100 normal controls did not have this mutation. A PSIC score of 2.6 was acquired by Polyphen program analysis. Our study supports that FBN1 gene mutation, c.2261A > G (p.Y754C), is the underlying molecular pathogenesis of this family with Marfan syndrome. This mutation is identified for the first time in Chinese population.

Fibrillin-1 is a large modular glycoprotein that assembles to form 10-12 nm microfibrils in the extracellular matrix. Mutations in the fibrillin-1 gene (FBN1) cause Marfan syndrome and related connective tissue disorders (fibrillinopathies) that show autosomal dominant inheritance. The pathogenic mechanism is thought to be a dominant negative effect of a mutant protein on microfibril assembly, although direct evidence is lacking. A significant group of disease-causing FBN1 mutations are cysteine substitutions within EGF domains that are predicted to cause misfolding by removal of disulphide bonds that stabilize the native domain fold. We have studied three missense mutations (C1117Y, C1129Y and G1127S) to investigate the effect of misfolding on the trafficking of fibrillin-1 from fibroblast cells. We demonstrate that both C1117Y and C1129Y, expressed as recombinant fragments of fibrillin-1, are retained and accumulate within the cell. Both undergo core glycosylation but lack the complex glycosylation observed in the secreted wild-type fragment, suggesting retention in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER). In addition, co-immunoprecipitation experiments show association with the ER chaperone calreticulin, but not calnexin, 78 kDa glucose-regulated protein (Grp78/BiP) or protein disulfide isomerase. In contrast, G1127S, which causes a moderate change in the EGF domain fold, shows a pattern of glycosylation and trafficking profile indistinguishable from the wild-type fragment. Since expression of the recombinant fragments does not disrupt the secretion of endogenous fibrillin-1 by the cell, we propose that G1127S causes disease via an extracellular dominant negative effect. In contrast, the observed ER retention of C1117Y and C1129Y suggests that disease associated with these missense mutations is caused either by an intracellular dominant negative effect or haploinsufficiency.

The Marfan syndrome is an autosomal dominant heritable disorder of connective tissue that involves principally the skeletal, ocular, and cardiovascular systems. The most severe end of the phenotypic spectrum, the neonatal Marfan syndrome (nMFS), is characterized by pronounced atrioventricular valve dysfunction, and death often occurs within the first year of life due to congestive heart failure. Mutations in the gene coding for fibrillin-1, FBN1, are known to cause Marfan syndrome, and have been identified in almost all exons of FBN1. Here, we describe a novel mutation affecting the invariant + 1 position of the splice donor site in intron 31, associated with skipping of exon 31, in a patient with nMFS. Published reports of nMFS are reviewed and a strict definition for nMFS is suggested. If this definition is used, all nMFS mutations reported to date lie in one of two hot spots, comprising mainly missense mutations in FBN1 exons 24-27 and mutations causing skipping of exon 31 or 32.

Marfan syndrome (MFS) is an autosomal dominant connective tissue disorder characterized by manifestations in the cardiovascular, skeletal, ocular, and other organ systems. MFS type1 (MFS1) is caused by mutations in the gene encoding fibrillin (FBN1). Recently, the transforming growth factor-beta receptor-2 gene, TGFBR2, has been shown to be associated with a second type of this disorder with typically mild or absent ocular involvement (MFS type 2; MFS2). Several point mutations were found in the highly conserved serine/threonine kinase domain of TGFBR2. Mutations in both TGFBR1 and TGFBR2 are associated with Loeys-Dietz aortic aneurysm syndrome (LDS). We searched for TGFBR1 and TGFBR2 mutations in 41 unrelated patients fulfilling the diagnostic criteria of Ghent nosology or with the tentative diagnosis of Marfan syndrome, in whom mutations in the FBN1 coding region were not identified. In TGFBR1, two mutations and two polymorphisms were detected. In TGFBR2, five mutations and six polymorphisms were identified. Reexamination of patients with a TGFBR1 or TGFBR2 mutation revealed extensive clinical overlap between patients with MFS1, MFS2, and LDS.

Mutations in the gene for fibrillin-1 (FBN1) cause Marfan syndrome, an autosomal dominant disorder of connective tissue with prominent manifestations in the skeletal, ocular, and cardiovascular system. There is a remarkable degree of clinical variability both within and between families with Marfan syndrome as well as in individuals with related disorders of connective tissue caused by FBN1 mutations and collectively termed type-1 fibrillinopathies. The so-called neonatal region in FBN1 exons 24-32 comprises one of the few generally accepted genotype-phenotype correlations described to date. In this work, we report 12 FBN1 mutations identified by temperature-gradient gel electrophoresis screening of exons 24-40 in 127 individuals with Marfan syndrome or related disorders. The data reported here, together with other published reports, document a significant clustering of mutations in exons 24-32. Although all reported mutations associated with neonatal Marfan syndrome and the majority of point mutations associated with atypically severe presentations have been found in exons 24-32, mutations associated with classic Marfan syndrome occur in this region as well. It is not possible to predict whether a given mutation in exons 24-32 will be associated with classic, atypically severe, or neonatal Marfan syndrome.

Marfan Syndrome (MfS) is an autosomal dominant inherited connective tissue disorder with variable phenotypic expression of cardiovascular, skeletal and ocular manifestations. Cardiovascular complications, such as aortic aneurysm and dissection drastically reduce life expectancy of individuals with MfS, whereas preventive surgery substantially improves the prognosis of these patients. A number of mutations in the fibrillin 1 (FBN1) gene associated with MfS have been identified to date, demonstrating considerable molecular heterogeneity. One region, however, located around exon 24, exhibits a striking clustering of mutations, which are associated with a severe, socalled neonatal form of MfS. Here we report the first mutation (G2950A) in exon 24 of the neonatal region of the FBN1 gene, associated with a classic MfS phenotype. The mutation leads to the subsitution of valin by isoleucin (V984I), both uncharged amino acids, which only differ in a single methyl group. This defect was identified in a proband with cardiovascular manifestations of MfS by SSCP analysis of PCR-amplified genomic DNA, direct PCR sequencing and RFLP analysis. The substitution was neither detected in the unaffected 4-year old daughter of the proband, nor in 3 of his healthy family members nor in 108 allels from control individuals, suggesting that this mutation is causative for MfS in the patient. Since no other family member of the proband is affected by MfS, the defect described is sporadic. In summary, we identified a novel defect in exon 24 of the neonatal region of the FBN1 gene in a patient with a classic phenotype of MfS, suggesting that conservative substitutions in this region may lead to a less severe phenotype of the disease. This finding further demonstrates the remarkable phenotypic heterogeneity associated with FBN1 mutations and stresses the significance of modifying genes and individual alterations in protein function for the pheontypic expression of the disease.

The studies on heart rate variability (HRV), a key predictor of all-cause mortality, in Marfan syndrome (MS), up to now have not been reported, especially in patients with FBN1 mutations. Among 18 MS patients with the phenotype of MS meeting inclusion criteria 15 have had a FBN1 gene mutation. Short electrocardiography records were taken in the supine position and during orthostatic tests. The control group consisted of 30 apparently healthy nonathletes matched by age and gender. Heart rates in MS patients with the FBN1 mutation were increased in both the supine position and orthostatic test (p < 0.001). Most of the time-domain (standard deviation, pNN50) and frequency-domain (total power, very low, low, and high frequency) parameters of HRV were significantly reduced in the MS patients (p < 0.001). A marked decrease in HRV, documented in the study, may be an important clinical feature in MS patients with confirmed FBN1 gene mutations.

Marfan syndrome is a multisystem disorder of connective tissue that is inherited in an autosomal dominant fashion, and results from mutation of the FBN1 gene on human chromosome 15. There are a number of conditions of the connective tissue with a similar phenotype that can be confused with Marfan syndrome. Modifications of the diagnostic criteria have recently been published, facilitating the differentiation of Marfan syndrome from these conditions. It is still difficult to use modern genetic testing for diagnosis because Marfan syndrome can be caused by many different mutations in FBN1, a large gene with 65 coding segments, while mutations in other genes can cause overlapping phenotypes. Several clinical trials of drug therapy, including the antihypertensive drug losartan, are in progress.

Mutations in the gene for fibrillin-1 (FBN1) cause Marfan syndrome, a dominantly inherited disorder of connective tissue that primarily involves the cardiovascular, ocular, and skeletal systems. There is a remarkable degree of variability both within and between families with Marfan syndrome, and FBN1 mutations have also been found in a range of other related connective tissue disorders collectively termed type-1 fibrillinopathies. FBN1 mutations have been found in almost all of the 65 exons of the FBN1 gene and for the most part have been unique to one affected patient or family. Aside from the "hot spots" for the neonatal Marfan syndrome in exons 24-27 and 31-32, genotype-phenotype correlations have been slow to emerge. Here we present the results of temperature-gradient gel electrophoresis analysis of FBN1 exons 59-65. Six mutations were identified, only one of which had been previously reported. Two of the six mutations were found in patients with mild phenotypes. Taken together with other published reports, our results suggest that a sizable subset (ca. 40%) of mutations in this region is associated with mild phenotypes characterized by the lack of significant aortic pathology, compared with about 7% in the rest of the gene. In two cases, mutations affecting analogous positions within one of the 43 cbEGF modules of FBN1 are associated with mild phenotypes when found in one of the 6 C-terminal modules (encoded by exons 59-63), but are associated with classic or severe phenotypes when found in cbEGF modules elsewhere in the gene.

Most extracellular proteins consist of various modules with distinct functions. Mutations in one common type, the calcium-binding epidermal growth factor-like module (cbEGF), can lead to a variety of genetic disorders. Here, we describe as a model system structural and functional consequences of two typical mutations in cbEGF modules of fibrillin-1 (N548I, E1073K), resulting in the Marfan syndrome. Large (80-120 kDa) wild-type and mutated polypeptides were recombinantly expressed in mammalian cells. Both mutations did not alter synthesis and secretion of the polypeptides into the culture medium. Electron microscopy after rotary shadowing and comparison of circular dichroism spectra exhibited minor structural differences between the wild-type and mutated forms. The mutated polypeptides were significantly more susceptible to proteolytic degradation by a variety of proteases as compared with their wild-type counterparts. Most of the sensitive cleavage sites were mapped close to the mutations, indicating local structural changes within the mutated cbEGF modules. Other cleavage sites, however, were observed at distances beyond the domain containing the mutation, suggesting longer range structural effects within tandemly repeated cbEGF modules. We suggest that proteolytic degradation of mutated fibrillin-1 may play an important role in the pathogenesis of Marfan syndrome and related disorders.

Marfan syndrome, the founding member of connective tissue disorders, is characterized by involvement of three major systems (skeletal, ocular, and cardiovascular) due to alteration in microfibrils. FBN1 at 15q21.1 was found to cause Marfan syndrome in 1991, and in 2004 TGFBR2 at 3p24.1 was newly identified as the Marfan syndrome type II gene. Several studies implied that fibrillin-1 and transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-beta) signaling are functionally related in extracellular matrix. Identification of TGFBR2 mutations in Marfan syndrome type II provided the direct evidence of the relation in humans. More than 500 FBN1 mutations have been found in Marfan syndrome, tentative genotype - phenotype correlations have emerged, and mouse models are providing insight into pathogenic mechanisms. TGFBR2 mutations are still limited, however, in 2005 were also reported to cause a new aneurysm syndrome. Functional association between fibrillin-1 and TGF-beta signaling in extracellular matrix has been presented. This review focuses on recent molecular genetics advances in Marfan syndrome and overlapping connective tissue disorders. Mutation spectrum of FBN1 and TGFBR2 in relation to phenotype is presented. Functional relation between fibrillin-1 and TGF-beta signaling is discussed. Future prospects in the study of Marfan syndrome are presented.

The elastic properties of many tissues such as the lung, dermis, and large blood vessels are due to the presence of elastic fibers in the extracellular space. These fibers have been shown by biochemical and ultrastructural analysis to be composed of two distinct components, a more abundant amorphous component and a 10-12 nm microfibrillar component, which is located primarily around the periphery of the amorphous component. The protein elastin makes up the highly insoluble amorphous component and is responsible for the elastic properties. Elastin is found throughout the vertebrate kingdom and possesses an unusual chemical composition rich in glycine, proline, and hydrophobic amino acids, consonant with its characteristic physical properties. The 72-kDa biosynthetic precursor, tropoelastin, is secreted into the extracellular space where it becomes highly cross-linked into a rubber-like network through the activity of the copper-requiring enzyme lysyl oxidase. Analysis of the elastin gene has demonstrated that hydrophobic and cross-linking domains are encoded in separate exons and that there is significant alternative splicing, resulting in multiple isoforms of tropoelastin. The elastin gene promoter contains many potential binding sites for various modulating factors indicative of a complex pattern of transcriptional regulation. The microfibrils contain several proteins, including fibrillin, and probably act as an organizing scaffold in the formation of the elastin network. There appears to be a fibrillin gene family in which each protein contains multiple repeats of a motif previously found in epidermal growth factor and a second motif observed in transforming growth factor beta 1-binding protein. Mutations in the fibrillin gene located on human chromosome 15 have been strongly implicated as the cause of the Marfan syndrome.
