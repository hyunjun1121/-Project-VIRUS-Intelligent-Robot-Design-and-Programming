IDEAL_ANSWER:
- Mechanistically, WDR5 functions to sustain proper execution of DNA replication in pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) cells, as previously suggested by replication stress studies involving MLL1, and c-Myc, also found to interact with WDR5. It was indeed demonstrated that interaction with c-Myc is critical for this function.
- WDR5 is a core member of the COMPASS histone H3 Lys4 (H3K4) MLL (1-4) methyltransferase complex, as a top tumor maintenance hit required across multiple human and mouse tumors. Mechanistically, WDR5 functions to sustain proper execution of DNA replication in PDAC cells, as previously suggested by replication stress studies involving MLL1, and c-Myc, also found to interact with WDR
- WDR5 has been implicated in cancer for its role in the COMPASS complex and its interaction with Myc. Interaction of the oncoprotein transcription factor MYC with its chromatin cofactor WDR5 is essential for tumor maintenance. The long non-coding RNA HOTTIP enhances pancreatic cancer cell proliferation
- Interaction of WDR5 with WDR4 and c-Myc is critical for the development of pancreatic cancer.

EXACT_ANSWER:
- c-Myc
