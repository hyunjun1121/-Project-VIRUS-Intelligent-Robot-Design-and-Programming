What delivery system is used for the Fluzone Intradermal vaccine?

[PMID: 22149703]
On May 9 2011, the US FDA approved Sanofi Pasteur's Fluzone(®) Intradermal influenza vaccine, the first influenza vaccine licensed in the USA that uses a new microinjection system for intradermal delivery of vaccines (Soluvia™, Becton Dickinson). Its antigen content is lower (9 µg hemagglutinin per strain) than the conventional intramuscular vaccine (15 µg) and it is indicated for active immunization of adults aged between 18 and 64 years. Data from the clinical trial assessing immunogenicity and safety of Fluzone Intradermal in adults were consistent with substantial experience accumulated with Intanza(®) 9 µg, the intradermal vaccine licensed on February 26 2009 and launched during the 2010/2011 season in Europe. Fluzone Intradermal is safe and its immunogenicity comparable with that of conventional intramuscular vaccines. Obtaining optimal acceptability of intradermal vaccines may represent an additional asset to help increase the coverage of influenza vaccination in young adults.
