Testicular germ cell tumors comprise of group of pluripotent tumors including seminomas and nonseminomas, arise from intratubular germ cell neoplasia and originate from the primordial germ cells/ gonocytes. Many well characterized markers of embryonic stem cells including CD9, PODXL and centromere-specific histone-H3-like protein CENPA are consistently expressed in TGCTs. In embryonic stem cells, pluripotency and self renewal capacities are provided by a network of OCT3/4, NANOG and SOX2. In testicular germ cell tumors, pluripotency genes OCT3/4 und NANOG are upregulated both, in seminomas and non-seminomas, while SOX2 is differentially upregulated in embryonal carcinomas only. Similar to embryonic stem cells, most histological elements of type II GCTs are sensitive to chemotherapy and irradiation. Furthermore, all invasive TGCTs show a consistent gain of the short arm of chromosome 12, as found in ES cells upon extensive in vitro culturing. Moreover, the genetic constitution of testicular germ cell tumors can also be linked to characteristics of embryonic stem cells, likely related to their specific inability to repair DNA damage and their high sensitivity to apoptotic cell death. In conclusion, testicular germ cell tumors represent embryonic cancers found in adults. Both the seminomas and nonseminomas have their specific population of stem cells representative of the primordial germ cells/gonocytes and for embryonic stem cells, respectively.

CENPA/Cse4 assembles centromeric chromatin on diverse DNA. CENPA chromatin is epigenetically propagated on unique and different centromere DNA sequences in a pathogenic yeast Candida albicans. Formation of neocentromeres on DNA, nonhomologous to native centromeres, indicates a role of non-DNA sequence determinants in CENPA deposition. Neocentromeres have been shown to form at multiple loci in C. albicans when a native centromere was deleted. However, the process of site selection for CENPA deposition on native or neocentromeres in the absence of defined DNA sequences remains elusive. By systematic deletion of CENPA chromatin-containing regions of variable length of different chromosomes, followed by mapping of neocentromere loci in C. albicans and its related species Candida dubliniensis, which share similar centromere properties, we demonstrate that the chromosomal location is an evolutionarily conserved primary determinant of CENPA deposition. Neocentromeres on the altered chromosome are always formed close to the site which was once occupied by the native centromere. Interestingly, repositioning of CENPA chromatin from the neocentromere to the native centromere occurs by gene conversion in C. albicans.

Combinatorial complexity is a central problem when modeling biochemical reaction networks, since the association of a few components can give rise to a large variation of protein complexes. Available classical modeling approaches are often insufficient for the analysis of very large and complex networks in detail. Recently, we developed a new rule-based modeling approach that facilitates the analysis of spatial and combinatorially complex problems. Here, we explore for the first time how this approach can be applied to a specific biological system, the human kinetochore, which is a multi-protein complex involving over 100 proteins. Applying our freely available SRSim software to a large data set on kinetochore proteins in human cells, we construct a spatial rule-based simulation model of the human inner kinetochore. The model generates an estimation of the probability distribution of the inner kinetochore 3D architecture and we show how to analyze this distribution using information theory. In our model, the formation of a bridge between CenpA and an H3 containing nucleosome only occurs efficiently for higher protein concentration realized during S-phase but may be not in G1. Above a certain nucleosome distance the protein bridge barely formed pointing towards the importance of chromatin structure for kinetochore complex formation. We define a metric for the distance between structures that allow us to identify structural clusters. Using this modeling technique, we explore different hypothetical chromatin layouts. Applying a rule-based network analysis to the spatial kinetochore complex geometry allowed us to integrate experimental data on kinetochore proteins, suggesting a 3D model of the human inner kinetochore architecture that is governed by a combinatorial algebraic reaction network. This reaction network can serve as bridge between multiple scales of modeling. Our approach can be applied to other systems beyond kinetochores.

Propagation of centromere identity during cell cycle progression in higher eukaryotes depends critically on the faithful incorporation of a centromere-specific histone H3 variant encoded by CENPA in humans and cid in Drosophila. Cenp-A/Cid is required for the recruitment of Cenp-C, another conserved centromere protein. With yeast three-hybrid experiments, we demonstrate that the essential Drosophila centromere protein Cal1 can link Cenp-A/Cid and Cenp-C. Cenp-A/Cid and Cenp-C interact with the N- and C-terminal domains of Cal1, respectively. These Cal1 domains are sufficient for centromere localization and function, but only when linked together. Using quantitative in vivo imaging to determine protein copy numbers at centromeres and kinetochores, we demonstrate that centromeric Cal1 levels are far lower than those of Cenp-A/Cid, Cenp-C and other conserved kinetochore components, which scale well with the number of kinetochore microtubules when comparing Drosophila with budding yeast. Rather than providing a stoichiometric link within the mitotic kinetochore, Cal1 limits centromeric deposition of Cenp-A/Cid and Cenp-C during exit from mitosis. We demonstrate that the low amount of endogenous Cal1 prevents centromere expansion and mitotic kinetochore failure when Cenp-A/Cid and Cenp-C are present in excess.

To investigate the mechanism of chromatin assembly at human centromeres, we isolated cultured human cell lines in which a transfected alpha-satellite (alphoid) YAC was integrated ectopically into the terminal region of host chromosome 16, where it was stably maintained. Centromere activity of the alphoid YAC was suppressed at ectopic locations on the host chromosome, as indicated by the absent or reduced assembly of CENP-A and -C. However, long-term culture in selective medium, or short-term treatment with the histone deacetylase inhibitor Trichostatin A (TSA), promoted the re-assembly of CENPA, -B and -C at the YAC site and the release of minichromosomes containing the YAC integration site. Chromatin immunoprecipitation analyses of the re-formed minichromosome and the alphoid YAC-based stable human artificial chromosome both indicated that CENP-A and CENP-B assembled only on the inserted alphoid array but not on the YAC arms. On the YAC arms at the alphoid YAC integration sites, TSA treatment increased both the acetylation level of histone H3 and the transcriptional level of a marker gene. An increase in the level of transcription was also observed after long-term culture in selective medium. These activities, which are associated with changes in chromatin structure, might reverse the suppressed chromatin state of the YAC at ectopic loci, and thus might be involved in the epigenetic change of silent centromeres on ectopic alphoid loci.

CENP-A is an essential histone H3-like protein that localizes to the centromeric region of eukaryotic chromosomes. Heterozygous and homozygous Cenpa-GFP fusion-protein mouse mutants, generated through targeted insertion of the green fluorescent protein (GFP) gene into the mouse Cenpa gene locus, show specific localized fluorescence at all the centromeres. Heterozygous mice are healthy and fertile. Cenpa-GFP homozygotes (Cenpag/g) undergo many cell divisions, giving rise to up to one million cells that show relatively accurate differentiation into distinct mouse embryonic tissues until day 10.5 when significant levels of chromosome missegregation, aneuploidy and apoptosis result in death. Cenpag/g embryos assemble functional kinetochores that bind to a host of centromere-specific structural and mitotic spindle checkpoint proteins (Cenpc, BubR1, Mad2 and Zw10). Examination of the nucleosomal phasing of centromeric minor and pericentromeric major satellite sequences indicates that the formation of Cenpag/g homotypic nucleosomes is not accompanied by any overt alteration to the overall size of the monomeric nucleosomal structure or the spacing of these structures. This study provides the first example of an essential centromeric protein gene variant in which subtle perturbation at the centromeric nucleosomal/chromatin level manifests in a significantly delayed lethality when compared with Cenpa null mice.

Centromere protein A (Cenpa for mouse, CENP-A for other species) is a histone H3-like protein that is thought to be involved in the nucleosomal packaging of centromeric DNA. Using gene targeting, we have disrupted the mouse Cenpa gene and demonstrated that the gene is essential. Heterozygous mice are healthy and fertile whereas null mutants fail to survive beyond 6.5 days postconception. Affected embryos show severe mitotic problems, including micronuclei and macronuclei formation, nuclear bridging and blebbing, and chromatin fragmentation and hypercondensation. Immunofluorescence analysis of interphase cells at day 5.5 reveals complete Cenpa depletion, diffuse Cenpb foci, absence of discrete Cenpc signal on centromeres, and dispersion of Cenpb and Cenpc throughout the nucleus. These results suggest that Cenpa is essential for kinetochore targeting of Cenpc and plays an early role in organizing centromeric chromatin at interphase. The evidence is consistent with the proposal of a critical epigenetic function for CENP-A in marking a chromosomal region for centromere formation.

Poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase-1 (PARP-1) is activated by DNA strand breaks during cellular genotoxic stress response and catalyzes poly(ADP-ribosyl)ation of acceptor proteins. These acceptor proteins include those involved in modulation of chromatin structure, DNA synthesis, DNA repair, transcription, and cell cycle control. Thus, PARP-1 is believed to play a pivotal role in maintaining genome integrity through modulation of protein-protein and protein-DNA interactions. We previously described the association of PARP-1 with normal mammalian centromeres and human neocentromeres by affinity purification and immunofluorescence. Here we investigated the interaction of this protein with, and poly(ADP-ribosyl)ation of, three constitutive centromere proteins, Cenpa, Cenpb, and Cenpc, and a spindle checkpoint protein, Bub3. Immunoprecipitation and Western blot analyses demonstrate that Cenpa, Cenpb, and Bub3, but not Cenpc, interacted with PARP-1, and are poly(ADP-ribosyl)ated following induction of DNA damage. The results suggest a role of PARP-1 in centromere assembly/disassembly and checkpoint control. Demonstration of PARP-1-binding and poly(ADP-ribosyl)ation in three of the four proteins tested further suggests that many more centromere proteins may behave similarly and implicates PARP-1 as an important regulator of diverse centromere function.

We have determined the genomic structure and organization of the mouse Cenpa and Cenpc genes. CENPA is a member of the histone H3-like proteins and is thought to replace histone H3 in centromeric nucleosomes. CENPC is a DNA-binding protein that is located at the inner kinetochore plate of active mammalian centromeres. The Cenpa cDNA encodes a 134-amino-acid product that is 70% identical and 84% similar to its human homolog. The mouse Cenpa gene is approximately 8 kb in length and contains five exons. Sequence analysis of the 5' DNA sequence of the gene revealed two consensus CAAT boxes, a putative TFIID-binding site, an Sp1-binding domain, and two cell cycle regulatory motifs, but no consensus TATA element. The mouse Cenpc gene spans 60 kb and contains 19 exons that range in size from 44 to 602 bp. Sequence analysis of the C+G-rich promoter region showed the presence of known promoter elements, including a CpG island, a CAAT box, and several GC boxes, but the absence of a consensus TATA element.

The Forkhead box m1 (Foxm1) gene is critical for G(1)/S transition and essential for mitotic progression. However, the transcriptional mechanisms downstream of FoxM1 that control these cell cycle events remain to be determined. Here, we show that both early-passage Foxm1(-)(/)(-) mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) and human osteosarcoma U2OS cells depleted of FoxM1 protein by small interfering RNA fail to grow in culture due to a mitotic block and accumulate nuclear levels of cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor (CDKI) proteins p21(Cip1) and p27(Kip1). Using quantitative chromatin immunoprecipitation and expression assays, we show that FoxM1 is essential for transcription of the mitotic regulatory genes Cdc25B, Aurora B kinase, survivin, centromere protein A (CENPA), and CENPB. We also identify the mechanism by which FoxM1 deficiency causes elevated nuclear levels of the CDKI proteins p21(Cip1) and p27(Kip1). We provide evidence that FoxM1 is essential for transcription of Skp2 and Cks1, which are specificity subunits of the Skp1-Cullin 1-F-box (SCF) ubiquitin ligase complex that targets these CDKI proteins for degradation during the G(1)/S transition. Moreover, early-passage Foxm1(-)(/)(-) MEFs display premature senescence as evidenced by high expression of the senescence-associated beta-galactosidase, p19(ARF), and p16(INK4A) proteins. Taken together, these results demonstrate that FoxM1 regulates transcription of cell cycle genes critical for progression into S-phase and mitosis.

A key element for defining the centromere identity is the incorporation of a specific histone H3, CENPA, known as Cnp1p in Schizosaccharomyces pombe. Previous studies have suggested that functional S. pombe centromeres lack regularly positioned nucleosomes and may involve chromatin remodeling as a key step of kinetochore assembly. We used tiling microarrays to show that nucleosomes are, in fact, positioned in regular intervals in the core of centromere 2, providing the first high-resolution map of regional centromere chromatin. Nucleosome locations are not disrupted by mutations in kinetochore protein genes cnp1, mis18, mis12, nuf2, mal2; overexpression of cnp1; or the deletion of ams2, which encodes a GATA-like factor participating in CENPA incorporation. Bioinformatics analysis of the centromere sequence indicates certain enriched motifs in linker regions between nucleosomes and reveals a sequence bias in nucleosome positioning. In addition, sequence analysis of nucleosome-free regions identifies novel binding sites of Ams2p. We conclude that centromeric nucleosome positions are stable and may be derived from the underlying DNA sequence.

Abnormal cell division leading to the gain or loss of entire chromosomes and consequent genetic instability is a hallmark of cancer. Centromere protein -A (CENPA) is a centromere-specific histone-H3-like variant gene involved in regulating chromosome segregation during cell division. CENPA is one of the genes included in some of the commercially available RNA based prognostic assays for breast cancer (BCa)-the 70 gene signature MammaPrint® and the five gene Molecular Grade Index (MGISM). Our aim was to assess the immunohistochemical (IHC) expression of CENPA in normal and malignant breast tissue. Clinically annotated triplicate core tissue microarrays of 63 invasive BCa and 20 normal breast samples were stained with a monoclonal antibody against CENPA and scored for percentage of visibly stained nuclei. Survival analyses with Kaplan-Meier (KM) estimate and Cox proportional hazards regression models were applied to assess the associations between CENPA expression and disease free survival (DFS). Average percentage of nuclei visibly stained with CENPA antibody was significantly higher (p = 0.02) in BCa than normal tissue. The 3-year DFS in tumors over-expressing CENPA (>50% stained nuclei) was 79% compared to 85% in low expression tumors ( 60.07; p = 0.06) within our small cohort. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first published report evaluating the implications of increased IHC expression of CENPA in paraffin embedded breast tissue samples. Our finding that increased CENPA expression may be associated with shorter DFS in BCa supports its exploration as a potential prognostic biomarker.

Inheritance of genetic material requires that chromosomes segregate faithfully during cell division. Failure in this process can drive to aneuploidy phenomenon. Kinetochores are unique centromere macromolecular protein structures that attach chromosomes to the spindle for a proper movement and segregation. A unique type of nucleosomes of centromeric chromatin provides the base for kinetochore formation. A specific histone H3 variant, CENPA, replaces conventional histone H3 and together with centromere-specific-DNA-binding factors directs the assembly of active kinetochores. Recent studies on CENPA nucleosomal structure, epigenetic inheritance of centromeric chromatin and transcription of pericentric heterochromatin provide new clues to our understanding of centromere structure and function. This review highlights the role and dynamics of CENPA assembly into centromeres and the potential contribution of this kinetochore protein to autoimmune and cancer diseases in humans.

Efficient reprograming of the donor cell genome in nuclear transfer (NT) embryos is linked to the ability of the embryos to sustain full-term development. As the nuclear architecture has recently emerged as a key factor in the regulation of gene expression, we questioned whether early bovine embryos obtained from transfer of cultured fibroblasts into enucleated oocytes would adopt an embryo-like nuclear organization. We studied the dynamics of constitutive heterochromatin in the stages prior to embryonic genome activation by distribution analysis of heterochromatin protein CBX1 (HP1), centromeric proteins CENPA and CENPB, and histone H3 three-methylated at lysine 9. Then we applied descriptive, quantitative, and co-localization analyses. A dramatic reorganization of heterochromatic blocks of somatic donor cells was first observed in the late one-cell stage NT embryos. Then at two- and four-cell stages, we found two types of NT embryos: one displaying noncondensed heterochromatin patches similar to IVF embryos, whereas the second type displayed condensed heterochromatin blocks, normally observed in IVF embryos only after the eight-cell stage. These analyses discriminate for the first time two contrasted types of nuclear organization in NT embryos, which may correspond to different functional states of the nuclei. The relationship with the somatic nucleus reprograming efficiency is discussed.

Poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase 2 (PARP-2) is a newly discovered member of the PARP family. We report the association of PARP-2 with mammalian centromeres in a cell-cycle-dependent manner, accumulating at centromeres during prometaphase and metaphase, disassociating during anaphase, and disappearing from the centromeres by telophase. Analysis of a pseudodicentric chromosome and a human neocentromere indicates that PARP-2 binding occurs only at active centromeres in a sequence-independent manner. Centromere binding peaks at the outer centromere region, and is significantly enhanced upon treatment with microtubule-inhibiting drugs. Co-immunoprecipitation assay demonstrates interaction between PARP-2 and its functional homolog PARP-1, constitutive centromere proteins Cenpa and Cenpb, and spindle checkpoint protein Bub3, but not with a third constitutive centromere protein Cenpc. These results, together with our previous demonstration that PARP-1 displays an identical binding pattern with Cenpa, Cenpb and Bub3, but not Cenpc, and that all three proteins undergo significant poly(ADP-ribosyl)ation upon gamma-irradiation of cells, point to possible diverse roles of PARP-2 and PARP-1 in modulating the structure and checkpoint functions of the mammalian centromere, in particular during radiation-induced DNA damage.

Fidelity during chromosome segregation is essential to prevent aneuploidy. The proteins and chromatin at the centromere form a unique site for kinetochore attachment and allow the cell to sense and correct errors during chromosome segregation. Centromeric chromatin is characterized by distinct chromatin organization, epigenetics, centromere-associated proteins and histone variants. These include the histone H3 variant centromeric protein A (CENPA), the composition and deposition of which have been widely investigated. Studies have examined the structural and biophysical properties of the centromere and have suggested that the centromere is not simply a 'landing pad' for kinetochore formation, but has an essential role in mitosis by assembling and directing the organization of the kinetochore.

Using a previously isolated mouse centromere protein A (Cenpa) probe, we have localized the gene to the proximal region of mouse Chromosome 5, between the known Il6 and Yes1 loci near [Adra2C-D5H4S43-Hdh]. Comparison of this localization with that of human CENPA, which maps to chromosome 2, is consistent with the presence of a new region of conserved synteny between the two species.

Anticentromere autoantibodies have been reported to be associated with scleroderma and serve as a marker in different rheumatic diseases in humans. Major centromere autoantigens described so far include constitutive kinetochore proteins such as CENPA, CENPB, CENPC and CENPH and facultative proteins such as CENPE, CENPF and INCENP. We examined the inner kinetochore component CENPI as a new putative centromere autoantigen in scleroderma patients. To test for the presence of CENPI centromere autoantibodies, 72 sera from patients with systemic lupus erythematosus and systemic sclerosis were assayed by immunofluorescence and further tested by immunoblots with an Nt-CENPI recombinant protein. 8 out of 31 (25.8%) patients diagnosed of scleroderma or Undifferentiated Connective Tissue Disease (UCTD) produced anti-CENPI autoantibodies. Epitopes were demonstrated to be located mainly but not exclusively in the N-terminal domain of the human CENPI protein. Five of the 8 (62.5%) CENPI positive sera also had other autoantibodies related to primary biliary cirrhosis. Further, two patients (25%) with anti-CENPI autoantibodies had concurrent diagnosis of primary biliary cirrhosis. This study demonstrates that CENPI, a centromere protein that localizes to the inner kinetochore structure, is a human autoantigen. The significance of anti-CENPI autoantibodies could be relevant in scleroderma patients as a marker for concurrent autoimmune liver disease.
