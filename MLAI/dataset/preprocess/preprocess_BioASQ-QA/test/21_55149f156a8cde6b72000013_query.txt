Which gene fusion is the result of the "philadelphia translocation" or the "philadelphia chromosome" mutation?

[PMID: 12730117]
Chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) is characterized by formation of a BCR-ABL fusion gene, usually as a consequence of the Philadelphia (Ph) translocation between chromosomes 9 and 22. Recently the development of new fluorescence in-situ hybridization (FISH) techniques has allowed identification of unexpected deletions of the reciprocal translocation product, the derivative chromosome 9, in 10% to 15% of patients with CML. These deletions are large, span the translocation breakpoint, and occur at the same time as the Ph translocation. Such deletions therefore give rise to previously unsuspected molecular heterogeneity from the very beginning of this disease, and there is mounting evidence for similar deletions associated with other translocations. Several studies have demonstrated that CML patients who carry derivative chromosome 9 deletions exhibit a more rapid progression to blast crisis and a shorter survival. Deletion status is independent of, and more powerful than, the Sokal and Hasford/European prognostic scoring systems. The poor prognosis associated with deletions is seen in patients treated with hydroxyurea or interferon, and preliminary evidence suggests that patients with deletions may also have a worse outcome than nondeleted patients following stem cell transplantation or treatment with imatinib. Poor outcome cannot be attributed to loss of the reciprocal ABL-BCR fusion gene expression alone, and is likely to reflect loss of one or more critical genes within the deleted region. The molecular heterogeneity associated with the Philadelphia translocation provides a new paradigm with potential relevance to all malignancies associated with reciprocal chromosomal translocations and/or fusion gene formation.

Chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) is genetically characterized by the presence of the reciprocal translocation t(9;22)(q34;q11), resulting in a BCR/ABL gene fusion on the derivative chromosome 22 called the Philadelphia (Ph) chromosome. In 2-10% of the cases, this chimeric gene is generated by variant rearrangements, involving 9q34, 22q11, and one or several other genomic regions. All chromosomes have been described as participating in these variants, but there is a marked breakpoint clustering to chromosome bands 1p36, 3p21, 5q13, 6p21, 9q22, 11q13, 12p13, 17p13, 17q21, 17q25, 19q13, 21q22, 22q12, and 22q13. Despite their genetically complex nature, available data indicate that variant rearrangements do not confer any specific phenotypic or prognostic impact as compared to CML with a standard Ph chromosome. In most instances, the t(9;22), or a variant thereof, is the sole chromosomal anomaly during the chronic phase (CP) of the disease, whereas additional genetic changes are demonstrable in 60-80% of cases in blast crisis (BC). The secondary chromosomal aberrations are clearly nonrandom, with the most common chromosomal abnormalities being +8 (34% of cases with additional changes), +Ph (30%), i(17q) (20%), +19 (13%), -Y (8% of males), +21 (7%), +17 (5%), and monosomy 7 (5%). We suggest that all these aberrations, occurring in >5% of CML with secondary changes, should be denoted major route abnormalities. Chromosome segments often involved in structural rearrangements include 1q, 3q21, 3q26, 7p, 9p, 11q23, 12p13, 13q11-14, 17p11, 17q10, 21q22, and 22q10. No clear-cut differences as regards type and prevalence of additional aberrations seem to exist between CML with standard t(9;22) and CML with variants, except for slightly lower frequencies of the most common changes in the latter group. The temporal order of the secondary changes varies, but the preferred pathway appears to start with i(17q), followed by +8 and +Ph, and then +19. Molecular genetic abnormalities preceding, or occurring during, BC include overexpression of the BCR/ABL transcript, upregulation of the EVI1 gene, increased telomerase activity, and mutations of the tumor suppressor genes RB1, TP53, and CDKN2A. The cytogenetic evolution patterns vary significantly in relation to treatment given during CP. For example, +8 is more common after busulfan than hydroxyurea therapy, and the secondary changes seen after interferon-alpha treatment or bone marrow transplantation are often unusual, seemingly random, and occasionally transient. Apart from the strong phenotypic impact of addition of acute myeloid leukemia/myelodysplasia-associated translocations and inversions, such as inv(3)(q21q26), t(3;21)(q26;q22), and t(15;17)(q22;q12-21), in CML BC, only a few significant differences between myeloid and lymphoid BC are discerned, with i(17q) and TP53 mutations being more common in myeloid BC and monosomy 7, hypodiploidy, and CDKN2A deletions being more frequent in lymphoid BC. The prognostic significance of the secondary genetic changes is not uniform, although abnormalities involving chromosome 17, e.g., i(17q), have repeatedly been shown to be ominous. However, the clinical impact of additional cytogenetic and molecular genetic aberrations is most likely modified by the treatment modalities used.

Chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML) is genetically characterized by the reciprocal translocation of chromosome 9 and 22, t(9;22)(q34;q11) which results in the fusion of BCR/ABL gene observed on the derivative chromosome 22 called Philadelphia (Ph') chromosome. About 5-8% of Philadelphia positive patients with CML show various complex translocations involving one or more other chromosomes, in addition to chromosome 9 and 22. In our report we discuss one case with CML, his cytogenetic study revealed a complex translocation t(5;9;22)(p15.1; q34; q11.2), del 5p15.1-->pter, translocation BCR(22q11.2-->qter) to der(5), positive Ph-chromosome and positive t(BCR\ABL). Further confirmation of complex translocation was done by FISH study using the LSI BCR/ABL dual color dual fusion (DF) translocation probe, chromosome 5 and 22 whole paint probes.

The BCR/ABL gene fusion, the hallmark of chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML) is generated in 2-10% of patients by a variant Ph translocation involving 9q34, 22q11.2, and one or more additional genomic regions. The objective of this study was the characterization by conventional and molecular cytogenetics of complex variant Ph translocations present at diagnosis. FISH studies were performed in 7 cases using the LSI BCR/ABL ES probe allowing the detection of the fusion BCR/ABL gene on the Ph chromosome in all of them and 9q34 deletions in 2 cases. Three cryptic complex rearrangements were detected by FISH studies. The third and the fourth chromosome regions involved in the 8 complex variant translocations were: 1q21, 1p36, 5q31, 11q13, 12q13, 12p13, and 20q12. In conclusion, FISH studies have been useful in the detection of the BCR/ABL rearrangements and 9q34 deletions, and to identify complex rearrangements that differ from the ones previously established by conventional cytogenetics.

The Philadelphia (Ph) chromosome, the product of t(9:22), is the cytogenetic hallmark of chronic myelogenous leukemia. The c-abl oncogene on chromosome 9 is translocated to the Ph chromosome and linked to a breakpoint cluster region (bcr), which is part of a large bcr gene. This results in the formation of a bcr-c-abl fusion gene, which is transcribed into an 8.5 kb chimeric mRNA encoding a 210 kd bcr-c-abl fusion protein. The Ph chromosome is also found in acute lymphoblastic leukemia (Ph+ ALL). Although the c-abl is translocated and a new 190 kd c-abl protein has been identified, no breakpoints are observed in the bcr (Ph+bcr- ALL). Here we show that in Ph+bcr- ALL, breakpoints in chromosome 22 occur within the same bcr gene, but more 5' of the bcr. Cloning of a chimeric bcr-c-abl cDNA demonstrates that the fusion gene is transcribed into a 7 kb mRNA, encoding a novel fusion protein.

Chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML) is characterized by Philadelphia (Ph) chromosome with a chimeric gene BCR-ABL created by reciprocal t(9:22) (q34;q11) translocation. Variant Ph chromosome translocations involving chromosomes other than 9 and 22 are found in 5-10% of CML cases. We here report a CML patient who carries a four-way Ph chromosome translocation, t(9;22;15;19) (q34;q11;q15;q13). The patient was diagnosed in 1997 and initially treated with hydroxyurea. In 2002, treatment with imatinib, a selective BCR-ABL tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI), was started but Ph-positive chromosomes remained at the levels of 42-65%, indicating imatinib failure. In 2006, the point mutations of F359I and L387M were detected in BCR/ABL gene, which may be related to imatinib failure. Treatment with nilotinib, a TKI with high target specificity, was then started which resulted in durable major molecular response. Administration of nilotinib offered an effective treatment in a CML patient with variant Ph chromosome translocations and BCR-ABL point mutations after imatinib failure.

Fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) technique has been successfully used to detect the BCR-ABL gene fusion in chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) with the classic form of the Philadelphia chromosome (Ph). We applied FISH to study three CML patients showing variant Ph chromosome (either complex or simple type). The results demonstrate that the use of a yeast artificial chromosome (YAC)-derived probe (D107F9) and a cosmid probe (cos-abl 8), specific for BCR and ABL genes respectively, allows also the detection of the BCR-ABL fusion in CML patients with variant Ph.

Chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) is a hematopoietic stem cell disorder that is characterized by splenomegaly and marked elevation of the blood leukocyte count with granulocyte in maturity. Ph chromosome was identified in CML in 1960 and was found to clearly result from reciprocal translocation between chromosome 9 and chromosome 22 (t(q;22)) (q34;q11). CML arises from a single pluripotent hematopoietic stem cell with the Ph chromosome and demonstration of the Ph chromosome in blood or marrow cells establishes and unequivocal diagnosis of CML. The Ph chromosome is recognized as the cytogenetic result of a rearrangement of the ABL gene on chromosome 9 and the BCL gene on chromosome 22, which leads to the creation of a BCR/ABL fusion gene on chromosome 22. Abnormal ABL-related protein with increased tyrosine kinase activity suggested a molecular mechanism of CML. The BCR/ABL fusion gene can be found not only in the chromosome but in interphase nuclei by fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH). We employed both fluorescence activated cell sorter (FACS) and FISH to study the lineage involvement of individual stem cells and progenitor cells in patients with CML. Evidence of BCR/ABL fusion was found in pluripotent stem cells (CD34+, Thy1+), myeloid cells, B progenitor cells (CD34+, CD19+) and T/NK progenitor cells (CD34+, CD7+, CD5+) but not mature T cells (CD3+) or natural killer cells (CD3-, CD56+). These data suggested that BCR/ABL gene fusion occurs in pluripotent stem cells and that Ph+ T cells and natural killer cells are eliminated during differentiation.

Chronic myeloid leukaemia (CML) is characterized cytogenetically by a t(9;22)(q34;ql1) reciprocal translocation which gives origin to a hybrid BCR-ABL gene, encoding a p2lO(BCR-ABL) fusion protein with elevated tyrosine kinase activity and transforming abilities. The t(9;22) was suggested to be associated with genomic imprinting of centromeric regions of chromosomes 9 and 22, but the genes directly affected by the translocation, ABL and BCR, were shown not to be imprinted. For most diagnostic and research purposes the BCR-ABL gene can be efficiently identified by reverse-transcription and polymerase chain reaction (RT/PCR) amplification of its fusion transcripts, which can be quantified by competitive PCR and similar assays for assessment of residual disease in the follow-up of therapy. In the great majority of CML patients the BCR-ABL transcripts exhibit a b2a2 and/or a b3a2 junction; in rare cases, the only detectable BCR-ABL transcripts have unusual junctions, such as b2a3, b3a3, e1a2 or e6a2. There is a recent suggestion that the BCR-ABL gene may not be always 'functional', since extremely low levels of BCR-ABL transcripts can be found in leucocytes from normal individuals and, conversely, it appears that no BCR-ABL transcription can be detected in a proportion of Ph-positive haematopoietic progenitors from some CML patients. The role, if any, of the reciprocal ABL-BCR hybrid gene in CML is unknown. Although its mRNA message is in frame, no ABL-BCR fusion protein has yet been identified in CML patients. The blast crisis of CML has been variably associated with abnormalities of proto-oncogenes, such as RAS and MYC, or of tumour suppressor genes, in particular RB, p53 and p16, or with the generation of chimeric transcription factors, as in the AML1-EVI1 gene fusion. It is likely, therefore, that multiple and alternative molecular defects, as opposed to a single universal mechanism, underlie the acute transformation of the disease.

Philadelphia (Ph) chromosome positive acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) is a common cytogenetic abnormality associated with poor outcome in adults. This preliminary study, in the absence of substantial evidence, reported the prevalence of the BCR-ABL gene fusion in ALL patients by RT-PCR in Pakistan. Moreover, the prognostic significance of BCR-ABL fusion along with other characteristics was also ascertained. One hundred forty six newly diagnosed ALL patients treated at our center between 2005 and 2008 comprised the study group. The patients were treated with a Children and Leukemia Group B induction regimen. Among these patients, BCR-ABL fusion oncogene was present in 43 of 78 patients (55%). A statistically significant difference in BCR-ABL-positivity within three age groups (<20 years, 20-50 years, >50 years) was observed (P= 0.001). The median age was significantly higher in the BCR-ABL+ group (30 vs 19 years; P= 0.001). BCR-ABL+ patients were also characterized by higher median WBC counts (96,000/µL vs 23,000//µL, P= 0.002). Complete remission was achieved in 74% BCR-ABL- patients and 35% BCR-ABL+ patients (P= 0.001). Only 10% of BCR-ABL- patients achieved continued complete remission (CR). None of the BCR-ABL+ patients maintained a CR further to induction therapy. With the available therapeutic protocol, the presence of a BCR-ABL fusion predicted a lower survival (P= 0.001). A high prevalence of BCR-ABL gene fusion was observed that appeared as a poor prognostic factor. Identification of this genetic entity at diagnosis is crucial for understanding the nature of adult ALL and for deciding optimal treatment.

The Philadelphia chromosome and its corresponding fusion gene, BCR-ABL, is one of the best-known genetic abnormalities in hematological malignancies. Major BCR-ABL translocation is much more common in chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML) and minor BCR-ABL in acute lymphoblastic leukemia. We experienced an extraordinarily rare case of CML with an e8a2 variant. An unusual band, other than the common transcripts, was observed in reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) for the BCR-ABL gene rearrangement. Sequence analysis of the PCR product revealed an 1172-bp e8a2 fusion with a 14-bp insertion of ABL intron Ia. The patient achieved a complete hematological response 3 months after imatinib treatment. It is necessary to keep in mind that an unexpected band revealed with RT-PCR may mean the presence of unusual fusion gene.

The translocation of the c-abl oncogene from chromosome 9 to the bcr gene on chromosome 22 in cases of Philadelphia chromosome-positive chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML) generates an aberrant bcr-abl fusion transcript which may be intimately related to the pathogenesis of CML. Because factors controlling normal bcr expression might also be involved in the expression of this aberrant bcr-abl transcript, we studied the patterns of expression of the normal bcr gene in different cell types. We found that the normal bcr gene was expressed in many different types of human cells. Moreover, the bcr gene was evolutionarily conserved, and homologous bcr genomic sequences and RNA transcripts were readily detected in chick tissue. The highest level of bcr expression in chick tissue was in brain tissue, the lowest level was in liver tissue, and a truncated bcr mRNA was noted in chick testes. Normal bcr transcripts, in addition to the aberrant bcr-abl hybrid transcripts, have been found in all Philadelphia chromosome-positive CML cells studied to date. Within a given CML sample, the relative amounts of normal bcr RNA and aberrant bcr-abl RNA were similar. In addition, the normal bcr and the aberrant bcr-abl hybrid transcripts demonstrated similarly prolonged half-lives compared with that of the normal abl-related transcripts in CML cells. These findings suggest that in CML cells, similar cellular mechanisms control the steady-state levels of both the normal bcr and the bcr-abl fusion RNAs.

In the great majority of patients with chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML) the reciprocal translocation between chromosomes 9 and 22, t(9;22)(q34;q11), resulting in the Philadelphia (Ph) chromosome produces fusion DNA sequences consisting of the 5' part of the major breakpoint cluster region-1 (M-BCR-1) and the ABL protooncogene which encodes for the P210BCR-ABL phosphoprotein with tyrosine kinase activity implicated in the pathogenesis of CML. Molecular analysis was performed on 25 patients with Ph-positive CML using 2 breakpoint cluster region (bcr) probes within the M-BCR-1 DNA sequences, and two of them did not contain either detectable rearranged DNA homologous to the 5' side bcr probe or ABL-related fusion mRNA. The chromosomal in situ hybridization technique revealed that these two Ph-positive CML cases did not carry DNAs homologous to the 5' bcr or ABL probes on the Ph chromosome. Furthermore, one of the two Ph-positive CML cases did not show either rearranged DNA or regions homologous to the 3' bcr probe on a 9q+ chromosome, while the other CML case showed a rearrangement detected by the 3' bcr probe and transposition of the 3' bcr homologous to the 9q+ chromosome. Thus, the possibility is raised that the BCR/ABL fusion DNA has been deleted in rare CML cases, and that the deletion possibly occurred in a stepwise manner following the formation of the Ph chromosome at any stage of the disease.

The t(9;22) translocation leads to the formation of the chimeric breakpoint cluster region/c-abl oncogene 1 (BCR/ABL) fusion gene on der22, the Philadelphia chromosome. The p185(BCR/ABL) or the p210(BCR/ABL) fusion proteins are encoded as a result of the translocation, depending on whether a "minor" or "major" breakpoint occurs, respectively. Both p185(BCR/ABL) and p210(BCR/ABL) exhibit constitutively activated ABL kinase activity. Through fusion to BCR the ABL kinase in p185(BCR/ABL) and p210(BCR/ABL) "escapes" the auto-inhibition mechanisms of c-ABL, such as allosteric inhibition. A novel class of compounds including GNF-2 restores allosteric inhibition of the kinase activity and the transformation potential of BCR/ABL. Here we investigated whether there are differences between p185(BCR/ABL) and p210(BCR/ABL) regarding their sensitivity towards allosteric inhibition by GNF-2 in models of Philadelphia chromosome-positive acute lymphatic leukemia. We investigated the anti-proliferative activity of GNF-2 in different Philadelphia chromosome-positive acute lymphatic leukemia models, such as cell lines, patient-derived long-term cultures and factor-dependent lymphatic Ba/F3 cells expressing either p185(BCR/ABL) or p210(BCR/ABL) and their resistance mutants. The inhibitory effects of GNF-2 differed constantly between p185(BCR/ABL) and p210(BCR/ABL) expressing cells. In all three Philadelphia chromosome-positive acute lymphatic leukemia models, p210(BCR/ABL)-transformed cells were more sensitive to GNF-2 than were p185BCR/ABL-positive cells. Similar results were obtained for p185(BCR/ABL) and the p210(BCR/ABL) harboring resistance mutations. Our data provide the first evidence of a differential response of p185(BCR/ABL)- and p210(BCR/ABL)- transformed cells to allosteric inhibition by GNF-2, which is of importance for the treatment of patients with Philadelphia chromosome-positive acute lymphatic leukemia.

Chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) is associated with the Philadelphia chromosome, which arises by a reciprocal translocation between chromosomes 9 and 22 and harbors the BCR-ABL fusion oncogene. It is unknown whether any other mutations are needed for the chronic phase of the disease. The CML incidence increases as a function of age with an exponent of approximately 3. A slope of 3 could indicate that there are two mutations, in addition to the Philadelphia translocation, that have not yet been discovered. In this work, we explore an alternative hypothesis: We study a model of cancer initiation requiring only a single mutation. A mutated cell has a net reproductive advantage over normal cells and, therefore, might give rise to clonal expansion. The cancer is detected with a probability that is proportional to the size of the mutated cell clone. This model has three waiting times: (i) the time until a mutated cell is produced, (ii) the time of clonal expansion, and (iii) the time until the clone is detected. Surprisingly, this simple process can give rise to cancer incidence curves with exponents up to 3. Therefore, the CML incidence data are consistent with the hypothesis that the Philadelphia translocation alone is sufficient to cause chronic phase CML.

We report a cytogenetic study of a patient with chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML) who, while displaying a Philadelphia (Ph) chromosome, resulting from a standard t(9;22) at diagnosis, during the chronic phase (CP) showed disappearance of the Ph and occurrence of new chromosome changes, including a marker probably arising from a translocation involving chromosome 17 and the Ph. In situ hybridization confirmed the cytogenetic appearance and demonstrated that the breakpoint on the Ph marker occurred below the BCR-ABL fusion gene.

The reciprocal translocation between chromosome 9 and chromosome 22, as observed in chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) as well as in acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL), results in a 22q- chromosome, the so-called Philadelphia chromosome. The translocation event creates on the Philadelphia chromosome a fusion between two genes: bcr and abl. Depending on the localization of the breakpoint in the bcr gene different chimeric bcr-abl genes are generated, each encoding their own tumor-specific protein: e1-a2P190bcr-abl, b2-a2p210bcr-abl, or b3-a2P210bcr-abl. Especially in ALL, the presence of such a tumor-specific protein is highly associated with a poor prognosis. Detection of these proteins therefore has a strong clinical significance. In this study a polyclonal antiserum, termed BP-2, was raised against a synthetic peptide, corresponding to the tumor-specific 'fusion-point' epitope of the b3-a2P210bcr-abl protein. The specificity of BP-2 for the bcr-abl joining region in b3-a2P210bcr-abl is demonstrated by means of peptide inhibition studies in combination with immunoprecipitation. In addition we show the reactivity of BP-2 with bcr-abl proteins in leukemic cells of a Philadelphia-chromosome-positive ALL patient.

Chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) is characterized by formation of the BCR-ABL fusion gene, usually as a consequence of the Philadelphia (Ph) translocation between chromosomes 9 and 22. Large deletions on the derivative chromosome 9 have recently been reported, but it was unclear whether deletions arose during disease progression or at the time of the Ph translocation. Fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) analysis was used to assess the deletion status of 253 patients with CML. The strength of deletion status as a prognostic indicator was then compared to the Sokal and Hasford scoring systems. The frequency of deletions was similar at diagnosis and after disease progression but was significantly increased in patients with variant Ph translocations. In patients with a deletion, all Ph(+) metaphases carried the deletion. The median survival of patients with and without deletions was 38 months and 88 months, respectively (P =.0001). By contrast the survival difference between Sokal or Hasford high-risk and non-high-risk patients was of only borderline significance (P =.057 and P =.034). The results indicate that deletions occur at the time of the Ph translocation. An apparently simple reciprocal translocation may therefore result in considerable genetic heterogeneity ab initio, a concept that is likely to apply to other malignancies associated with translocations. Deletion status is also a powerful and independent prognostic factor for patients with CML. The prognostic significance of deletion status should now be studied prospectively and, if confirmed, should be incorporated into management decisions and the analysis of clinical trials.

The t(9;22)(q34;q11) translocation leading to the Philadelphia (Ph) chromosome resulting in BCR-ABL gene fusion is associated with a poor prognosis in acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL). We studied the relation between t(9;22), determined by karyotype, fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) or polymerase chain reaction (PCR), and in vitro drug resistance, measured by the MTT assay, in precursor B-cell ALL at diagnosis. The findings in twenty-one Ph-positive (Ph+) childhood common/precursorB (c/preB) cases were compared with 254 Ph-negative (Ph-) ALL cases. A large range of LC(50) values was found within the Ph+ patients. Moreover, LC(50) values did not differ significantly between Ph+ and Ph- samples for prednisolone, dexamethasone, L-asparaginase, vincristine, anthracyclines, thiopurines, epipodophyllotoxins, and 4H00-ifosfamide, even after matching for important prognostic features (age, white blood cell count (WBC), and immunophenotype). Adult Ph+ (n = 12) ALL was more resistant to prednisolone (> 270-fold, P = 0.030), and displayed an overall tendency to resistance when compared to matched cases of Ph- (n = 15) adult precursor B-cell ALL. Within Ph+ ALL, in vitro prednisolone resistance increased significantly with age (P = 0.006). The expression of lung resistance protein (LRP), but not P-glycoprotein (P-gp) or multidrug resistance protein (MRP), was significantly higher in all Ph+ patients. Both childhood and adult Ph+ precursor B-cell ALL samples display a heterogeneous in vitro resistance profile, with relatively sensitive and resistant cases. The adult Ph+ samples, however, are generally more resistant compared to matched Ph- controls, reaching significance for prednisolone. The correlation of prednisolone resistance with age within the Ph+ cases might help explain the poorer prognosis of adult Ph+ ALL.

We have previously shown that the chimeric gene ABL-BCR, formed on the derivative chromosome 9q+ as a result of the t(9;22) translocation, is transcriptionally active in 65% of chronic myeloid leukemia patients. We have now used the same technique, reverse transcription/polymerase chain reaction amplification of ABL-BCR transcripts, to study nine patients with Philadelphia (Ph) chromosome-positive acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL); seven expressed the P190 and two the P210 type of BCR-ABL fusion protein. All seven patients with P190 had ABL-BCR transcripts containing a junction between ABL exon Ib and BCR exon 2 (Ib-e2); in two cases, ABL-BCR transcripts with the Ia-e2 junction type were also present. Of the two P210 ALL patients, one had a Ib-b4 ABL-BCR transcript and the other showed no detectable ABL-BCR expression. Although the BCR-ABL gene is probably fundamental in the pathogenesis of the Ph+ leukemias, differential expression of the ABL-BCR gene could contribute to the biologic heterogeneity of the disease.

The so-called Philadelphia (Ph) chromosome is present in more than 90% of chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) patients. Approximately, 5-10% of these patients show complex translocations involving a third chromosome in addition to chromosomes 9 and 22. Since at present the majority of CML cases are treated with imatinib, variant rearrangements do not exhibit specific prognostic significance. However, events of therapy resistance remain to be studied. In this study, we report a unique case of CML exhibiting an uncommon t(21;22)(p12;q11). This translocation has been characterized by fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) and array-proven multicolor banding (aMCB). Using specific probes for the BCR and ABL genes, results of FISH showed a three-way variant Philadelphia translocation (9;22;21)(q34;q11;p12) with a BCR/ABL fusion residing on the der(22) and the 3'BCR region translocated on the short arm of the derivative chromosome 21. In addition, the aMCB technique is significant in the detection of the breakpoints of genetic changes. The underlying mechanisms and prognostic significance of these changes are discussed.
