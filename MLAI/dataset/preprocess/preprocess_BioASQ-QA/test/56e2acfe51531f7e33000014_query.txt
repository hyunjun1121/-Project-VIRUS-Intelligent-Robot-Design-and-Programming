Cohesin complex acts in the formation and maintenance of sister chromatid cohesion during and after S phase. Budding yeast Scc1p/Mcd1p, an essential subunit, is cleaved and dissociates from chromosomes in anaphase, leading to sister chromatid separation. Most cohesin in higher eukaryotes, in contrast, is dissociated from chromosomes well before anaphase. The universal role of cohesin during anaphase thus remains to be determined. We report here initial characterization of four putative cohesin subunits, Psm1, Psm3, Rad21, and Psc3, in fission yeast. They are essential for sister chromatid cohesion. Immunoprecipitation demonstrates stable complex formation of Rad21 with Psm1 and Psm3 but not with Psc3. Chromatin immunoprecipitation shows that cohesin subunits are enriched in broad centromere regions and that the level of centromere-associated Rad21 did not change from metaphase to anaphase, very different from budding yeast. In contrast, Rad21 containing similar cleavage sites to those of Scc1p/Mcd1p is cleaved specifically in anaphase. This cleavage is essential, although the amount of cleaved product is very small (<5%). Mis4, another sister chromatid cohesion protein, plays an essential role for loading Rad21 on chromatin. A simple model is presented to explain the specific behavior of fission yeast cohesin and why only a tiny fraction of Rad21 is sufficient to be cleaved for normal anaphase.

The 2-microm yeast plasmid, a benign high-copy nuclear parasite, propagates itself with nearly the same fidelity as the chromosomes of its host. Equal plasmid segregation is absolutely dependent on the cohesin complex assembled at the plasmid partitioning locus STB. However, the mechanism of cohesin action in the context of multiple plasmid copies, resident within two separate clusters after DNA replication, is unknown. By using "single-copy" derivatives of the 2-microm plasmid, we demonstrate that recruitment of cohesin at STB during S phase indeed translates into cohesion between plasmid molecules. Through binary fluorescence tagging, we reveal that segregation of replicated plasmids occurs in a sister-to-sister fashion. Thus, cohesin serves the same fundamental purpose in plasmid and chromosome segregation.

The 2 microm circle plasmid in Saccharomyces cerevisiae is a model for a stable, high-copy-number, extrachromosomal "selfish" DNA element. By combining a partitioning system and an amplification system, the plasmid ensures its stable propagation and copy number maintenance, even though it does not provide any selective advantage to its host. Recent evidence suggests that the partitioning system couples plasmid segregation to chromosome segregation. We now demonstrate an unexpected and unconventional role for the mitotic spindle in the plasmid-partitioning pathway. The spindle specifies the nuclear address of the 2 microm circle and promotes recruitment of the cohesin complex to the plasmid-partitioning locus STB. Only the nuclear microtubules, and not the cytoplasmic ones, are required for loading cohesin at STB. In cells recovering from nocodazole-induced spindle depolymerization and G(2)/M arrest, cohesin-STB association can be established coincident with spindle restoration. This postreplication recruitment of cohesin is not functional in equipartitioning. However, normally acquired cohesin can be inactivated after replication without causing plasmid missegregation. In the mtw1-1 mutant yeast strain, the plasmid cosegregates with the spindle and the spindle-associated chromosomes; by contrast, a substantial number of the chromosomes are not associated with the spindle. These results are consistent with a model in which the spindle promotes plasmid segregation in a chromosome-linked fashion.

Sister chromatid cohesion (SCC), efficient DNA repair, and the regulation of some metazoan genes require the association of cohesins with chromosomes. Cohesins are deposited by a conserved heterodimeric loading complex composed of the Scc2 and Scc4 proteins in Saccharomyces cerevisiae, but how the Scc2/Scc4 deposition complex regulates the spatiotemporal association of cohesin with chromosomes is not understood. We examined Scc2 chromatin association during the cell division cycle and found that the affinity of Scc2 for chromatin increases biphasically during the cell cycle, increasing first transiently in late G1 phase and then again later in G2/M. Inactivation of Scc2 following DNA replication reduces cellular viability, suggesting that this post S-phase increase in Scc2 chromatin binding affinity is biologically relevant. Interestingly, high and low Scc2 chromatin binding levels correlate strongly with the presence of full-length or amino-terminally cleaved forms of Scc2, respectively, and the appearance of the cleaved Scc2 species is promoted in vitro either by treatment with specific cell cycle-staged cellular extracts or by dephosphorylation. Importantly, Scc2 cleavage eliminates Scc2-Scc4 physical interactions, and an scc2 truncation mutant that mimics in vivo Scc2 cleavage is defective for cohesin deposition. These observations suggest a previously unidentified mechanism for the spatiotemporal regulation of cohesin association with chromosomes through cell cycle regulation of Scc2 cohesin deposition activity by Scc2 dephosphorylation and cleavage.

In the budding yeast, cohesin is loaded onto the chromosome during the late G1 phase, establishes sister chromatid cohesion concomitant with DNA replication, and dissociates by the telophase. Here, using oligonucleotide tiling arrays, we show that, at the anaphase, nearly all of the cohesin binding sites contain nucleosome-free regions. The majority of these sites remain nucleosome-free throughout the cell cycle, consistent with the suggestion of a DNA-binding anchoring protein present at these sites, although such a region could also serve as part of a marker for the binding of cohesin in the next cell cycle. However, a third of these sites are remodeled in the G1 phase, being reoccupied by nucleosomes by the G1/S boundary, though their subsequent removal in the S phase appears to be independent of DNA replication. Whether this difference is a result of other functions of cohesin or of the chromatin remains to be elucidated.

In eukaryotic cells, replicated DNA strands remain physically connected until their segregation to opposite poles of the cell during anaphase. This "sister chromatid cohesion" is essential for the alignment of chromosomes on the mitotic spindle during metaphase. Cohesion depends on the multisubunit cohesin complex, which possibly forms the physical bridges connecting sisters. Proteolytic cleavage of cohesin's Sccl subunit at the metaphase to anaphase transition is essential for sister chromatid separation and depends on a conserved protein called separin. We show here that separin is a cysteine protease related to caspases that alone can cleave Sccl in vitro. Cleavage of Sccl in metaphase arrested cells is sufficient to trigger the separation of sister chromatids and their segregation to opposite cell poles.

At anaphase onset, the protease separase triggers chromosome segregation by cleaving the chromosomal cohesin complex. Here, we show that cohesin destruction in metaphase is sufficient for segregation of much of the budding yeast genome, but not of the long arm of chromosome XII that contains the rDNA repeats. rDNA in metaphase, unlike most other sequences, remains in an undercondensed and topologically entangled state. Separase, concomitantly with cleaving cohesin, activates the phosphatase Cdc14. We find that Cdc14 exerts two effects on rDNA, both mediated by the condensin complex. Lengthwise condensation of rDNA shortens the chromosome XII arm sufficiently for segregation. This condensation depends on the aurora B kinase complex. Independently of condensation, Cdc14 induces condensin-dependent resolution of cohesin-independent rDNA linkage. Cdc14-dependent sister chromatid resolution at the rDNA could introduce a temporal order to chromosome segregation.

In eukaryotic cells, cohesin holds sister chromatids together until they separate into daughter cells during mitosis. We have used chromatin immunoprecipitation coupled with microarray analysis (ChIP chip) to produce a genome-wide description of cohesin binding to meiotic and mitotic chromosomes of Saccharomyces cerevisiae. A computer program, PeakFinder, enables flexible, automated identification and annotation of cohesin binding peaks in ChIP chip data. Cohesin sites are highly conserved in meiosis and mitosis, suggesting that chromosomes share a common underlying structure during different developmental programs. These sites occur with a semiperiodic spacing of 11 kb that correlates with AT content. The number of sites correlates with chromosome size; however, binding to neighboring sites does not appear to be cooperative. We observed a very strong correlation between cohesin sites and regions between convergent transcription units. The apparent incompatibility between transcription and cohesin binding exists in both meiosis and mitosis. Further experiments reveal that transcript elongation into a cohesin-binding site removes cohesin. A negative correlation between cohesin sites and meiotic recombination sites suggests meiotic exchange is sensitive to the chromosome structure provided by cohesin. The genome-wide view of mitotic and meiotic cohesin binding provides an important framework for the exploration of cohesins and cohesion in other genomes.

Sister chromatid cohesion is mediated by cohesin, but the process of cohesion establishment during S-phase is still enigmatic. In mammalian cells, cohesin binding to chromatin is dynamic in G1, but becomes stabilized during S-phase. Whether the regulation of cohesin stability is integral to the process of cohesion establishment is unknown. Here, we provide evidence that fission yeast cohesin also displays dynamic behavior. Cohesin association with G1 chromosomes requires continued activity of the cohesin loader Mis4/Ssl3, suggesting that repeated loading cycles maintain cohesin binding. Cohesin instability in G1 depends on wpl1, the fission yeast ortholog of mammalian Wapl, suggestive of a conserved mechanism that controls cohesin stability on chromosomes. wpl1 is nonessential, indicating that a change in wpl1-dependent cohesin dynamics is dispensable for cohesion establishment. Instead, we find that cohesin stability increases at the time of S-phase in a reaction that can be uncoupled from DNA replication. Hence, cohesin stabilization might be a pre-requisite for cohesion establishment rather than its consequence.

Sister chromatid cohesion is crucial for chromosome segregation during mitosis. Loss of cohesion very possibly triggers sister separation at the metaphase --> anaphase transition. This process depends on the destruction of anaphase inhibitory proteins like Pds1p (Cut2p), which is thought to liberate a sister-separating protein Esp1p (Cut1p). By looking for mutants that separate sister centromeres in the presence of Pds1p, this and a previous study have identified six proteins essential for establishing or maintaining sister chromatid cohesion. Four of these proteins, Scc1p, Scc3p, Smc1p, and Smc3p, are subunits of a 'Cohesin' complex that binds chromosomes from late G1 until the onset of anaphase. The fifth protein, Scc2p, is not a stoichiometric Cohesin subunit but it is required for Cohesin's association with chromosomes. The sixth protein, Eco1p(Ctf7p), is not a Cohesin subunit. It is necessary for the establishment of cohesion during DNA replication but not for its maintenance during G2 and M phases.

Ability to reproduce is one of the hallmark features of all life forms by which new organisms are produced from their progenitors. During this process each cell duplicates its genome and passes a copy of its genome to the daughter cells along with the cellular matrix. Unlike bacteria, in eukaryotes there is a definite time gap between when the genome is duplicated and when it is physically separated. Therefore, for precise halving of the duplicated genome into two, it is required that each pair of duplicated chromosomes, termed sister chromatids, should be paired together in a binary fashion from the moment they are generated. This pairing function between the duplicated genome is primarily provided by a multimeric protein complex, called cohesin. Thus, genome integrity largely depends on cohesin as it ensures faithful chromosome segregation by holding the sister chromatids glued together from S phase to anaphase. In this review, we have discussed the life cycle of cohesin during both mitotic and meiotic cell divisions including the structure and architecture of cohesin complex, relevance of cohesin associated proteins, mechanism of cohesin loading onto the chromatin, cohesion establishment and the mechanism of cohesin disassembly during anaphase to separate the sister chromatids. We have also focused on the role of posttranslational modifications in cohesin biology. For better understanding of the complexity of the cohesin regulatory network to the readers, we have presented an interactome profiling of cohesin core subunits in budding yeast during mitosis and meiosis.
