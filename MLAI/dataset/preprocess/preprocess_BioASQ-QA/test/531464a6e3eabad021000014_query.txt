Mutation of which gene is associated with McLeod syndrome?

[PMID: 11099667]
Kx is lacking in the RBCs of patients with the McLeod syndrome. This condition is sometimes associated with chronic granulomatous disease (CGD). If given allogeneic RBCs, CGD patients with the McLeod phenotype may produce anti-Kx and anti-Km, and only phenotypically matched McLeod blood would be compatible. McLeod phenotype persons without CGD have made anti-Km but not anti-Kx (2 examples), and thus both McLeod and K(O) blood would be compatible. RBCs from a transfused patient with the McLeod phenotype but not with CGD (non-CGD McLeod) were typed for the Kell blood group antigens, and the plasma was analyzed for the presence of antibody by agglutination. The molecular basis was determined by analyzing for XK protein on RBC membranes by Western immunoblotting, by sequencing the XK gene, and by RFLP. The RBCs did not react with anti-Kx + anti-Km and showed weakening of Kell system antigens. The patient's plasma reacted moderately (2+) with RBCs of common Kell type and strongly (4+) with K(O) RBCs and RBCs of common Kell type treated with dithiothreitol, and did not react with McLeod RBCs. XK protein was absent from the RBC membranes. The XK gene had a point mutation in the donor splice site of intron 1 (G>C). This is the first report describing the molecular alteration in a non-CGD McLeod patient who has made anti-Kx. The immune response of people with the McLeod phenotype can vary, and K(O) blood may not always be compatible.

McLeod syndrome is caused by mutations of XK, an X-chromosomal gene of unknown function. Originally defined as a peculiar Kell blood group variant, the disease affects multiple organs, including the nervous system, but is certainly underdiagnosed. We analyzed the mutations and clinical findings of 22 affected men, aged 27 to 72 years. Fifteen different XK mutations were found, nine of which were novel, including the one of the eponymous case McLeod. Their common result is predicted absence or truncation of the XK protein. All patients showed elevated levels of muscle creatine phosphokinase, but clinical myopathy was less common. A peripheral neuropathy with areflexia was found in all but 2 patients. The central nervous system was affected in 15 patients, as obvious from the occurrence of seizures, cognitive impairment, psychopathology, and choreatic movements. Neuroimaging emphasized the particular involvement of the basal ganglia, which was also detected in 1 asymptomatic young patient. Most features develop with age, mainly after the fourth decade. The resemblance of McLeod syndrome with Huntington's disease and with autosomal recessive chorea-acanthocytosis suggests that the corresponding proteins--XK, huntingtin, and chorein--might belong to a common pathway, the dysfunction of which causes degeneration of the basal ganglia.

Very few human genes can be used to identify spontaneous inactivating somatic mutations. We hypothesized that because the XK gene is X-linked, it would be easy to identify spontaneously arising red cells with a phenotype resembling the McLeod syndrome, which results from inherited XK mutations. Here, by flow cytometry, we detect such phenotypic variants at a median frequency of 9 x 10(-6) in neonatal cord blood samples and 39 x 10(-6) in healthy adults (p=0.004). It may be possible to further investigate the relationship between aging, mutations, and cancer using this approach.

The McLeod syndrome is an X-linked neuroacanthocytosis manifesting with myopathy and progressive chorea. It is caused by mutations of the XK gene encoding the XK protein, a putative membrane transport protein of yet unknown function. In erythroid tissues, XK forms a functional complex with the Kell glycoprotein. Here, we present an immunohistochemical study in skeletal muscle of normal controls and a McLeod patient with a XK gene point mutation (C977T) using affinity-purified antibodies against XK and Kell proteins. Histological examination of the affected muscle revealed the typical pattern of McLeod myopathy including type 2 fiber atrophy. In control muscles, Kell immunohistochemistry stained sarcoplasmic membranes. XK immunohistochemistry resulted in a type 2 fiber-specific intracellular staining that was most probably confined to the sarcoplasmic reticulum. In contrast, there was only a weak background signal without a specific staining pattern for XK and Kell in the McLeod muscle. Our results demonstrate that the lack of physiological XK expression correlates to the type 2 fiber atrophy in McLeod myopathy, and suggest that the XK protein represents a crucial factor for the maintenance of normal muscle structure and function.

McLeod syndrome, characterized by acanthocytosis and the absence of a red-blood-cell Kell antigen (Kx), is a multisystem disorder involving a late-onset myopathy, splenomegaly, and neurological defects. The locus for this syndrome has been mapped, by deletion analysis, to a region between the loci for Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) and chronic granulomatous disease (CGD). In this study, we describe a new marker, 3BH/R 0.3 (DXS 709), isolated by cloning the deletion breakpoint of a DMD patient. A long-range restriction map of Xp21, encompassing the gene loci for McLeod and CGD, was constructed, and multiple CpG islands were found clustered in a 700-kb region. Using the new marker, we have limited the McLeod syndrome critical region to 150-380-kb. Within this interval, two CpG-rich islands which may represent candidate sites for the McLeod gene were identified.

Neuroacanthocytosis (NA) refers to a group of heterogenous, rare genetic disorders, namely chorea acanthocytosis (ChAc), McLeod syndrome (MLS), Huntington's disease-like 2 (HDL2) and pantothenate kinase associated neurodegeneration (PKAN), that mainly affect the basal ganglia and are associated with similar neurological symptoms. PKAN is also assigned to a group of rare neurodegenerative diseases, known as NBIA (neurodegeneration with brain iron accumulation), associated with iron accumulation in the basal ganglia and progressive movement disorder. Acanthocytosis, the occurrence of misshaped erythrocytes with thorny protrusions, is frequently observed in ChAc and MLS patients but less prevalent in PKAN (about 10%) and HDL2 patients. The pathological factors that lead to the formation of the acanthocytic red blood cell shape are currently unknown. The aim of this study was to determine whether NA/NBIA acanthocytes differ in their functionality from normal erythrocytes. Several flow-cytometry-based assays were applied to test the physiological responses of the plasma membrane, namely drug-induced endocytosis, phosphatidylserine exposure and calcium uptake upon treatment with lysophosphatidic acid. ChAc red cell samples clearly showed a reduced response in drug-induced endovesiculation, lysophosphatidic acid-induced phosphatidylserine exposure, and calcium uptake. Impaired responses were also observed in acanthocyte-positive NBIA (PKAN) red cells but not in patient cells without shape abnormalities. These data suggest an "acanthocytic state" of the red cell where alterations in functional and interdependent membrane properties arise together with an acanthocytic cell shape. Further elucidation of the aberrant molecular mechanisms that cause this acanthocytic state may possibly help to evaluate the pathological pathways leading to neurodegeneration.

We report the first case of McLeod syndrome (MLS) in a 47-year-old Chinese man who presented with progressive limb weakness, chorea of feet, red blood cell acanthocytosis, absence of Kx red blood cell antigen and weak expression of Kell antigens. The diagnosis of MLS was confirmed by genetic testing showing a hemizygous mutation of XK gene. We review literature on neuroacanthocytosis in the Chinese population.

The McLeod phenotype is derived from various forms of XK gene defects that result in the absence of XK protein, and is defined hematologically by the absence of Kx antigen, weakening of Kell system antigens, and red cell acanthocytosis. Individuals with the McLeod phenotype usually develop late-onset neuromuscular abnormalities known as the McLeod syndrome (MLS). MLS is an X-linked multi-system disorder caused by absence of XK alone, or when the disorder is caused by large deletions, it may be accompanied with Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD), chronic granulomatous disease (CYBB), retinitis pigmentosa (RPGR), and ornithine transcarbamylase deficiency (OTC). XK defects derived from a large deletion at the XK locus (Xp21.1) have not been characterized at the molecular level. In this study, the deletion breakpoints of two novel cases of McLeod phenotype with extensive deletions are reported. Case 1 has greater than 1.12 million base-pairs (mb) deletion around the XK locus with 7 genes affected. Case 2 has greater than 5.65 mb deletion from TCTE1L to DMD encompassing 20 genes. Phylogenetic analyses demonstrated that DMD, XK and CYBB have close paralogs, some of which may partially substitute for the functions of their counterparts. The loci around XK are highly conserved from fish to human; however, the disorders are probably specific to mammals, and may coincide with the translocation of the loci to the X chromosome after the speciation in birds. The non-synonymous to synonymous nucleotide substitution rate ratio (omega=dN/dS) in these genes was examined. CYBB and RPGR show evidence of positive selection, whereas DMD, XK and OTC are subject to selective constraint.

Neuroacanthocytosis syndromes are mainly comprised of two diseases: chorea-acanthocytosis (ChAc) and McLeod syndrome (MLS). There is a high incidence of psychiatric disorders such as mood disorder and schizophrenia among neuroacanthocytosis patients. We hypothesized that neuroacanthocytosis-related-genes might be associated with susceptibility to these psychiatric disorders. We performed a comprehensive mutation screen of VPS13A and XK, the gene responsible for ChAc and MLS, respectively, in 85 mood disorder subjects and XK in 86 schizophrenia subjects and compared the variants to 100 or more control alleles. We also performed copy number variation (CNV) analysis in 72 mood disorder subjects and 86 schizophrenia subjects. We identified three non-synonymous, two synonymous and six intron variants in mood disorder subjects and a novel GAT triplet repeat polymorphism in VPS13A. By CNV analysis, we identified a heterozygous exon 60-61 deletion in VPS13A in one mood disorder subject. We identified one non-synonymous and one intron variant in mood disorder and schizophrenia subjects, respectively, in XK. The presence of a pathogenic mutation or a potentially functional variant in mood disorder or schizophrenia subjects suggests that neuroacanthocytosis-related-genes might be involved in the pathogenesis of these psychiatric disorders.

A 34-year-old male, son of consanguineous parents, had a progressive neurological illness characterized by seizures, tics, choreic movements and mood changes. Acanthocytosis was present in blood. The level of creatine kinase was elevated. Normobetalipoproteinemia was noted. No KX group changes of McLeod syndrome were found. Serial neuroimaging studies demonstrated progressive caudate atrophy. Muscular biopsy confirmed the existence of non-specific myopathy. Genetic study demonstrated homozigosity for the 9q21 region.

McLeod Syndrome (MLS) is a rare X-linked disorder characterized by haemopoietic abnormalities and late-onset neurological and muscular defects. The McLeod blood group phenotype is typically associated with erythrocyte acanthocytosis, absence of the Kx antigen and reduced expression of Kell system antigens. MLS is caused by hemizygosity for mutations in the XK gene. We describe a patient with MLS who first showed symptoms in 1989 (aged 51 years). As the disease progressed, the patient developed a slight dementia, aggressive behaviour and choreatic movements. A cardiomyopathy was also diagnosed. An electroneuromyography showed neuropathic and myopathic changes. Liver enzymes were elevated and a blood smear showed acanthocytes. MLS was confirmed by serological analysis of the Kell antigens. Analysis of red blood cells by flow cytometry revealed the patient and his grandson to have reduced Kell antigen expression. The patient's daughters had two populations of red cells, consistent with them being heterozygous for an XK0 allele. The molecular basis of MLS in this family is a novel mutation consisting of a 7453-bp deletion that includes exon 2 of the XK gene. This confirms that the patient's 7-year-old grandson, who is currently asymptomatic, also has the XK0 allele and is therefore likely to develop MLS.

McLeod syndrome is an X-linked multisystem disorder characterized by abnormalities in the neuromuscular and hematopoietic systems. We have assembled a cosmid contig of 360 kb that encompasses the McLeod gene locus. A 50 kb deletion was detected by screening DNA from patients with radiolabeled whole cosmids, and two transcription units were identified within this deletion. The mRNA expression pattern of one of them, designated as XK, correlates closely to the McLeod phenotype. XK encodes a novel protein with structural characteristics of prokaryotic and eukaryotic membrane transport proteins. Nucleotide sequence analysis of XK from two unrelated McLeod patients has identified point mutations at conserved splice donor and acceptor sites. These findings provide direct evidence that XK is responsible for McLeod syndrome.

Neurological abnormalities associated with spiculated, "acanthocytic" red cells in blood have been described as neuroacanthocytosis. This is a heterogeneous group of conditions that can be clearly subdivided on the basis of recent genetic findings. The McLeod Syndrome, one of the core neuroacanthocytosis syndromes, is a rare X-linked disorder caused by mutations of the XK gene, an X-chromosomal gene of unknown function characterized by haemopoietic abnormalities and late-onset neurological and muscular defects. We report two Chilean brothers with the McLeod phenotype who showed important psychiatric features. The diagnosis may be elusive if the presence of acanthocytosis is not properly studied. We describe a method which allowed the diagnosis that unmasked acanthocytosis. Otherwise the condition could have remained undiagnosed as it had been for decades in this family. This syndrome must be considered when assessing a familial movement disorder, specially affecting males with relevant psychiatric features. A reliable test for acanthocytosis assessment is available.

The X-linked McLeod neuroacanthocytosis syndrome strongly resembles Huntington's disease and has been reported in various countries world-wide. Herein, we report two Chilean brothers with predominant psychiatric features at disease onset including schizophrenia-like psychosis and obsessive compulsive disorder. Molecular genetic analysis revealed a small deletion in the XK gene (938-942delCTCTA), which has been already described in a North American patient of Anglo-Saxon descent and a Japanese family, presenting with seizures, muscle atrophy or chorea yet absence of psychiatric features. These findings argue against a founder effect and indicate a profound phenotypic variability associated with the 938-942delCTCTA deletion. Our report supports the inclusion of McLeod syndrome in the differential diagnosis of Huntington's disease as well as acute psychosis in male subjects.

McLeod syndrome and chorea-acanthocytosis are classified with the so-called neuroacanthocytosis group of syndromes. Both lead to progressive basal ganglia degeneration and were not easily distinguished in the past. With the discovery of their molecular bases, mutations of the X-linked gene XK and autosomal recessive mutations of the gene coding for chorein, respectively, the two phenotypes can now be differentiated and extend the diagnostic spectrum in patients presenting with chorea. The present review compares the two conditions and proposes a practical approach to diagnosis and treatment. Better-defined disease concepts should eventually replace the umbrella term of "neuroacanthocytosis." Animal models are needed to understand the underlying mechanisms. A final common pathway is likely for the pathogenesis of these conditions and is most probably shared with Huntington's disease.

The McLeod syndrome is a rare X-linked recessive disorder characterized by blood group, neuromuscular and haematopoietic abnormalities. It is caused by XK gene defects and may include large deletions in the Xp21 region. Analysis of three unrelated McLeod patients for the presence of the XK, DMD, CYBB, ETX1, RPGR and OTC loci, as well as for the DXS709 marker, revealed deletions from the 39th exon of DMD to the ETX1 locus (patient Be), from the XK to RPGR loci (patient Bi) and from the XK to CYBB loci (patient Lh). All three patients normally expressed the Lutheran (Lu) red cell antigens, thus excluding the interval between the RPGR and DMD genes as site of the XS locus, previously mapped to the Xp21.2-Xq21.1 region and thought to regulate the expression of the LU blood group gene on chromosome 19.

In a patient suffering from X-linked chronic granulomatous disease (X-CGD)--a disorder of phagocytesuperoxide generation--and McLeod syndrome, characterized by the absence of the red cell Kell antigen, we identified a deletion of the entire X-CGD gene by means of DNA hybridization with a cDNA probe. Our findings suggest that the X-CGD and McLeod loci are physically close in the p21 region of the X chromosome proximal to the Duchenne muscular dystrophy locus.

Kell antigens are encoded by the KEL gene on the long arm of chromosome 7. Kx antigen is encoded by the XK gene on the short arm of the X chromosome. Kell and Kx proteins in the red cell membrane are covalently linked by a disulphide bond. The McLeod phenotype is characterized by weakened expression of antigens in the Kell blood group system, absence of Km and Kx antigens, and acanthocytosis. It has an X-linked mode of inheritance with transmission through carrier females. Some males with the McLeod syndrome also have chronic granulomatous disease (CGD). It is generally believed that patients with non-CGD McLeod may develop anti-Km but not anti-Kx, but that those with CGD McLeod can develop both anti-Km and anti-Kx. We present serological data, DNA genotyping and gene sequencing, monocyte monolayer assay and neutrophil oxidative burst test from a patient with the McLeod phenotype without clinical evidence of CGD. We report here the second example of a patient with non-CGD McLeod who developed anti-Kx in addition to anti-Km. Sequencing of our patient's XK gene confirmed the presence of a mutation resulting in a premature stop codon and lack of Kx protein in the red cell membrane, which is consistent with the diagnosis of McLeod syndrome. Neutrophil oxidative burst test was normal, indicating that our patient did not have CGD. The challenge of providing 10 compatible blood units for multiple surgeries was met. The second case of a rare entity, a patient with non-CGD McLeod who developed anti-Kx and anti-Km, was managed successfully with a combination of autologous donations and procurement of compatible units from national and international sources.

The authors describe a family with six patients with muscular dystrophy with a variable course. One is a compound heterozygote for CAPN3 mutations (calpainopathy) and the others have a single CAPN3 mutation. Linkage analysis and sequencing revealed a XK gene mutation (McLeod syndrome). This illustrates the variable phenotype of XK mutations and suggests the possibility that CAPN3 heterozygotes may have their condition caused by nonallelic mutations in other unrelated genes.

A 45-year-old man developed chorea, behavioural changes, moderate amyotrophy and polyneuropathy. Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy and increased serum lactate dehydrogenase and creatine kinase (CK) were found. Acanthocytes were not detected. The absence of XK protein and faintly expressed Kell antigens on erythrocytes were found. Genetic test revealed a R133X mutation of the XK gene, confirming the McLeod syndrome. After 7 years he suddenly developed delirium followed by severe hypoglycaemia, hyperthermia, rhabdomyolysis, hepatic and renal failure. Malignant arrhythmia caused death.

McLeod syndrome is a rare X-linked hematologic and neuromuscular disorder manifested by chorea, myopathy, cardiomyopathy, areflexia, hyperCKemia, and acanthocytosis. Only four mutations have been reported in the gene responsible for McLeod syndrome. We report a novel gene mutation in a Japanese family. Direct sequencing of the PCR-amplified genomic DNA revealed the mutation was a single C-nucleotide insertion at codon 151 in exon 2 of the XK gene, which resulted in a 3'-frameshift. Study of family members revealed that the patient's mother was a manifesting carrier heterozygous for this mutation.

X-linked retinitis pigmentosa (XLRP) is characterized by retinal degeneration with night blindness and progressive reduction of the visual fields. By linkage and deletion analysis a gene locus (RP3) has been mapped to the short arm of the X chromosome between the genes CYBB and OTC. Analysis of transcript in this region has revealed a gene which is abundantly expressed in human retina and encodes a putative membrane protein with significant homologies to short consensus repeat (SCR/sushi) domains known from selections and complement proteins. The gene termed SRPX (sushi-repeat-containing protein, x chromosome) is deleted in an RP patient who also suffers from chronic granulomatous disease and McLeod syndrome. A 75 kb deletion removing exon 1 of the gene was also found in two brothers of a second XLRP family. However, no further functionally significant mutations were detected by SSCP screening of all 10 exons in 34 unrelated XLRP patients nor by full length RT-PCR sequencing in two RP3 families. The role of this highly conserved retinal gene in the pathogenesis of RP therefore remains to be determined.

We report a novel mutation in the XK gene (XK) in a Japanese patient with McLeod syndrome. A 50-year-old man showed progressive muscular atrophy, choreic movement, elevated level of serum creatinine kinase, and acanthocytosis. The expression level of all the Kell antigens in erythrocyte was decreased and molecular analysis revealed a single-base (T) deletion at the nucleotide position 1095 in XK. This deletion caused a frameshift in translation, leading to a premature stop codon at the amino acid position 408. We conclude this single-base deletion causes defective Kx protein, which is responsible for the McLeod phenotype in this patient.

McLeod syndrome is a rare X-linked neuroacanthocytosis syndrome with hematologic, muscular, and neurologic manifestations. McLeod syndrome is caused by mutations in the XK gene whose product is expressed at the red blood cell (RBC) surface but whose function is currently unknown. A variety of XK mutations has been reported but no clear phenotype-genotype correlation has been found, especially for the point mutations affecting splicing sites. A man suspected of neuroacanthocytosis was evaluated by neurologic examination, electromyography, muscle biopsy, muscle computed tomography, and cerebral magnetic resonance imaging. The McLeod RBC phenotype was disclosed by blood smear and immunohematology analyses and then confirmed at the biochemical level by Western blot analysis. The responsible XK mutation was characterized at the mRNA level by reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (PCR), identified by genomic DNA sequencing, and verified by allele-specific PCR. A novel XK splice site mutation (IVS1-1G>A) has been identified in a McLeod patient who has developed hematologic, neuromuscular, and neurologic symptoms. This is the first reported example of a XK point mutation affecting the 3' acceptor splice site of Intron 1, and it was demonstrated that this mutation indeed induces aberrant splicing of XK RNA and lack of XK protein at the RBC membrane. The detailed characterization at the molecular biology level of this novel XK splice site mutation associated with the clinical description of the patient contributes to a better understanding of the phenotype-genotype correlation in the McLeod syndrome.

Mutations in genes for any of the six subunits of NADPH oxidase cause chronic granulomatous disease (CGD), but almost 2/3 of CGD cases are caused by mutations in the X-linked CYBB gene, also known as NAD (P) H oxidase 2. Approximately 260 patients with CGD have been reported in Japan, of whom 92 were shown to have mutations of the CYBB gene and 16 to have chromosomal deletions. However, there has been very little detailed analysis of the range of the deletion or close understanding of the disease based on this. We therefore analyzed genomic rearrangements in X-linked CGD using array comparative genomic hybridization analysis, revealing the extent and the types of the deletion genes. The subjects were five Japanese X-linked CGD patients estimated to have large base deletions of 1 kb or more in the CYBB gene (four male patients, one female patient) and the mothers of four of those patients. The five Japanese patients were found to range from a patient exhibiting deletions only of the CYBB gene to a female patient exhibiting an extensive DNA deletion and the DMD and CGD phenotype manifested. Of the other three patients, two exhibited CYBB, XK, and DYNLT3 gene deletions. The remaining patient exhibited both a deletion encompassing DNA subsequent to the CYBB region following intron 2 and the DYNLT3 gene and a complex copy number variation involving the insertion of an inverted duplication of a region from the centromere side of DYNLT3 into the deleted region.

The X-linked McLeod neuroacanthocytosis syndrome is a multisystem disorder with hematologic, neuromuscular, and central nervous system (CNS) manifestations. All carriers of the McLeod blood group phenotype examined so far had at least subclinical signs of systemic involvement. Evaluation of two brothers carrying the McLeod phenotype with neurologic examination, immunohematology, RBC membrane protein Western blotting, analysis of XK DNA sequence and RNA levels, muscle histology including XK/Kell immunohistochemistry, cerebral magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), and quantified positron emission tomography (PET). Immunohematology and Western blotting confirmed presence of the McLeod blood group phenotype. No acanthocytosis or other hematologic anomalies were found. XK gene sequence analysis revealed a missense mutation in exon 3 (E327K). WBC XK RNA levels were not decreased. There were no neuromuscular and CNS signs or symptoms. In addition, no subclinical involvement was discovered on the basis of normal muscle histology with a physiologic pattern of XK and Kell immunohistochemistry, normal cerebral MRI, and quantified PET. Known disease-causing XK gene mutations comprised deletions, nonsense, or splice-site mutations predicting absent or truncated XK protein devoid of the Kell-protein binding site. Although the E327K missense mutation was associated with the immunohematologic characteristics of McLeod syndrome, the mutated XK protein seemed to be largely functional. These findings contribute to the understanding of the physiology of XK and Kell proteins, and the pathogenetic mechanisms of acanthocytosis, myopathy, and striatal neurodegeneration in McLeod syndrome.

Among the movement disorders associated with acanthocytosis, McLeod syndrome (McKusick 314850) is the one that is best characterized on the molecular level. Its defining feature is low reactivity of Kell erythrocyte antigens. This is due to absence of membrane protein KX that forms a complex with the Kell protein. KX is coded for by the XK gene on the X-chromosome. We present six males (aged 29 to 60 years), with proven XK mutations, to discuss the chorea associated with McLeod syndrome. The movement disorder commonly develops in the fifth decade and is progressive. It affects the limbs, the trunk and the face. In addition to facial grimacing, involuntary vocalization can be present. In early stages there may only be some restlessness or slight involuntary distal movements of ankles and fingers. Lip-biting and facial tics seem more common in autosomal recessive choreoacanthocytosis linked to chromosome 9. This, together with the absence of dysphagia in McLeod syndrome, may help in differential diagnosis. Recent findings suggest a role for the endothelin system of the striatum in the pathogenesis of McLeod syndrome.

A 29-year-old man with a history of elevated creatine kinase and necrotizing myopathy was reviewed. Prominent red cell acanthocytosis in association with reduced Kell antigen expression was present, findings consistent with the McLeod syndrome. Investigation of the patient's XK gene revealed a novel TGG- to-TAG transition at position 1023 in exon 3. This point mutation creates an in-frame stop codon (W314X), and predicts a truncated XK protein of 313 amino acids, compared with 444 amino acids in the normal XK protein. The mutation was not identified in the patient's mother or sister indicating that this mutation was spontaneous.

This study investigates the effects of XKR4, a recently identified candidate gene for Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD), birth weight, and their interaction on brain volume in ADHD. XKR4 is expressed in cerebellum and low birth weight has been associated both with changes in cerebellum and with ADHD, probably due to its relation with prenatal adversity. Anatomical MRI scans were acquired in 58 children with ADHD and 64 typically developing controls and processed to obtain volumes of cerebrum, cerebellum and gray and white matter in each structure. DNA was collected from saliva. Analyses including data on birth weight were conducted in a subset of 37 children with ADHD and 51 controls where these data were retrospectively collected using questionnaires. There was an interaction between genotype and birth weight for cerebellum gray matter volume (p = .020). The combination of homozygosity for the G-allele (the allele previously found to be overtransmitted in ADHD) and higher birth weight was associated with smaller volume. Furthermore, birth weight was positively associated with cerebellar white matter volume in controls, but not ADHD (interaction: p = .021). The interaction of genotype with birth weight affecting cerebellum gray matter is consistent with models that emphasize increased influence of genetic risk-factors in an otherwise favorable prenatal environment. The absence of an association between birth weight and cerebellum white matter volume in ADHD suggests that other genetic or environmental effects may be at play, unrelated to XKR4. These results underscore the importance of considering environmental effects in imaging genetics studies.

A 50-year-old man presented with worsening, virtually lifelong, chorea and progressive behavioural disturbance, involving disinhibition and hoarding, over 10 years. Clinical assessment revealed chorea, dysarthria, areflexia, an inappropriately jovial, impulsive manner and neuropsychological evidence of frontosubcortical dysfunction. Investigation results included an elevated creatine kinase, caudate atrophy and hypoperfusion, acanthocytes in the peripheral blood and the McLeod phenotype. DNA studies demonstrated a single-base deletion at position 172 in exon 1 of the XK gene, giving rise to a premature stop codon at position 129 in exon 2.

Loss-of-function mutations in the gene ced-8 lead to the late appearance of cell corpses during embryonic development in C. elegans. ced-8 functions downstream of or in parallel to-the regulatory cell death gene ced-9 and may function as a cell death effector downstream of the caspase encoded by the programmed cell death killer gene ced-3. In ced-8 mutants, embryonic programmed cell death probably initiates normally but proceeds slowly. ced-8 encodes a transmembrane protein that appears to be localized to the plasma membrane. The CED-8 protein is similar to human XK, a putative membrane transport protein implicated in McLeod Syndrome, a form of hereditary neuroacanthocytosis.

McLeod syndrome is an X-linked recessive disorder, characterized by neuromuscular and hematopoietic dysfunction. Two cases of McLeod syndrome were reported in a family with neuroacanthocytosis and, remarkably, 1 of them was female. Direct sequence analysis of the McLeod gene in 12 members of the family revealed a novel point mutation in exon 2 that creates a frameshift and results in premature termination of translation. There was marked skewing of X inactivation in the severely affected female.

The McLeod syndrome is an X-linked disorder caused by mutations of the XK gene encoding the XK protein. The syndrome is characterized by absent Kx erythrocyte antigen, weak expression of Kell blood group system antigens, and acanthocytosis. In some allelic variants, elevated creatine kinase, myopathy, neurogenic muscle atrophy, and progressive chorea are found. We describe a family with a novel point mutation in the XK gene consisting of a C to T base transition at nucleotide position 977, introducing a stop codon. Among seven affected males, five manifested with psychiatric disorders such as depression, bipolar disorder, or personality disorder, but only two presented with chorea Positron emission tomography and magnetic resonance volumetry revealed reduced striatal 2-fluoro-2-deoxy-glucose (FDG) uptake and diminished volumes of the caudate nucleus and putamen that correlated with disease duration. In contrast, none of 12 female mutation carriers showed psychiatric or movement disorders. However, a semidominant effect of the mutation was suggested by erythrocyte and blood group mosaicism and reduced striatal FDG uptake without structural abnormalities. Therefore, patients with psychiatric signs or symptoms segregating in an X-linked trait should be examined for acanthocytosis and Kell/Kx blood group serology.

McLeod neuroacanthocytosis syndrome is a late-onset X-linked multisystem disorder affecting the peripheral and central nervous systems, red blood cells (RBCs), and internal organs. A variety of mutations have been found in the responsible gene (XK) including single nonsense and missense mutations, nucleotide mutations at or near the splice junctions of introns of XK, and different deletion mutations. To date no clear phenotype-genotype correlation is apparent. The clinical details of one case of McLeod phenotype without apparent neuromuscular abnormalities have been reported. Here the clinical details of two additional cases are presented, of which the genetic details have previously been published. Two asymptomatic or minimally symptomatic cases at ages expected to manifest the McLeod syndrome (MLS) were evaluated. The first case had been authenticated as a genuine McLeod both by serology and by genotyping (R222G missense mutation) and the second case had a mutation in XK (IVS2+5G>A) and by serology exhibited very weak Kx antigen and no detectable Kell antigens, except extremely low k antigen by adsorption-elution technique. The patients were examined for hematologic, neurologic, and other clinical abnormalities. Despite documented McLeod phenotype on RBCs, and identified mutations of XK, neurologic and other clinical findings were minimal at ages expected to manifest MLS. The different XK mutations may have different effects upon the XK gene product and thus may account for the variable phenotype.
