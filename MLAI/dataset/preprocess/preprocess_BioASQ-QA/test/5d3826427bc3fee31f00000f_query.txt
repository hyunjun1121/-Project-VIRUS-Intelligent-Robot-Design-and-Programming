<b><i>Background</i>:</b> The aim of this study was to build nomograms to predict local recurrence (LR) and regional recurrence (RR) in patients with nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC) underwent intensity-modulated radiation therapy (IMRT). <b><i>Patients and Methods</i></b> : A total of 1811 patients with non-metastatic NPC treated with IMRT (with or without chemotherapy) between October 2009 and February 2012 at our center were involved for building the nomograms. Nomograms for LR-free rate and RR-free rate at 3- and 5- year were generated as visualizations of Cox proportional hazards regression models, and validated using bootstrap resampling, estimating discrimination and calibration. <b><i>Results</i>:</b> With a median follow up of 49.50 months, the 3- and 5- year LR-free rate were 95.43% and 94.30% respectively; the 3- and 5- year RR-free rate were 95.94% and 95.41% respectively. The final predictive model for LR included age, the neutrophil/leukocyte ratio (NWR), pathological type, primary gross tumor volume, maxillary sinus invasion, ethmoidal sinus invasion and lacerated foramen invasion; the model for RR involved NWR, plasma Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) DNA copy number, cervical lymph node volume and N category. The models showed fairly good discriminatory ability with concordance indices (c-indices) of 0.76 and 0.74 for predicting LR and RR, respectively, as well as good calibration. The proposed stratification of risk groups based on the nomograms allowed significant distinction between Kaplan-Meier curves for LR and RR. <b><i>Conclusions</i>:</b> The proposed nomograms resulted in more-accurate prognostic prediction for LR and RR with a high concordance, hence to inform patients with high risk of recurrence on more aggressive therapy. The prognostic nomograms could better stratify patients into different risk groups.

The study was designed to appraise the locoregional recurrence patterns using conventional two-dimensional radiotherapy (2D-RT) and intensity modulated radiation therapy (IMRT) in nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC) in order to better establish the scenario of the modern radiotherapy and the duration of surveillance. We reviewed the institutional database to identify patients with pathologically confirmed, non-metastatic NPC who completed radical 2D-RT or IMRT at our center from 2000 to 2011. We collected data on clinicopathologic features, treatments and outcomes. Statistical analyses were performed using SPSS 20.0 or STATASE 14.0. The median follow-up was 60.1 months. Of 2315 patients, 1289 (53%) were treated with 2D-RT and 1026 (47%) with IMRT. IMRT group achieved better locoregional control rate, with the 5-year locoregional relapse-free survival (LRRFS) were 84.9% and 87.7% among patients received 2D-RT and IMRT, respectively (P = 0.050). IMRT was superior to 2D technique in terms of local relapse-free survival (LRFS) (88.4% vs 91.1%, P = 0.047) and the advantage was only significant in T3-4 subgroup (81.6% vs 90.2%, P = 0.000). Similar neck control rates were observed using different RT techniques. And the recurrence time appeared to be postponed by IMRT, with peaks accounting for the year 1.5 and year 3-4 compared to which was predominant at the first two years using 2D-RT in nature. IMRT provided an improved LRRFS in overall stage and LRFS in advanced T stage for NPC compared with 2D-RT. Annual hazard of recurrence also changed with RT techniques.

To date, there are no serum biomarkers available for the prediction of recurrent nasopharyngeal carcinoma (rNPC). The diagnosis of rNPC mostly depends on imaging and biopsy of diseased tissue; however, both of these methods work mostly if the target tumor is at an advanced stage. Therefore, the identificaqtion of recurrent biomarkers is urgently required. In the present study, we used tandem mass tag (TMT) labeling and high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) fractionation followed by liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC‑MS/MS) to identify differentially expressed proteins. Serum was collected from 40 patients with NPC [recurrence (n=20) and no recurrence (n=20)]. Compared to non‑recurrent NPC (nrNPC), we found 59 proteins to be significantly dysregulated in rNPC; most of these have been previously reported to play a role in carcinogenesis. The dysregulation of calmodulin (CALM) was confirmed in 74 new patients [recurrence (n=32) and no recurrence (n=42)] by ELISA. Moreover, we performed a preliminary pathway analysis which revealed that oxidative phosphorylation was altered in the patients with rNPC compared to those with nrNPC. Taken together, these data identify a potential diagnostic biomarker for rNPC and elucidate the potential molecular mechanisms that are dysregulated and contribute to the pathogenesis of rNPC.

Tumor recurrence is a major cause of nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC) treatment failure. Diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI) is used for a variety of cancers, but few data are available for NPC.The aim of the study was to investigate the DWI features of recurrent NPC after radiotherapy and apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) thresholds for the diagnosis of recurrent NPC.This was a retrospective study of 160 patients with NPC treated by radiotherapy at the Cancer Hospital affiliated to Guangxi Medical University from May 2012 to March 2015. The patients were divided into the local recurrence (n = 39), fibrosis (n = 51), clivus recurrence (n = 22), and clivus nonrecurrence (n = 48) groups. The patients underwent magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), enhanced MRI, and DWI. Receiver operating characteristics curves were used to determine sensitivity, specificity, and negative predictive values.ADC values were significantly different between the recurrence and fibrosis groups (P < .0001). Using ADC threshold values of 0.887 × 10 mm/s for local recurrence, the area under the curve (AUC) of DWI was 0.967 (87.2% sensitivity and 94.1% specificity), compared with 0.732 for routine MRI (71.8% sensitivity and 74.5% specificity) (P < .001). Using ADC threshold values of 1.018 × 10 mm/s for the diagnosis of clivus recurrent NPC, the AUC of DWI was 0.984 (95.5% sensitivity and 91.7% specificity) compared with 0.558 for routine MRI (63.6% sensitivity and 47.9% specificity) (P < .001).DWI has a higher diagnostic value for recurrent NPC than MRI. DWI can increase the diagnosis sensitivity and specificity of locally recurrent NPC.

This study reported our experience of the clinical characteristics of periparotid recurrence of nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC) after parotid-gland-sparing radiotherapy. We retrospectively reviewed the charts of 296 patients with NPC who underwent parotid-gland-sparing radiotherapy at the Tri-Service General Hospital from 1998 to 2008. Eighty-three patients underwent three-dimensional conformal radiotherapy, and 205 patients underwent intensity-modulated radiotherapy; parotid glands were spared bilaterally in all patients. None of these patients had undergone previous radiotherapy or surgical treatment of the head and neck. Disease recurred in a spared parotid gland in three patients (1.04%). Two of these patients had undergone three-dimensional conformal radiotherapy and the third underwent intensity-modulated radiotherapy. All three patients had undergone parotidectomy. Adjuvant radiotherapy or concurrent chemoradiation was administered. One patient died of metastatic disease 26 months after diagnosis of recurrence; the others were well with no evidence of disease at 63 and 6 months after initial recurrence. Periparotid recurrence is an uncommon pattern of locoregional failure after parotid-gland-sparing radiotherapy for NPC. Early diagnosis and aggressive therapy for patients with periparotid recurrence may improve outcomes.

An important challenge in nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC) research is to develop effective predictors of tumor recurrence following treatment to determine whether immediate adjuvant therapy is necessary. We retrospectively analyzed archived specimens collected from 45 patients with paired samples of primary NPC (pNPC) and recurrent NPC (rNPC). Clinical samples were collected from the Cancer Center Databases of the First People's Hospital of Foshan and Shantou Central Hospital (affiliates of Sun Yat-Sen University) between 2001 and 2012. Expression levels of phosphor-Stat3 (p-Stat3), signalosome complex subunit 5 (Jab1/Csn5), Akt1, C/EBP homologous protein (CHOP), Ki-67, and apoptosis were determined by immunohistochemistry in pNPC and rNPC samples from the same patients. Differences in these markers between the short-term interval to recurrence (ITR) group (ITR <18 months) and long-term ITR group (ITR ≥18 months) were further analyzed. In Cox's regression analysis, the ITR was significantly associated as an independent‑negative prognostic factor for overall survival (hazard ratio, 0.211; 95% confidence interval, 0.053-0.841; P=0.027). p-Stat3 was increased in the short-term ITR group (ITR <18 months) and tended to be lower in the long-term ITR group (ITR ≥18 months). In the short-term ITR group, nuclear Akt expression was significantly increased in paired rNPC (P=0.028). In the long-term ITR group, the expression of nuclear Jab1/Csn5 (P=0.047) and assessment of apoptosis measured with TdT-mediated dUTP nick end‑labeling (TUNEL) (P=0.003) was significantly increased in paired rNPC. The results suggest that differences between short- and long-term ITR may predict outcome in rNPC. Furthermore, the overexpression of Jab1/Csn5 and Akt may contribute to the carcinogenesis of rNPC, and Akt seems to promote the progression of short-term ITR. Intra-individual changes of Jab1/Csn5, Akt, and TUNEL may help to identify short-term ITR.

One of the malignant tumors among head and neck cancers is nasopharyngeal carcinoma. Many studies consider human papilloma virus (HPV) as a cause for nasopharyngeal carcinoma. 41 paraffin-wax-embedded block samples were examined to detect HPV DNA and its subtype's presence by polymerase chain reaction. The recurrence, prognosis and survival were evaluated for an average of 48 months. HPV DNA was positive in 9 patients (22%). The overall recurrence rate was 75% in HPV negative patients and 11% in HPV positive ones. The mortality rate in HPV negative and positive patients was 37.5% and 0%, respectively. HPV type 18 and 16 were the most common subtypes. Also, it can be implied that patients which are HPV positive had better prognosis and also less recurrence.
