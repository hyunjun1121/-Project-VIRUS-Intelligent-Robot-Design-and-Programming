Which syndrome is caused by pathogenic COL4A3-COL4A5 variants?

[PMID: 34245817]
Massively parallel sequencing identifies pathogenic variants in the genes affected in Alport syndrome (COL4A3-COL4A5) in as many as 30% of individuals with focal and segmental glomerulosclerosis (FSGS), 10% of those with kidney failure of unknown cause, and 20% with familial immunoglobulin A (IgA) glomerulonephritis. FSGS associated with COL4A3-COL4A5 variants is usually present by the onset of kidney failure and may develop because the abnormal glomerular membranes result in podocyte loss and secondary hyperfiltration. The association of COL4A3-COL4A5 variants with kidney failure or IgA glomerulonephritis may be coincidental. However, pathogenic variants in these conditions occur more often than they should by chance, which suggests that the variants are disease-causing. COL4A3-COL4A5 variants are also found in cystic kidney diseases after autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease has been excluded. COL4A3-COL4A5 variants should be suspected in individuals with FSGS, kidney failure of unknown cause, or familial IgA glomerulonephritis, especially where there is persistent hematuria and a family history of hematuria or kidney failure.

The reported prevalence of Alport syndrome varies from one in 5000 to one in 53,000 individuals. This study estimated the frequencies of predicted pathogenic <i>COL4A3-COL4A5</i> variants in sequencing databases of populations without known kidney disease. Predicted pathogenic variants were identified using filtering steps based on the ACMG/AMP criteria, which considered collagen IV <i>α</i>3-<i>α</i>5 position 1 Gly to be critical domains. The population frequencies of predicted pathogenic <i>COL4A3-COL4A5</i> variants were then determined per mean number of sequenced alleles. Population frequencies for compound heterozygous and digenic combinations were calculated from the results for heterozygous variants. <i>COL4A3-COL4A5</i> variants resulting in position 1 Gly substitutions were confirmed to be associated with hematuria (for each, <i>P</i><0.001). Predicted pathogenic <i>COL4A5</i> variants were found in at least one in 2320 individuals. p.(Gly624Asp) represented nearly half (16 of 33, 48%) of the variants in Europeans. Most <i>COL4A5</i> variants (54 of 59, 92%) had a biochemical feature that potentially mitigated the clinical effect. The predicted pathogenic heterozygous <i>COL4A3</i> and <i>COL4A4</i> variants affected one in 106 of the population, consistent with the finding of thin basement membrane nephropathy in normal donor kidney biopsy specimens. Predicted pathogenic compound heterozygous variants occurred in one in 88,866 individuals, and digenic variants in at least one in 44,793. The population frequencies for Alport syndrome are suggested by the frequencies of predicted pathogenic <i>COL4A3-COL4A5</i> variants, but must be adjusted for the disease penetrance of individual variants and for the likelihood of already diagnosed disease and non-Gly substitutions. Disease penetrance may depend on other genetic and environmental factors.
