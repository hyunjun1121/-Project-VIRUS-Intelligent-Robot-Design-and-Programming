Where are integrins localized in a cell?

The extracellular domain of plasma membrane integrin αvβ3 contains a cell surface receptor for thyroid hormone analogues. The receptor is largely expressed and activated in tumor cells and rapidly dividing endothelial cells. The principal ligand for this receptor is l-thyroxine (T<sub>4</sub>), usually regarded only as a prohormone for 3,5,3'-triiodo-l-thyronine (T<sub>3</sub>), the hormone analogue that expresses thyroid hormone in the cell nucleus via nuclear receptors that are unrelated structurally to integrin αvβ3. At the integrin receptor for thyroid hormone, T<sub>4</sub> regulates cancer and endothelial cell division, tumor cell defense pathways (such as anti-apoptosis), and angiogenesis and supports metastasis, radioresistance, and chemoresistance. The molecular mechanisms involve signal transduction via mitogen-activated protein kinase and phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase, differential expression of multiple genes related to the listed cell processes, and regulation of activities of other cell surface proteins, such as vascular growth factor receptors. Tetraiodothyroacetic acid (tetrac) is derived from T<sub>4</sub> and competes with binding of T<sub>4</sub> to the integrin. In the absence of T<sub>4</sub>, tetrac and chemically modified tetrac also have anticancer effects that culminate in altered gene transcription. Tumor xenografts are arrested by unmodified and chemically modified tetrac. The receptor requires further characterization in terms of contributions to nonmalignant cells, such as platelets and phagocytes. The integrin αvβ3 receptor for thyroid hormone offers a large panel of cellular actions that are relevant to cancer biology and that may be regulated by tetrac derivatives.

Integrins are transmembrane glycoproteins that are broadly distributed in living organisms. As a heterodimer, they contain an α and a β subunit, which are reported to be associated with various physiological and pathological processes. In the present study, a 2502 bp full-length cDNA sequence of Bmintegrin β1 was obtained from the silkworm, Bombyx mori. Bmintegrin β1 belongs to the β subunit of the integrin family and contains several typical structures of integrins. Gene expression profile analysis demonstrated that Bmintegrin β1 was ubiquitously expressed in all tested tissues and organs, with the maximum expression levels in fat body and hemocytes. The immunofluorescence results showed that Bmintegrin β1 was located in the cell membrane and widely distributed in fat bodies and different types of hemocytes. Bmintegrin β1 expression was remarkably increased after challenging with different kinds of bacteria and pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs). Further investigation revealed that Bmintegrin β1 could participate in the agglutination of pathogenic bacteria possibly through direct binding with the relative bacteria and PAMPs. Altogether, this study provides a novel insight into the immune functional features of Bmintegrin β1.
