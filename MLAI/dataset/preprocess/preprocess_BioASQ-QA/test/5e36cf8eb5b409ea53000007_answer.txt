IDEAL_ANSWER:
- Haematopoietic stem and progenitor cells (HSPCs) require a specific microenvironment to grow and are protected from ultraviolet-light-induced DNA damages by melanocytes. Mutations that lack melanocytes have normal steady-state haem atopoiesis under standard laboratory conditions while melanocytes above the stem cell niche protect HSPCs against ultraviolet- light-induced damage.
- Melanocytes protect Haematopoietic stem and progenitor cells (HSPCs) from ultraviolet-light-induced DNA damages in aquatic vertebrates.
- Haematopoietic stem and progenitor cells (HSPCs) require a specific microenvironment, the haematopoietic niche, which regulates HSPC behaviour. A melanocyte umbrella above the kidney marrow protects HSPCs against ultraviolet light in zebrafish. The umbrella of melanocytes associated with the haematopoietic niche is highly evolutionarily conserved in aquatic animals, including the sea lamprey, a basal vertebrate. During the transition from an aquatic to a terrestrial environment, HSPCs relocated into the bone marrow, which is protected from ultraviolet light by the cortical bone around the marrow. The melanocytes above the haematopoietic niche protect HSPCs from ultraviolet-light-induced DNA damage in aquatic vertebrates and during the transition to terrestrial life, ultraviolet light was an evolutionary pressure affecting the location of the haematopoietic niche.
