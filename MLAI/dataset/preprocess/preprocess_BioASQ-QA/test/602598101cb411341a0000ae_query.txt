The progress in the understanding of the pathophysiology of rheumatic diseases provided a rational basis for the development of biologic disease‑modifying antirheumatic drugs (bDMARDs) and targeted synthetic DMARDs (tsDMARDs), which have completely revolutionized the treatment of inflammatory conditions. These agents differ in terms of their effectiveness for controlling specific rheumatic diseases depending on the pivotal cytokine driving the inflammatory process. Cytokine blockers were the first to be developed and rapidly expanded. They include agents that act against tumor necrosis factor α (TNF‑α) (etanercept, infliximab, adalimumab, golimumab, and certolizumab pegol) and interleukin (IL) 6 (tocilizumab and sarilumab), IL‑1 (anakinra, canakinumab, and rilonacept), IL‑17 (secukinumab and ixekizumab), and IL-12/23 (ustekinumab) receptors. Lymphocyte‑targeting agents include rituximab and belimumab, which act against B cells by different mechanisms, and abatacept, which is a T cell costimulation modulator. tsDMARDs, also known as small‑molecule inhibitors, are oral drugs based on a novel strategy to treat inflammatory diseases. Janus kinase (JAK) inhibitors (tofacitinib, baricitinib, and upadacitinib) and phosphodiesterase 4 inhibitors (apremilast) form this group. The major concern with the use of bDMARDs and tsDMARDs is a higher risk of infections. Performance of blood tests as well as screening for tuberculosis and hepatitis viral infection are mandatory prior to biologic therapy initiation. Adherence to an immunization program is also recommended. Whenever possible, the choice of bDMARDs and tsDMARDs should be guided by the patient's comorbidities. There have been limited data on the use of these drugs during pregnancy, but anti‑TNF‑α therapy, rituximab, and anakinra seem to be safe. Biologic agents are expensive, but biosimilars have emerged as a cost‑effective option with a potential to treat a greater number of patients.

Many biological disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs (bDMARDs) and targeted synthetic DMARDs (tsDMARDs) are currently available as treatment options for rheumatoid arthritis (RA), but a subset of RA patients shows inadequate responses to any of these DMARDs. This phenomenon, which we call super-resistance, is becoming a serious concern. In this study, I present two cases of super-resistant RA in which patients failed to respond to treatment with bDMARDs of any class as well as to tsDMARD therapy with tofacitinib. In these cases, leukocytapheresis (LCAP), a treatment that removes overabundant leukocytes from the body, rapidly induced low disease activity and made patients subsequently responsive to previously ineffective DMARDs. My experience with the present cases suggests that LCAP is worth considering as an alternative therapeutic option for the management of RA patients with super-resistance to DMARD therapies.

In recent years tremendous progress has been made in the therapeutic management of rheumatoid arthritis. Rheumatologists now have a large armamentarium of highly efficient drugs with different mechanisms of action at their disposal. These new drugs consist of biologicals (biological disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs, bDMARDs) as well as targeted synthetic DMARDs (tsDMARD). A common feature of these new drugs for treatment of rheumatoid arthritis is that the molecular target of the drug is known, which is not the case for conventional DMARDs. With the help of the new drugs, the therapeutic goal of inducing remission in patients with rheumatoid arthritis has become reality for many patients. Nevertheless, there is still a significant proportion of patients who do not adequately respond to all available drugs, leaving room for still further improvement. This review gives a short overview on the currently available and effective substances for the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis.

To provide real-world evidence about the reasons why Australian rheumatologists cease biologic (b) and targeted synthetic (ts) disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs (DMARD) when treating patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA), and to assess (1) the primary failure rate for first-line treatment, and (2) the persistence on second-line treatments in patients who stopped first-line tumor necrosis factor inhibitors (TNFi). This is a multicenter retrospective, noninterventional study of patients with RA enrolled in the Australian Optimising Patient outcome in Australian RheumatoLogy (OPAL) dataset with a start date of b/tsDMARD between August 1, 2010, and June 30, 2017. Primary failure was defined as stopping treatment within 6 months of treatment initiation. Data from 7740 patients were analyzed; 6914 patients received first-line b/tsDMARD. First-line treatment was stopped in 3383 (49%) patients; 1263 (37%) were classified as primary failures. The most common reason was "lack of efficacy" (947/2656, 36%). Of the patients who stopped first-line TNFi, 43% (1111/2560) received second-line TNFi, which resulted in the shortest median time to stopping second-line treatment (11 months, 95% CI 9-12) compared with non-TNFi. The longest second-line median treatment duration after first-line TNFi was for patients receiving rituximab (39 months, 95% CI 27-74). A large proportion of patients who stopped first-line TNFi therapy received another TNFi despite evidence for longer treatment persistence on second-line b/tsDMARD with a different mode of action. Lack of efficacy was recorded as the most common reason for making a switch in first-line treatment of patients with RA.

Despite the significant progress in Rheumatoid Arthritis (RA) therapeutics, there are several reports in the literature claiming that the size of unmet needs in RA is large. In the era before biologics, there was indeed a significant number of patients who did not achieve low disease activity (LDA) or disease remission due to limited therapeutic choices in the doctors' armamentarium. Treatment wise, great progress has been achieved over the last decades with the discovery and introduction in therapeutics of new molecules, such as the biological (b) disease-modifying anti-rheumatic drugs (DMARDs), and the targeted synthetic (ts) DMARDs. Today, with such a plethora of conventional synthetic (cs) DMARDs, tsDMARDs, and bDMARDs, why are we unable to successfully treat RA patients? What is wrong? However, a new drug for RA does not mean it is necessary to switch to a new treatment. It is very easy to change and switch therapies when the patient complains about pain and stiffness. In this setting, it is obligatory to rule out other comorbidities and disorders that may be the cause of the pain first. Thus, clinicians must have a deep knowledge of the drug therapy and be able to adjust the treatment when needed. A minute clinical examination must be carried out on every visit with close monitoring of the patient. A treat-to-target (T2T) approach and the application of the American College of Rheumatology/European League Against Rheumatism (ACR/EULAR) recommendations and strategies should minimize the unmet needs.

The treatment of rheumatoid arthritis (RA) has been transformed with the introduction of biologic disease modifying anti-rheumatic drugs (bDMARD) and more recently, targeted synthetic DMARD (tsDMARD) therapies in the form of janus-kinase inhibitors. Nevertheless, response to these agents varies such that a trial and error approach is adopted; leading to poor patient quality of life, and long-term outcomes. There is thus an urgent need to identify effective biomarkers to guide treatment selection. A wealth of research has been invested in this field but with minimal progress. Increasingly recognized is the importance of evaluating synovial tissue, the primary site of RA, as opposed to peripheral blood-based investigation. In this mini-review, we summarize the literature supporting synovial tissue heterogeneity, the conceptual basis for stratified therapy. This includes recognition of distinct synovial pathobiological subtypes and associated molecular pathways. We also review synovial tissue studies that have been conducted to evaluate the effect of individual bDMARD and tsDMARD on the cellular and molecular characteristics, with a view to identifying tissue predictors of response. Initial observations are being brought into the clinical trial landscape with stratified biopsy trials to validate toward implementation. Furthermore, development of tissue based omics technology holds still more promise in advancing our understanding of disease processes and guiding future drug selection.

Despite recommendations suggesting that biological and targeted synthetic disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs (b/tsDMARDs) should be used in combination with methotrexate in the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis (RA), up to one-third of patients with RA are treated with monotherapy. The objective of the systematic literature review reported here was to evaluate the clinical evidence regarding the efficacy of b/tsDMARDs as monotherapy in the treatment of RA. MEDLINE<sup>®</sup>, Embase<sup>®</sup>, and the Cochrane Central Trials Register (to April 11, 2017) and the American College of Rheumatology and European League Against Rheumatism conference proceedings (2010-2016) were searched for randomized controlled trials evaluating the efficacy of b/tsDMARDs as monotherapy for RA in adults. Forty-four monotherapy studies of abatacept, adalimumab, baricitinib, certolizumab pegol, etanercept, sarilumab, sirukumab, tocilizumab, and tofacitinib reported in 71 publications were identified. Tocilizumab had the most studies (14), followed by etanercept (10) and adalimumab (9). These b/tsDMARDs were consistently shown to be efficacious treatments, regardless of whether patients were intolerant of or had never used conventional synthetic (cs) DMARDs. However, better treatment outcomes were usually achieved with combination therapy, and this was observed for all b/tsDMARDs assessed by this review. Only a few studies provided a head-to-head comparison between b/tsDMARD treatments or between b/tsDMARD monotherapy and combination therapy, and as many were initial RA treatments they were not generalizable to usual care. In conclusion, evidence from randomized trials suggests that the b/tsDMARDs studied are effective as monotherapy. In general, some patient responses seem better with combination therapy and the durability of monotherapy is less than combination therapy. There is, however, a need for longer-term head-to-head trials to establish positioning of these interventions in the treatment algorithm for RA.

Management and therapy of rheumatoid arthritis (RA) has been revolutionized by the development and approval of the first biological disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs (bDMARDs) targeting tumor necrosis factor (TNF) α at the end of the last century. Today, numerous efficacious agents with different modes of action are available and achievement of clinical remission or, at least, low disease activity is the target of therapy. Early therapeutic interventions aiming at a defined goal of therapy (treat to target) are supposed to halt inflammation, improving symptoms and signs, and preserving structural integrity of the joints in RA. Up to now, bDMARDs approved for therapy in RA include agents with five different modes of action: TNF inhibition, T cell co-stimulation blockade, IL-6 receptor inhibition, B cell depletion, and interleukin 1 inhibition. Furthermore, targeted synthetic DMARDs (tsDMARDs) inhibiting Janus kinase (JAK) and biosimilars also are approved for RA. The present review focuses on bDMARDs and tsDMARDS regarding similarities and possible drug-specific advantages in the treatment of RA. Furthermore, compounds not yet approved in RA and biosimilars are discussed. Following the American College of Rheumatology (ACR) and European League Against Rheumatism (EULAR) recommendations, specific treatment of the disease will be discussed with respect to safety and efficacy. In particular, we discuss the question of favoring specific bDMARDs or tsDMARDs in the two settings of insufficient response to methotrexate and to the first bDMARD, respectively.

Abatacept, a biologic DMARD, was associated with respiratory adverse events in a small subgroup of RA patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) in a trial. Whether this potential risk is specific to abatacept or extends to all biologics and targeted synthetic DMARDs (tsDMARDs) is unclear. We assessed the risk of adverse respiratory events associated with biologic and tsDMARDs compared with conventional synthetic DMARDs (csDMARDs) among RA patients with concomitant COPD in a large, real-world cohort. We used a prevalent new-user design to study RA patients with COPD in the US-based MarketScan databases. New users of biologic DMARDs and/or tsDMARDs were matched on time-conditional propensity scores to new users of csDMARDs. Adverse respiratory events were estimated using Cox models comparing current use of biologic/tsDMARDs with csDMARDs. The cohort included 7424 patients initiating biologic/tsDMARDs and 7424 matched patients initiating csDMARDs. The adjusted hazard ratio of hospitalized COPD exacerbation comparing biologic/tsDMARD vs csDMARD was 0.76 (95% CI: 0.55, 1.06), while it was 1.02 (95% CI: 0.82, 1.27) for bronchitis, 1.21 (95% CI: 0.92, 1.58) for hospitalized pneumonia or influenza and 0.99 (95% CI: 0.87, 1.12) for outpatient pneumonia or influenza. The hazard ratio of the combined end point of COPD exacerbation, bronchitis and hospitalized pneumonia or influenza was 1.04 (95% CI: 0.89, 1.21). In this large, real-world comparative safety study, biologic and tsDMARDs, including abatacept, were not associated with an increased risk of adverse respiratory events when compared with csDMARDs in patients with RA and COPD.

Fatigue is a common and debilitating symptom in patients with RA. Since 2007, fatigue has been included as one of the core outcome measures in RA. Clinical trials of biologic DMARDs (bDMARDs) and targeted synthetic DMARDs (tsDMARDs) have included fatigue as a secondary endpoint. A Cochrane review in 2016 concluded that the bDMARDs have a moderate effect on improving fatigue in RA. More recent clinical trials of the new biologic agent sarilumab and the Janus kinase inhibitors tofacitinib and baricitinib showed similar benefits. It remains unclear whether the effect of bDMARDs and tsDMARDs on fatigue is mediated by direct effects or through a reduction in inflammation. As fatigue was a secondary endpoint, many analyses did not adjust for potential confounding factors, including pain, mood and anaemia, which is a significant limitation.

Recent advance in treatment of rheumatoid arthritis (RA) has been derived by biological disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs (bDMARDs) targeting cytokines. A Jak inhibitor tofacitinib, the first drug of targeted synthetic DMARD (tsDMARD), a novel category of DMARD, shows similar efficacy profile, but different safety concerns, compared to bDMARDs. It is, therefore, essential to understand the mode of action of tofacitinib in the context of safety and efficacy. We here document the possible mechanism of tofacitinib in patiens with RA, shedding light upon a characteristic adverse event, herpes zoster.
