As many as 80% of patients with asthma suffer from allergic rhinitis (AR), and rhinitis symptoms are associated with sleep complaints The aim of this cross-sectional study was to assess the prevalence of obstructive sleep apnea syndrome risk in patients with asthma and to explore the association between comorbid rhinitis and obstructive sleep apnea syndrome risk. Subjects with asthma were recruited by general practitioners during a control visit. Physicians compiled a questionnaire that assessed the presence of AR according to ARIA (Allergic Rhinitis and Its Impact on Asthma) guidelines and factors influencing the risk of obstructive sleep apnea syndrome (gastroesophageal reflux disease, obesity, smoking). Subjects completed a questionnaire evaluating the presence and severity of AR and the STOP-BANG questionnaire (snoring, tiredness during daytime, observed apnea, high blood pressure, body mass index, age, neck circumference, gender), a validated screening method to identify obstructive sleep apnea syndrome risk. Physicians were blinded to the subjects' questionnaires, ensuring objectivity of the method. The analyses were conducted on 1,941 subjects (males 58%, mean age 48.2 ± 15.2 y): 740 with asthma alone and 1,201 with asthma and AR. STOP-BANG revealed that 52.6% of the subjects were at increased risk of obstructive sleep apnea syndrome: 47.3% of subjects with asthma alone and 55.9% of patients with asthma and AR. Rhinitis was associated with a 1.44 times higher odds ratio for having obstructive sleep apnea syndrome risk. Rhinitis duration and severity were associated with obstructive sleep apnea syndrome risk, although the latter deserved greater importance. The results showed that, once a correction for each of these factors was performed, subjects with AR with an odds ratio of 1.99 were reported to be at risk of obstructive sleep apnea syndrome. The probable increased risk of obstructive sleep apnea syndrome is associated with the concomitant presence of rhinitis, independent of obesity and other contributors to risk of obstructive sleep apnea syndrome.

Obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) is a sleep-related breathing disorder that is underdiagnosed. OSA is usually diagnosed by polysomnography (PSG) and, if untreated, could lead to life-threatening complications. Many screening questionnaires have been developed to screen and identify patients at high risk for OSA. This study aimed to evaluate and validate the Arabic version of Stop-Bang questionnaire as a screening tool for patients with OSA symptoms referred to a sleep clinic. All referred Arabic-speaking adult patients presenting to a Sleep Disorders Specialized Clinic in Al Ain for PSG were requested to complete an Arabic STOP-Bang questionnaire. A score of 3 or more out of a possible 8 was taken to indicate high risk for presence of OSA. These scores were then evaluated versus results from the overnight, monitored PSG. Apnea/hypopnea index (AHI) of ≥5/h was considered for diagnosis of OSA. One hundred ninety-three sleep clinic patients were enrolled in this study. PSG was positive (AHI ≥5) in 85 % of the studied population. STOP-Bang questionnaire was positive (≥3) in 87 % of the population. Reproducibility of STOP-Bang questionnaire was tested, and the intraclass correlation coefficient of the total score of STOP-Bang questionnaire was 0.931 (95 % CI 0.834-0.972). The sensitivities of the STOP-Bang screening tool for an AHI of ≥5, ≥15, and ≥30 were 90, 96.75, and 99.70 %, respectively, with negative predictive values (NPVs) of 36, 84, and 92 %, respectively. ROC curve was 0.77. The Arabic version of STOP-Bang questionnaire is an easy-to-use tool that can be implemented as a reliable, quick screening tool for OSA in patients referred to sleep clinic. It demonstrated high sensitivity and NPV especially for patients with moderate to severe OSA. We believe that this tool will help physicians to earlier identify cases at risk of OSA.

Background. The STOP-BANG questionnaire has been used to identify surgical patients at risk for undiagnosed obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) by classifying patients as low risk (LR) if STOP-BANG score < 3 or high risk (HR) if STOP-BANG score ≥ 3. Few studies have examined whether postoperative complications are increased in HR patients and none have been described in oncologic patients. Objective. This retrospective study examined if HR patients experience increased complications evidenced by an increased length of stay (LOS) in the postanesthesia care unit (PACU). Methods. We retrospectively measured LOS and the frequency of oxygen desaturation (<93%) in cancer patients who were given the STOP-BANG questionnaire prior to cystoscopy for urologic disease in an ambulatory surgery center. Results. The majority of patients in our study were men (77.7%), over the age of 50 (90.1%), and had BMI < 30 kg/m(2) (88.4%). STOP-BANG results were obtained on 404 patients. Cumulative incidence of the time to discharge between HR and the LR groups was plotted. By 8 hours, LR patients showed a higher cumulative probability of being discharged early (80% versus 74%, P = 0.008). Conclusions. Urologic oncology patients at HR for OSA based on the STOP-BANG questionnaire were less likely to be discharged early from the PACU compared to LR patients.

An accurate, clinical screening tool for obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) that identifies patients for further diagnostic testing would assist in the diagnosis of this comorbidity. One example, the STOP-BANG questionnaire (SBQ), has been validated as a screening tool with high sensitivity. However, its specificity may result in a high false-positive rate. The aim of this study to determine if addition of the Modified Mallampati score to the SBQ improves its specificity. The authors studied 162 patients referred to the Sleep Disorders Clinic at Yedikule Chest Disease Education and Research Hospital. All patients were prospectively screened for risk of OSA using the SBQ, their oral anatomy was assessed by Modified Mallampati scoring, and sleep quality characterized by polysomnography. Polysomnography results were reviewed when available and the predictive performance of the SBQ and the modified SBQ scoring models were compared. In the authors' study an SBQ score ≥3 yielded sensitivities of 0.85, 0.86, and 0.91 for Apnea-Hypopnea Index (AHI) ≥5/h, AHI ≥15/h, and AHI ≥30/h, respectively, and specificities of 0.09, 0.10, and 0.18. The modified SBQ with a cutoff of ≥4 (>3) points for AHI levels of >5, >15, and >30 yielded respective sensitivities of 0.84, 0.86, and 0.91 and specificities of 0.25, 0.26, and 0.27. The author's results from indicated the modified SBQ with a cutoff of >3 points in this study was more specific than the standard SBQ but no less sensitive, and may be used in identifying OSA patients for further diagnostic evaluation or avoiding unnecessary testing.

Patients with epilepsy and obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) are at risk for worsened seizure control and quality of life. We performed a quality improvement project, evaluating for improvements in the screening of OSA in epilepsy patients using the STOP-BANG questionnaire. The electronic medical records of patients seen in our epilepsy clinic were screened for 4 months prior to the intervention. We subsequently implemented the STOP-BANG questionnaire for 3 months. Only 22/664 patients (3.3%) had their sleeping habits explored during the pre-intervention period; 11 (1.7%) were referred to sleep medicine. Following implementation of the STOP-BANG questionnaire, the percentage of patients screened for OSA increased to 41.6% (269/647, Chi-square Fisher's Exact test 2-sided p<0.001). Of the 269 patients screened, 84 (31.2%) met criteria for elevated OSA risk. Forty-one patients were referred to sleep medicine during the subsequent 3 month period, including 33 who met STOP-BANG criteria for OSA. This represented 6.3% and 5.1% (respectively) of all 647 patients, a significant improvement over the percentage referred prior to the intervention (Chi-square Fisher's Exact test 2-sided p<0.001). Twelve of the 33 patients referred based on the STOP-BANG questionnaire saw sleep medicine; 11 (91.7%) were referred for polysomnography (PSG). Of the 10 patients who underwent PSG, 9 (90%) were diagnosed with OSA and offered treatment with continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP).

Screening methods have become increasingly important owing to the growing number of patients suspected of obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) being referred for sleep consultation. The STOP-Bang questionnaire has been validated as a screening tool for OSA in surgical patients. To evaluate the performance of a Portuguese version of the STOP-Bang questionnaire for the diagnosis of OSA in a sleep clinic. Prospectively, for 2 months, all patients referred to our clinic for clinical evaluation completed a translated version of the STOP-Bang questionnaire in Portuguese and underwent a sleep study. We observed 216 patients and 215 (99.5%) were included. Age was 53.63±13.10 years, 63.3% were male patients, neck circumference was 40.4±44.11 cm and BMI was 29.41 [26.85; 33.06] kg/m(2). OSA was present in 78% of the patients, of whom, 33% had moderate and 37% had severe OSA. A STOP-Bang score ≥3 had a sensitivity and positive predictive value (PPV) for OSA of 93.4% and 86.6%, respectively. Each increase in the STOP-Bang score was associated with an increase in the probability of OSA and severe OSA; reaching a 95% OSA probability, for a score of 6, and a 73% severe OSA probability, for a score of 8. A score of 3 and 2 had a negative predictive value for moderate/severe OSA of 85.3% and 91.7%, respectively. The STOP-Bang questionnaire showed high sensitivity and PPV for OSA with the probability of severe OSA steadily increasing, the higher the scores. Furthermore, a low score showed high predictive value for the exclusion of moderate/severe OSA. The STOP-Bang questionnaire can be a powerful tool for stratifying patients in the diagnosis of OSA.

This study aimed to compare the efficiency of the STOP-BANG and Berlin Obstructive Sleep Apnoea Syndrome questionnaires for evaluating potential respiratory complications during the perioperative period. Questionnaires that are used to determine obstructive sleep apnoea risk are not widely used for surgical patients. Among the questionnaires that are commonly used for obstructive sleep apnoea screening, it remains unclear whether the STOP-BANG or Berlin Obstructive Sleep Apnoea Syndrome questionnaire is more effective in terms of ease of use, usage period and diagnosis of surgical patients with obstructive sleep apnoea risk. This study was designed as a descriptive and prospective study. The study included 126 patients over 18 years of age who were American Society of Anesthesiologists classification class I-II and underwent laparoscopic cholecystectomy. To determine the potential obstructive sleep apnoea syndrome risk, the STOP-BANG and Berlin questionnaires were administered. Respiratory complications were then observed during the perioperative period. During intubation and extubation, we observed statistically significant differences in difficult intubation, difficult facemask ventilation and desaturation frequency between the high- and low-risk groups for obstructive sleep apnoea syndrome, as determined by the STOP-BANG questionnaire. During extubation, statistically significant differences in coughing, breath-holding and desaturation frequency were observed between the high-risk and low-risk groups, according to the Berlin questionnaire. In the post-anaesthesia care unit, both questionnaires found statistically significant differences between the low- and high-risk groups. Obstructive sleep apnoea syndrome screening questionnaires administered during the preoperative period are useful for predicting perioperative respiratory complications. It may be most useful to administer the STOP-BANG questionnaire as the initial evaluation. Questionnaires may be used to determine the risk of obstructive sleep apnoea syndrome, which could impact the anaesthetisation of surgical patients. Questionnaires for determining the risk of obstructive sleep apnoea syndrome should be used regularly for surgical patients, and these questionnaires should be used to improve clinical protocols for anaesthesia and postanaesthesia care.

The aims of this study were to (1) explore the incidence of right-sided heart dysfunction (RHD) and STOP-Bang questionnaire responses consistent with obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) and (2) assess the relationship between patients with STOP-Bang questionnaire responses consistent with OSA and echocardiographic findings suggestive of RHD. Observational study. Tertiary academic center preoperative clinic. Two hundred patients presenting for elective surgery to the University of Utah preoperative clinic. Abbreviated transthoracic right-sided echocardiogram and STOP-Bang questionnaire. Tricuspid annular plane systolic excursion, tissue Doppler-derived tricuspid lateral annular systolic velocity (S'), and the tricuspid inflow E wave to tricuspid annular tissue Doppler e' wave ratio (E/e') for the presence of RHD, as well as responses to STOP-Bang questionnaire. A total of 140 echocardiograms were analyzed after exclusion of participants with incomplete STOP-Bang questionnaires and inadequate images. Thirty-five patients (25%) reported 5 or more positive responses to the STOP-Bang questionnaire. Forty-six patients (35%) had abnormal right-sided heart measurements. Of the 35 patients with STOP-Bang scores 5 or greater, 11 (31%) had evidence of RHD. No correlation was observed between STOP-Bang scores and the echocardiography metrics of RHD. This preliminary study suggests that there are numerous sources of RHD, among one of which is sleep apnea, and/or the STOP-Bang questionnaire is not a sensitive tool for predicting RHD. We conclude that although the STOP-Bang questionnaire is easy to implement in a preoperative clinical setting, it is not useful in identifying patients at risk for RHD.

To determine if a high score (≥ 3) on the STOP-Bang screening questionnaire for obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) predicts whether obese patients are at high risk for OSA and increased risk of difficult airway. Prospective, questionnaire-based clinical assessment. University-affiliated hospital. 127 ASA physical status 2 and 3 patients, who were scheduled for elective bariatric surgery. Patients were allocated to three groups. Group 1 patients had a previous history of OSA, Group 2 patients had no history of OSA but did have a high STOP-Bang score (≥ 3), and Group 3 patients had no history of OSA but did have a low STOP-Bang score (< 3). Groups 2 and 3 only were assessed using the STOP-Bang questionnaire. After induction and intubation of the patient, an anesthesiologist who was blinded to the three study group allocations completed an airway questionnaire on the three study groups. The frequency of difficult airway, difficult mask ventilation with or without muscle relaxation, poor visualization of the vocal cords, difficulty in blade insertion, and difficult intubation were compared. The group of patients with high STOP-Bang scores (Group 2) and those patients previously diagnosed with OSA (Group1) showed a higher risk for difficult airway than the patients with low STOP-Bang scores (Group 3; P < 0.001). The STOP-Bang score may be used as an effective predictor of difficult airway in obese patients. Obese surgical patients with unknown/undiagnosed OSA status should be evaluated using the STOP-Bang questionnaire score.

A close relationship between obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) and difficult intubation has been suggested. We hypothesized that the STOP-Bang questionnaire, a screening tool for obstructive sleep apnea (OSA), can predict difficult intubation. In this prospective cohort study, 200 adult surgical patients undergoing surgery under general anesthesia were studied to evaluate the usefulness of the STOP-Bang questionnaire for predicting difficult intubation. STOP-Bang questionnaire results, Mallampati score and tonsil size, as well as demographic data, were recorded preoperatively. Cormack & Lehane grading and difficulty of intubation (Cormack & Lehane grade III or IV, need of an intubation aid, or need of three or more intubation attempts) were also evaluated. Eighty-three out of 200 patients had a high risk of OSA based on the STOP-Bang questionnaire. The occurrence of difficult intubation was higher in the patients at a high risk of OSA (i.e., a STOP-Bang score of ≥ 3) than in the patients at a low risk (13.3% vs. 2.6%) (p = 0.004). Higher age, greater weight, higher body mass index, greater neck circumference, male gender, presence of comorbidities, lower preoperative SpO2, longer extubation times, higher Mallampati score, higher Cormack & Lehane grading, tonsil size and difficult intubation were significantly correlated with a high risk of OSA (p < 0.001). Fourteen out of 200 patients had difficulty in intubation. A STOP-Bang score of ≥ 3 was seen more frequently in the difficult intubation patients (78.6% vs. 38.7%) (p = 0.009). Greater weight, greater neck circumference, greater Mallampati score, a STOP-Bang score ≥ 3 and male gender were significantly correlated with difficult intubation (p < 0.05). A STOP-Bang score of ≥ 3 was a predictor for difficult intubation.

The present study validates and evaluates the sensitivity and specificity of four internationally popular questionnaires, translated into Chinese, for assessing suspected obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) patients, namely, the Berlin questionnaire, the ASA checklist, the STOP questionnaire and the STOP-BANG questionnaire. Their predictive values in OSA risks in patients presenting with OSA symptoms are examined. Questionnaires may be helpful in prioritizing polysomnography (PSG) and in treatment for the more severe cases. All patients attending our sleep laboratory for overnight PSG were recruited. They were asked to complete three questionnaires (Berlin, ASA checklist and STOP) 2 weeks before and on the same night as the PSG. STOP-BANG questionnaire, an extended STOP with demographic data, 'B'-body mass index (BMI), 'A'-age, 'N'-neck circumference and 'G'-gender was completed by our technologists using the patient's completed STOP. A number of 141 patients were recruited. The sensitivities and specificities for STOP-BANG with cutoffs at PSG's RDI=5, RDI=15 and RDI=30 were 81% to 86% and 34% to 57%, respectively. The high-risk group patients identified by STOP-BANG had significantly higher respiratory disturbance index and lower minimum oxygen saturation than the low-risk group patients. Among the four questionnaires studied, STOP-BANG, with only eight questions and the highest sensitivity, is the best questionnaire of the four for OSA screening. This can potentially assist in prioritizing PSG and can be helpful in clinical or self-evaluation by the general public.

Sleep apnea (SA) has emerged as a potent risk factor for stroke recurrence and mortality. The burden of SA among stroke survivors in sub-Saharan Africa where stroke incidence and mortality are escalating is unknown. We sought to assess the prevalence of SA risk and its clinical correlates and predictors among Ghanaian stroke survivors. This cross-sectional study involved 200 consecutive stroke survivors attending a neurology clinic in a tertiary medical center in Kumasi, Ghana. The validated Berlin, STOP-BANG, and Epworth Sleepiness Scale questionnaires were administered to all eligible subjects to assess SA risk and daytime somnolence, and their demographic and clinical information, health-related quality of life, and symptoms of depression were collected using the questionnaires. The median (interquartile range) age of stroke survivors was 62 (52-72) years and 52.5% were male. Ninety-nine (49.5%) subjects were identified as high risk for SA using the Berlin questionnaire, whereas 26 (13%), 137 (68.5%), and 37 (18.5%) subjects were classified as low, intermediate, and high risk for SA, respectively, using the STOP-BANG questionnaire. Patients at high risk of SA were significantly older, used excess alcohol, and were less able to perform activities of daily living, although their mean National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale scores were significantly lower than those with low risk for SA. None of the stroke survivors had ever been screened for SA. One out of every 2 stroke survivors attending a neurology clinic in Ghana is at high risk for undiagnosed SA. Greater regional awareness about SA presence and outcomes among patients and providers is warranted.

Diagnosing obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) is clinically relevant because untreated OSA has been associated with increased morbidity and mortality. The STOP-Bang questionnaire is a validated screening tool for OSA. We conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis to determine the effectiveness of STOP-Bang for screening patients suspected of having OSA and to predict its accuracy in determining the severity of OSA in the different populations. A search of the literature databases was performed. Inclusion criteria were: 1) Studies that used STOP-Bang questionnaire as a screening tool for OSA in adult subjects (>18 years); 2) The accuracy of the STOP-Bang questionnaire was validated by polysomnography--the gold standard for diagnosing OSA; 3) OSA was clearly defined as apnea/hypopnea index (AHI) or respiratory disturbance index (RDI) ≥ 5; 4) Publications in the English language. The quality of the studies were explicitly described and coded according to the Cochrane Methods group on the screening and diagnostic tests. Seventeen studies including 9,206 patients met criteria for the systematic review. In the sleep clinic population, the sensitivity was 90%, 94% and 96% to detect any OSA (AHI ≥ 5), moderate-to-severe OSA (AHI ≥15), and severe OSA (AHI ≥30) respectively. The corresponding NPV was 46%, 75% and 90%. A similar trend was found in the surgical population. In the sleep clinic population, the probability of severe OSA with a STOP-Bang score of 3 was 25%. With a stepwise increase of the STOP-Bang score to 4, 5, 6 and 7/8, the probability rose proportionally to 35%, 45%, 55% and 75%, respectively. In the surgical population, the probability of severe OSA with a STOP-Bang score of 3 was 15%. With a stepwise increase of the STOP-Bang score to 4, 5, 6 and 7/8, the probability increased to 25%, 35%, 45% and 65%, respectively. This meta-analysis confirms the high performance of the STOP-Bang questionnaire in the sleep clinic and surgical population for screening of OSA. The higher the STOP-Bang score, the greater is the probability of moderate-to-severe OSA.

This study aims: (1) to identify patients with multiple sclerosis (MS) who are at high risk for obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) by utilizing the STOP-BANG questionnaire and (2) to evaluate the relationship between OSA risk as determined by the STOP-BANG questionnaire and self-reported sleepiness and fatigue using the Epworth Sleepiness Scale (ESS) and the Fatigue Severity Scale (FSS), respectively. A total of 120 consecutive patients presenting to the UC Davis Neurology MS Clinic were invited to participate in an anonymous survey. The exclusion criteria were: age <18 years, indefinite MS diagnosis, or incomplete survey. There were 103 subjects included in our study: 42% of subjects (n = 43) met the criteria for high-risk OSA, 69% of subjects (n = 71) screened high for fatigue (FSS ≥ 4), but only 24 subjects (23%) screened high for excessive daytime sleepiness (ESS > 10). In males, 44% of the variation in ESS scores and 63% in FSS scores were explained by the STOP-BANG components. However, only 17% of the variation in ESS scores and 15% of the variation in FSS scores was explained by the STOP-BANG components in females. Over 40% of MS patients were identified as high risk for OSA based on the STOP-BANG questionnaire. The STOP-BANG questionnaire offers clinicians an efficient and objective tool for improving detection of OSA risk in MS patients.

Obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) is a highly prevalent sleep disorder; however, it remains underdiagnosed and undertreated. Although screening tools such as the Berlin questionnaire (BQ), STOP-BANG questionnaire (SBQ), STOP questionnaire (STOP), and Epworth sleepiness scale (ESS) are widely used for OSA, the findings regarding their diagnostic accuracy are controversial. Therefore, this meta-analysis investigated and compared the summary sensitivity, specificity, and diagnostic odds ratio (DOR) among the BQ, SBQ, STOP, and ESS according to the severity of OSA. Electronic databases, namely the Embase, PubMed, PsycINFO, ProQuest dissertations and theses A&I databases, and China knowledge resource integrated database, were searched from their inception to July 15, 2016. We included studies examining the sensitivity and specificity of the BQ, SBQ, STOP, and ESS against the apnea-hypopnea index (AHI) or respiratory disturbance index (RDI). The revised quality assessment of diagnostic accuracy studies was used to evaluate the methodological quality of studies. A random-effects bivariate model was used to estimate the summary sensitivity, specificity, and DOR of the tools. We identified 108 studies including a total of 47 989 participants. The summary estimates were calculated for the BQ, SBQ, STOP, and ESS in detecting mild (AHI/RDI ≥ 5 events/h), moderate (AHI/RDI ≥ 15 events/h), and severe OSA (AHI/RDI ≥ 30 events/h). The performance levels of the BQ, SBQ, STOP, and ESS in detecting OSA of various severity levels are outlined as follows: for mild OSA, the pooled sensitivity levels were 76%, 88%, 87%, and 54%; pooled specificity levels were 59%, 42%, 42%, and 65%; and pooled DORs were 4.30, 5.13, 4.85, and 2.18, respectively. For moderate OSA, the pooled sensitivity levels were 77%, 90%, 89%, and 47%; pooled specificity levels were 44%, 36%, 32%, and 621%; and pooled DORs were 2.68, 5.05, 3.71, and 1.45, respectively. For severe OSA, the pooled sensitivity levels were 84%, 93%, 90%, and 58%; pooled specificity levels were 38%, 35%, 28%, and 60%; and pooled DORs were 3.10, 6.51, 3.37, and 2.10, respectively. Therefore, for mild, moderate, and severe OSA, the pooled sensitivity and DOR of the SBQ were significantly higher than those of other screening tools (P < .05); however, the specificity of the SBQ was lower than that of the ESS (P < .05). Moreover, age, sex, body mass index, study sample size, study populations, presence of comorbidities, PSG or portable monitoring performance, and risk of bias in the domains of the index test and reference standard were significant moderators of sensitivity and specificity (P < .05). Compared with the BQ, STOP, and ESS, the SBQ is a more accurate tool for detecting mild, moderate, and severe OSA. Sleep specialists should use the SBQ to conduct patient interviews for the early diagnosis of OSA in clinical settings, particularly in resource-poor countries and sleep clinics where PSG is unavailable.

The aim of this study is to evaluate whether adding the item of "apple body type" to the STOP-BANG questionnaire enhances diagnostic performance of the questionnaire for detecting obstructive sleep apnea (OSA). Cross-sectional study. Sleep center setting. Two hundred and eight subjects who were referred for an evaluation of possible OSA at Tulane Comprehensive Sleep Center. The exclusion criteria were age<18years old, incomplete or absent questionnaire, incomplete body type identification, polysomnography (PSG) refusal, and pregnant women. STOP-BANG items and body type data were collected on the initial clinic visit. An overnight PSG was performed on every participant. Descriptive analyses of the demographic data and PSG variables were performed. The predictive parameters of STOP and STOP-BANG without and with body type score (STOP-Apple and STOPBANG-Apple) were compared. The STOP questionnaire's sensitivity/specificity/positive likelihood ratio (+LR) (cut-off=2) was 96%/11%/1.1, respectively whereas the STOP-Apple questionnaire (cut-off=3) was 88%/39%/1.5. The STOP-BANG's sensitivity/specificity/+LR (cut-off=3) was 96%/19%/1.2, respectively whereas the STOP-BANG-Apple questionnaire (cut-off=4) was 90%/39%/1.5. The area under the Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) curve of STOP-Apple was comparable to the STOP-BANG (P=0.25). The addition of the apple body type item to the STOP-BANG questionnaire in participants with a score≥3 led to increased specificity (67.4%), increased the odds ratio of having OSA of 2.5 (95% CI, 1.2-5.3) and odds ratio of having moderate-severe OSA of 4.7 (95% CI, 2.5-8.7). In the sleep center setting, adding the body type item to the STOP-BANG questionnaire improves not only clinical prediction for PSG confirmed OSA but also predicts moderate to severe of OSA.

The present review aims to provide an update on the various practical applications of the STOP-Bang questionnaire in anesthesia, surgery, and perioperative medicine. The STOP-Bang questionnaire was originally validated as a screening tool to identify surgical patients who are at high-risk of obstructive sleep apnea (OSA). A recent meta-analysis confirmed that STOP-Bang is validated for use in the sleep clinic, surgical, and general population. Patients with a STOP-Bang score of 0--2 can be classified as low-risk for moderate-to-severe OSA. Those with a score of 5--8 can be classified as high-risk for moderate-to-severe OSA. In patients with a score of 3 or 4, a specific combination of a STOP score at least 2 + BMI more than 35 kg/m or STOP score at least 2 + male or STOP score at least 2 + neck circumference more than 40 cm indicates higher risk for moderate-to-severe OSA. Further, patients with a STOP-Bang score at least 3 can be classified as high risk for moderate-to-severe OSA if the serum HCO3 at least 28 mmol/l. STOP-Bang can be used as a novel tool for perioperative risk stratification because it easily identifies patients who are at increased risk of perioperative complications. STOP-Bang at least 3 was recommended previously to identify the suspected or undiagnosed OSA. To reduce the false positive cases and to improve its specificity, a stepwise stratification is recommended to identify the patients at high risk of moderate-to-severe OSA. Because of its practical application, STOP-Bang is a useful screening tool for patients with suspected or undiagnosed OSA.

Obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) is common among surgical patients. The STOP-Bang questionnaire is a validated screening tool with a high sensitivity. However, its moderate specificity may yield fairly high false positive rate. We hypothesized that the specific combinations of predicting factors in the STOP-Bang questionnaire would improve its specificity. After research ethics approval, consented patients were asked to complete the STOP-Bang questionnaire and then underwent sleep studies. The predictive performance of the STOP-Bang alternative scoring models was evaluated. Five hundred sixteen patients with complete data on the STOP-Bang questionnaire and polysomnography were reported. When the STOP-Bang score was ≥ 3 (any 3 positive items), the sensitivity and specificity for identifying moderate-severe OSA was 87% and 31%, respectively. The specificity for any 2 positive items from the 4 STOP questions plus BMI > 35 kg/m(2), male gender, or neck circumference > 40 cm for identifying moderate-severe OSA was 85%, 77%, and 79%, respectively. Compared with STOP-Bang score ≥ 3, the predicted probability for severe OSA of the specific combinations of STOP score ≥ 2 + male and STOP score ≥ 2 + BMI increased by 36% and 42%, respectively. For severe OSA, the specific combination of STOP score ≥ 2 + BMI + male demonstrated a specificity of 97% and 86% increase in predicted probability versus any 4 positive items of STOP-Bang questionnaire. The specific constellations of predictive factors improved the specificity of STOP-Bang questionnaire. For patients with STOP score ≥ 2, male gender, and BMI > 35 kg/m(2) were more predictive than age ≥ 50 and neck circumference > 40 cm.

Several questionnaires are available for the screening of obstructive sleep apnea (OSA). Herein, we compare the performance characteristics of nine available questionnaires for assessing the likelihood of OSA. Consecutive subjects who underwent polysomnography at the sleep laboratory of the unit were included. Subjects with obstructive events and apnea hypopnea index (AHI) ≥5 were considered to have OSA. The likelihood ratios (LRs) and other performance characteristics were calculated for the following nine questionnaires: Berlin, modified Berlin, STOP, STOP-Bang and OSA50 questionnaires, sleep apnea clinical score (SACS), Epworth sleepiness scale (ESS), American Society of Anesthesiologists (ASA) checklist, and the elbow sign questionnaire. Two-hundred and ten subjects (mean age, 46.5 years; mean body mass index [BMI], 31.9 kg/m<sup>2</sup>; 27.1% women) were included. OSA was diagnosed in 78.1% of patients; 49.5% had severe OSA (AHI ≥30). The SACS questionnaire had the highest positive LR (LR+, 5.6) and positive predictive value (95.2%). The modified Berlin questionnaire had the best negative LR (LR-, 0.2) and the highest negative predictive value (57.1%). The STOP-Bang questionnaire also had an LR- of 0.2 if BMI threshold of 25 kg/m<sup>2</sup> (like that in the modified Berlin questionnaire) was used. Among individual items of various sleep questionnaires, the highest LR+ was obtained for neck circumference >43 cm (LR+, 4.9), while the best LR- was obtained for snoring and BMI >25 kg/m<sup>2</sup> (LR-, 0.2). The SACS and the STOP-Bang questionnaires (BMI threshold of 25 kg/m<sup>2</sup>) were found to provide the best positive and negative LRs, respectively, for the prediction of OSA. We believe that information from these questionnaires may help in prioritizing patients for sleep studies in high-volume centers.

The STOP-Bang questionnaire was developed as a quick and simple screening tool for obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) in preoperative clinics. We aimed to evaluate the validity of the STOP-Bang questionnaire to predict moderate-to-severe and severe OSA in the general population. A sample of 242 subjects selected from a population-based cohort in Singapore completed home-based sleep testing with a type 3 monitor. Subjects were asked to complete the STOP questionnaire while body mass index (BMI), age, neck circumference, and sex were recorded. A score of ≥3 on the questionnaire indicated high risk of OSA. A total of 68 subjects (28.1%) and 26 subjects (10.7%) had an apnea-hypopnea index (AHI) of ≥15 and ≥30 events per hour, respectively. Of the subjects, 89 (36.8%) were classified as high risk based on the questionnaire. The sensitivity of a STOP-Bang score of ≥3 was 66.2% to detect AHI ≥15 and 69.2% to detect AHI ≥30. The specificities were 74.7% and 67.1%, respectively. The negative predictive values were 85% for moderate-to-severe OSA and 94.8% for severe OSA. The corresponding positive predictive values were 50.6% and 20.2%, respectively. Using BMI cutoffs of 30 and 27.5 for Asians compared to the original cutoff of 35 did not improve the questionnaire performance significantly. The STOP-Bang questionnaire can be used as a screening tool in the general population in view of its moderate sensitivity and high negative predictive value for subjects with moderate-to-severe and severe OSA. The cutoff of BMI >35 can be used in Asians, as lower BMI cutoffs did not improve questionnaire performance.

To evaluate the impact of obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) on neurocognitive function and brain morphology in older adults with depression and cognitive impairment. We prospectively screened OSA with the STOP-Bang questionnaire in the last 25 patients enrolled into the Donepezil Treatment of Cognitive Impairment and Depression (DOTCODE) trial. High and low probability of OSA were defined as a STOP-Bang score of ≥5 (h-OSA) and of <5 (l-OSA), respectively. Baseline magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) was used to evaluate brain morphology. The initial 16 weeks of antidepressant treatment were part of the DOTCODE trial. After 16 weeks of antidepressant treatment, the h-OSA group performed significantly worse on the Selective Reminding Test delayed recall task than the l-OSA group, controlling for baseline performance (F = 19.1, df = 1,22, p < 0.001). In 19 of 25 participants who underwent brain MRI, the h-OSA group had significantly greater volumes of MRI hyperintensities in deep white matter, periventricular white matter, and subcortical gray matter compared with the l-OSA group. There was no significant association between OSA and hippocampal or entorhinal cortex volumes in our sample, even after controlling for intracranial volume. OSA is associated with impaired verbal episodic memory and microvascular damage in older adults with depression and cognitive impairment. One possibility is that by contributing to cerebral microvascular damage, OSA may exacerbate progressive memory decline.
