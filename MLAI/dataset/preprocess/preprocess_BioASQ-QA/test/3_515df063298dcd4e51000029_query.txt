What is the indication for prophylactic use of antibiotics in COPD?

[PMID: 20477251]
Exacerbations of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) are an important cause of morbidity and healthcare expenditure. In hospitalized patients, antibiotics decrease treatment failure and reduce mortality. There is also evidence for the effectiveness of antibiotics in treating COPD exacerbations in the community, but this is most convincing in patients with severe airflow obstruction and there is uncertainty regarding the value of antibiotics in patients with mild airflow obstruction. Treatment with antibiotics is usually recommended for patients who have an increase in sputum volume, sputum purulence and breathlessness, but the most important determinant of bacterial infection appears to be purulence. There is some evidence to suggest that the decision to use antibiotics can be guided by the use of procalcitonin, although this needs to be confirmed in further studies. Newer broad-spectrum antibiotics may be more effective than older antibiotics but, because of concerns regarding antibiotic resistance, it may be appropriate to reserve them for patients at highest risk of treatment failure. A number of studies suggest that antibiotic courses of 5 days in duration may be as effective as those for 7 days or more in patients with mild-to-moderate exacerbations of COPD. Guidelines do not recommend the use of prophylactic antibiotics in COPD but there is preliminary evidence to suggest that they may reduce the number of exacerbations. Until the full results of these studies are published, it will not be clear if they should be used.

Limiting antibiotic use is one of the most important measures to prevent and control emergence of antibiotic resistance. Therefore, antibiotics should usually only be prescribed for infection. Yet recent well-designed studies have demonstrated that prophylactic antibiotic use is of significant benefit to patients prone to developing infections. Study patients suffered from recurrent urinary tract infections, COPD or were mechanically ventilated in intensive care units. In the first 2 populations, use of antibiotics was associated with an increase in carriage of antibiotic-resistant bacteria, but in intensive care patients the opposite was documented. These studies demonstrate that antibiotics do more than cause resistance. The pros and cons of prophylactic antibiotic use must therefore be carefully considered.

Despite the advances in therapy, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) requires frequent hospital admissions due to acute exacerbations. We carried out a prospective randomized study of two groups of patients with COPD, one (n = 54) treated with azithromycin (500 mg/day) for three days every 21 days during the winter months, and a control group (n = 40) without treatment. A statistically significant reduction in the number of acute infectious episodes (187) and hospital admissions (22) was observed in the treated group versus the control group (249 and 45, respectively). A short prophylactic treatment course with azithromycin is a good alternative in the management of patients with severe, advanced COPD, and could lead to an improvement in social and healthcare costs
