In which way does DNA hydroxymethylation affect patients with Systemic Lupus Erythematosus?

[PMID: 26984631]
One of the major disappointments in autoimmunity has been the relative lack of informative data when genomewide associations (GWAS) have been applied to patients with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE). Indeed, there is increasing evidence that SLE is characterized by widespread epigenetic changes. 5-Hydroxymethylcytosine (5-hmC) is a newly discovered modified form of cytosine suspected to be an important epigenetic modification in embryonic development, cell differentiation and cancer. DNA methylation dynamics have already been implicated in the pathogenesis of SLE, while little is known about hydroxymethylation in this process. Here, we show an increased 5-hmC level in genomic DNA in CD4(+) T cells of patients with SLE compared with healthy controls, accompanied by the up-regulated expression of the Ten-eleven translocation TET2 and TET3, which can enzymatically convert 5-methylcytosine (5-mC) to 5-hmC. Moreover, we present the differential patterns of DNA hydroxymethylation in genome-wide promoter regions in SLE CD4(+) T cells compared with healthy controls. We identified 2748 genes with increased 5-hmC levels in promoter regions in SLE CD4(+) T cells, which were enriched in critical pathways, including neurotrophin signaling, WNT signaling, MAPK signaling, calcium signaling and the mTOR signaling pathway. Through a combined analysis of differential DNA hydroxymethylation profile and gene expression profile in SLE CD4(+) T cells, we found 131 genes with the increased 5-hmC in promoter regions and up-regulated expression in SLE CD4(+) T cells compared with healthy controls, including selected immune-related genes, i.e. SOCS1, NR2F6 and IL15RA, which were also confirmed by ChIP-qPCR. Furthermore, we demonstrate that CTCF, as a transcription factor, can mediate DNA hydroxymethylation and contribute to overexpression of SOCS1 in CD4(+) T cells through binding to the promoter region of SOCS1. Taken together, our study reveals a critical differential 5-hmC in the genome-wide promoter regions of SLE CD4(+) T cells and provides a novel mechanism that suggests that DNA hydroxymethylation contributes to the aberrant regulation of genes transcription in the pathogenesis of SLE.

Epigenetic events have been linked with disease expression in individuals genetically predisposed to the development of systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), a severe systemic autoimmune/inflammatory disease. Altered DNA methylation and hydroxymethylation as well as histone modifications mediate changes in chromatin accessibility and gene expression in immune cells from SLE patients. Defective epigenetic control contributes to uncontrolled expression of inflammatory mediators, including cytokines and co-receptors, resulting in systemic inflammation and tissue damage. While the pathophysiological involvement of epigenetic changes in SLE has been accepted for some time, we only recently started to investigate and understand molecular events contributing to epigenetic dysregulation. Here, epigenetic alterations will be discussed with a focus on underling molecular events that may be target of preventative measures or future treatment strategies.

DNA hypomethylation plays an important role in the pathogenesis of systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE). Here we investigated whether 3-hydroxy butyrate dehydrogenase 2 (BDH2), a modulator of intracellular iron homeostasis, was involved in regulating DNA hypomethylation and hyper-hydroxymethylation in lupus CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells. Our results showed that BDH2 expression was decreased, intracellular iron was increased, global DNA hydroxymethylation level was elevated, while methylation level was reduced in lupus CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells compared with healthy controls. The decreased BDH2 contributed to DNA hyper-hydroxymethylation and hypomethylation via increasing intracellular iron in CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells, which led to overexpression of immune related genes. Moreover, we showed that BDH2 was the target gene of miR-21. miR-21 promoted DNA demethylation in CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells through inhibiting BDH2 expression. Our data demonstrated that the dysregulation of iron homeostasis in CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells induced by BDH2 deficiency contributes to DNA demethylation and self-reactive T cells in SLE.

Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) is a prototypical autoimmune disease characterized by production of autoantibodies against a series of nuclear antigens. Although the exact cause of SLE is still unknown, the influence of environment, which is largely reflected by the epigenetic mechanisms, with DNA methylation changes in particular, are generally considered as key players in the pathogenesis of SLE. As an important post-translational modification, DNA methylation mainly suppresses the expression of relevant genes. Accumulating evidence has indicated that abnormal DNA hypomethylation in T cells is an important epigenetic hallmark in SLE. Apart from those classic methylation-sensitive autoimmunity-related genes in lupus, such as CD11a (ITGAL), Perforin (PRF1), CD70 (TNFSF7), CD40 ligand (TNFSF5) and PP2Acα, the genome-wide methylation pattern has also been explored recently, providing us a more and more full-scale picture of the abnormal status of DNA methylation in SLE. On the other hand, certain miRNAs, RFX1, defective ERK pathway signaling, Gadd45α and DNA hydroxymethylation have been proposed as potential mechanisms leading to DNA hypomethylation in lupus. In this review, we summarize current understanding of T cell DNA methylation changes and the consequently altered gene expressions in lupus, and how they contribute to the development of SLE. Possible mechanisms underlying these aberrancies are also discussed based on the reported literature and our own findings.

Systemic lupus erythematosus is a severe autoimmune/inflammatory condition of unknown pathophysiology. Though genetic predisposition is essential for disease expression, risk alleles in single genes are usually insufficient to confer disease. Epigenetic dysregulation has been suggested as the missing link between genetic risk and the development of clinically evident disease. Over the past decade, epigenetic events moved into the focus of research targeting the molecular pathophysiology of SLE. Epigenetic alteration can be the net result of preceding infections, medication, diet, and/or other environmental influences. While altered DNA methylation and histone modifications had already been established as pathomechanisms, DNA hydroxymethylation was more recently identified as an activating epigenetic mark. Defective epigenetic control contributes to uncontrolled cytokine and co-receptor expression, resulting in immune activation and tissue damage in SLE. Epigenetic alterations promise potential as disease biomarkers and/or future therapeutic targets in SLE and other autoimmune/inflammatory conditions.
