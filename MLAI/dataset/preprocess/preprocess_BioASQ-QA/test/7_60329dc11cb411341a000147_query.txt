Biofilm formation is one of the important features of <i>Staphylococcus epidermidis</i>, particularly in nosocomial infections. We aimed to investigate the biofilm production by phenotypic methods and the presence of <i>ica</i> genes in <i>S epidermidis</i>. A total of 41 <i>S epidermidis</i> isolates were recovered from different clinical specimens. Biofilm formation was evaluated by microtiter plate, tube method and Congo red agar method. The presence of <i>icaA</i> and <i>icaD</i> genes was investigated by PCR. Validity of methods (sensitivity and specificity), and metrics for test performance (positive/negative predictive value, and positive/negative likelihood ratio) were determined. By both microtiter plate and tube method, 53.6% of <i>S epidermidis</i> isolates were able to produce biofilm, whilst only 24.4% of isolates provided a biofilm phenotype on Congo red agar plates. <i>icaA</i> and <i>icaD</i> genes were found in 100% and 95.1% of isolates, respectively. Biofilm phenotypes accounted for 4.8% by microtiter plate assay, despite the absence of the <i>ica</i> gene. Congo red agar and PCR exhibited a lower sensitivity (18% and 45.5%, respectively) for identifying the biofilm phenotype in comparison to microtiter plate. The microtiter plate method remains generally a better tool to screen biofilm production in <i>S epidermidis</i>. In addition, the ability of <i>S epidermidis</i> to form biofilm is not always dependent on the presence of <i>ica</i> genes, highlighting the importance of <i>ica</i>-independent mechanisms of biofilm formation. The use of reliable methods to specifically detect biofilms can be helpful to treat the patients affected by such problematic bacteria.

Recently, it has been shown that S. epidermidis includes the ica operon responsible for slime production. In the operon, coexpression of icaA and icaD genes is required for full slime synthesis. In this study, the presence of icaA and icaD genes was searched for in a collection of 100 Staphylococcus epidermidis strains from catheter-associated infections by an original PCR method. Another 51 strains of S. epidermidis isolated from the skin or mucosa of healthy volunteers (26 of which derived from the hospital staff) were also investigated. Slime-forming ability was phenotypically tested on Congo red agar plates. Sixty-one percent of the strains isolated from catheters were icaA- icaD-positive and produced slime. The results indicate that detection of ica genes by a PCR method is a useful tool for prompt identification of S. epidermidis slime-forming strains isolated from catheter-related infections. Also, three saprophytic strains from the hospital staff were positive for slime synthesis and presence of ica genes, suggesting a potential diffusion of slime-forming strains in hospital personnel.

Bacterial contamination of platelet concentrates (PCs) poses the greatest infectious risk in modern transfusion medicine despite the implementation of measures such as improved skin disinfection and first aliquot diversion. The majority of PC contaminants are commensal skin flora introduced by venipuncture at the time of blood collection. The predominant organisms are Gram-positive coagulase-negative staphylococci such as Staphylococcus capitis. This bacterium has been implicated in numerous instances of infection and sepsis, likely for its ability to form surface-associated communities of micro-organisms encased in extracellular materials, known as biofilms. In the present study, five strains of S. capitis isolated from contaminated PCs were assessed for their ability to produce extracellular polysaccharide (slime), a canonical indicator of biofilm-formation ability, on Congo red agar plates. Biofilm formation was evaluated in both glucose-enriched trypticase soy broth (TSBg) and in PCs by using a crystal violet staining assay. The chemical nature of the biofilms was evaluated by disruption assays using sodium metaperiodate and proteinase K. In addition, biofilm architecture was observed by scanning electron microscopy. The presence of the biofilm-associated icaR and icaADBC genes was also examined by PCR. While only two out of the five S. capitis strains formed biofilms in TSBg, all strains formed biofilms in PCs. The ability of strains to produce extracellular polysaccharide and their possession of wild-type ica genes were not exclusive predictors of biofilm formation in TSBg or PCs; different profiles of biofilm markers were observed among isolates. This is likely due to the proteinaceous composition of the S. capitis biofilm matrix. Interestingly, an ica-negative, non-slime-producing isolate was capable of biofilm formation in PCs. Together, these data indicate that the platelet storage environment stimulates biofilm formation in S. capitis in the absence of extracellular polysaccharide production and that multiple bacterial factors and regulatory elements are likely involved in biofilm formation in this milieu.

This study aimed to screen for and characterise methicillin-susceptible Staphylococcus aureus (MSSA) and methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA) in nasal swabs and milk from healthy cows from different regions in Tunisia. A total of 141 Staphylococcus spp. isolates were recovered from milk and nasal samples of cows. S. aureus isolates were further characterised by determining their antimicrobial susceptibilities, genes encoding antimicrobial resistance and virulence factors, biofilm production, agr type and PFGE. spa and SCCmec typing and MLST were also performed for the MRSA isolate. Twenty-seven isolates (19.1%) were identified as S. aureus, of which 26 were MSSA and 1 was MRSA. The MSSA isolates were resistant to penicillin (73.1%), fusidic acid (61.5%), clindamycin (34.6%) and erythromycin (34.6%). The MRSA isolate, from a milk sample, was resistant to cefoxitin, penicillin, fusidic acid, amikacin and clindamycin. Twenty-five isolates (92.6%) had at least one enterotoxin gene. Only four isolates (14.8%) were positive for the tsst-1 gene. Genes encoding the exfoliative toxins D and A were detected in 9 (33.3%) and 6 (22.2%) isolates, respectively. The single MRSA isolate and 22 MSSA isolates were biofilm-producers on Congo red agar plates. Twelve pulsotypes were identified amongst 25 MSSA isolates revealing the clonal diversity of these isolates; however, one MSSA isolate was identified as CC398. The MRSA isolate was PVL-negative and was typed as ST97-t267-agrI-SCCmecV. Contamination of milk with S. aureus, especially enterotoxin- and TSST-1-positive strains, poses a potential public-health threat. This is the first report of MRSA of bovine origin in Tunisia.

Salmonella enterica is one of the pathogens that is frequently identified as the cause of fresh produce-related outbreaks. Biofilm formation is a factor that can contribute to pathogen survival on produce surface. The goal of our current research was to investigate the survival of five S. enterica strains representing different serotypes (i.e., Typhimurium, Enteritidis, Daytona, Poona, and Newport) on whole mini cucumbers stored at refrigeration (4°C) and room temperature (22°C). We also determined the strains survival on glass slides and in phosphate-buffered saline at 4 and 22°C, as well as the ability to form biofilms on a solid-liquid interphase. A rapid decrease in cell density (>4-log reduction over 8 days) of all five tested strains was observed on glass slides, while a slower die-off (<1-log reduction in 8 days) was observed in PBS. No significant difference in the die-off rate was observed among the five strains at 4 or 22°C. The die-off rate on the surface of mini cucumbers at 4°C was significantly slower ( P < 0.02) for Salmonella Enteritidis LMFS-S-JF-005 compared with the remaining four strains. At 22°C, Salmonella Poona S306 was able to grow by more than 1.5 log units on whole mini cucumbers over a period of 8 days, while the cell density of the other four strains remained at the same level compared with day 0. At this temperature, Salmonella Poona S306 was also able to form significantly stronger biofilms on a solid-liquid interphase ( P < 0.01) and was the only strain that presented a red, dry, and rough morphotype on Congo red agar plates, indicating the formation of both curli fimbriae and cellulose. These results revealed that the fate of Salmonella on mini cucumbers is strain specific, which highlighted the need for tailored mitigation strategies, such as the effective control of temperature and moisture for limiting the survival or growth of high-risk Salmonella strains between harvest and consumption of fresh produce.

Febrile neutropenia (FN) is the evolution of fever in a patient with neutropenia over 38.0°C. Neutropenia is diagnosed when absolute neutrophil count (ANC) <1500 cells/µL. FN represents a common complication of cancer treatment. Hence, it is featured to be a major cause of morbidity and mortality in cancer patients. <i>Staphylococcus aureus</i> is one of the most important microorganisms isolated from the blood of febrile neutropenic patients. Infections caused by <i>S. aureus</i> range from mild to life-threatening diseases. Biofilm production by <i>S. aureus</i> is one of the most significant virulence factors of the bacterium as it prevents the penetration of antibiotics. Recently, it has been shown that <i>S. aureus</i> carries the <i>ica</i> operon responsible for biofilm production. The aim of the work is to determine a genotypic characterization that includes not only the detection of <i>icaA</i> and <i>icaD</i> genes in <i>S. aureus</i> but also the determination of their relation to clinical and microbiological features. Empiric antibacterial treatment was recommended for cancer patients receiving chemotherapy. The relation between the presence of <i>icaA</i> and <i>icaD</i> and biofilm production was determined in a collection of 66 <i>S. aureus</i> samples from febrile neutropenic patients. Biofilm-forming ability was tested on Congo Red agar plates. Also, the effect of the most sensitive antibiotics on the bacterial cells was determined by an electron microscope. Of the bacterial samples, 48 were biofilm-productive and 18 were non-biofilm productive. For the biofilm productive bacteria, 37.5% were positive for <i>icaA</i>, 22.9% were positive for <i>icaD</i> and 10.4% were positive for both. Linezolid was the most effective antibiotic and it is highly recommended for the treatment of febrile neutropenia caused by biofilm-productive <i>S. aureus</i>. Severe changes were found on the bacterial cell after being treated with Linezolid. The <i>icaA</i> and <i>icaD</i> genes were present in only 50% of biofilm-productive bacteria. The <i>ica</i> operon is present in only 50% of biofilm-productive <i>S. aureus</i> and Linezolid is the best antibiotic against these bacteria.

Staphylococcus epidermidis is a frequent pathogen in infections associated with orthopedic implants. We studied 123 S. epidermidis strains from infections related to orthopedic implants, as regards their ability to express a factor of virulence, namely the slime, an extracellular polysaccharide, which mediates adherence to implants and bacterial colonization. The slime-producing ability was determined by PCR detection of icaA and icaD genes responsible for slime synthesis, and by culture on Congo red agar plates in which slime-producing strains form black colonies, while nonslime-forming ones develop red colonies. 56% of the S. epidermidis isolates were icaA- icaD-positive and grew to become black colonies. In the evaluation of the distribution of slime-forming strains in different sites and types of implants, we found a slight, but not statistically significant, increase in slime-forming strains in total joint prostheses, where tissue compression near the articular faces can form niches in which bacteria crowd, sheltered by the slime. Our findings confirm the role of ica genes as a virulence marker in the pathogenesis of implant-associated orthopedic infections. However, they do not show the existence of a higher frequency of slime-positive strains in a specific type of implant.
