What is a SERM?

[PMID: 26704594]
A series of triphenylethylene bisphenol analogues of the selective estrogen receptor modulator (SERM) tamoxifen were synthesized and evaluated for their abilities to inhibit aromatase, bind to estrogen receptor α (ER-α) and estrogen receptor β (ER-β), and antagonize the activity of β-estradiol in MCF-7 human breast cancer cells. The long-range goal has been to create dual aromatase inhibitor (AI)/selective estrogen receptor modulators (SERMs). The hypothesis is that in normal tissue the estrogenic SERM activity of a dual AI/SERM could attenuate the undesired effects stemming from global estrogen depletion caused by the AI activity of a dual AI/SERM, while in breast cancer tissue the antiestrogenic SERM activity of a dual AI/SERM could act synergistically with AI activity to enhance the antiproliferative effect. The potent aromatase inhibitory activities and high ER-α and ER-β binding affinities of several of the resulting analogues, together with the facts that they antagonize β-estradiol in a functional assay in MCF-7 human breast cancer cells and they have no E/Z isomers, support their further development in order to obtain dual AI/SERM agents for breast cancer treatment.

Selective estrogen receptor modulators (SERMs) have been used off-label in men for more than 50 years. SERMs exert their action on the estrogen receptor agonistically or antagonistically. A fundamental knowledge of the complex molecular action and physiology of SERMs is important in understanding their use and future directions of study in men. To review the basic science and mechanism of the action of estrogens, the estrogen receptor, and SERMs, and the existing clinical publications on the use of SERMs in men for infertility and hypogonadism with their strengths and weaknesses and to identify the need for future studies. After a review of publications on the basic science of estrogen receptors, a chronologic review of published evidence-based studies on the use of SERMs in men for infertility and hypogonadism was undertaken. Clinical publications were assessed for type of study, inclusion criteria, outcome measurements, and results. Strengths and weaknesses of the publications were assessed and discussed. Few prospective rigorously controlled trials have been undertaken on the use of SERMs in men. Most existing trials are largely retrospective anecdotal studies with inconsistent inclusion and end-point measurements. The SERMs are complex and at times can produce paradoxical results. Their action likely depends on the genetics of the individual, his tissue-specific composition of estrogen receptors, the molecular structure and pharmacodynamics of the SERMs, and their metabolism. Rigorously controlled trials of the use of SERMs in men are needed to better identify their clinical benefit and long-term safety in infertile and hypogonadal men. Recent placebo-controlled pharmaceutical industry SERM trials have demonstrated short-term safety and efficacy in men with secondary hypogonadism and eventually might provide an alternative to exogenous testosterone replacement therapy in men with secondary hypogonadism.

Selective oestrogen receptor modulators (SERMs) are compounds with a mixed agonist/antagonist activity on oestrogen receptors. An ideal SERM is a compound with an oestrogen antagonist effect on the breast and uterus but oestrogen agonist effect on bone. Beside tamoxifen, a group of well-investigated SERMs is represented by raloxifene, LY-353381 (SERM3), EM-800 and CP-336156. On an empirical basis, tamoxifen has been used to pharmacologically treat desmoid tumours. Recently, raloxifene, a second-generation SERM, has been used in the treatment of familial adenomatous polyposis patients affected by desmoid tumour. The mechanisms through which these molecules affect desmoid tumour growth appear to be due, in part, to the fact that SERMs may act independently of oestrogen receptors. The knowledge of the molecular basis of SERM action will make the development of novel synthetic compounds with engineered tissue selectivity possible.

Antiresorptive agents for treating postmenopausal osteoporosis include selective estrogen receptor modulator (SERM), bisphosphonates and denoumab. Teriparatide is the only Food and Drug Administration-approved anabolic agent. Synergistic effects of combining teriparatide with an antiresorptive agent have been proposed and studied. This article reviews the trial designs and the outcomes of combination therapies. Results of the combination therapy for teriparatide and bisphosphonates were mixed; while small increases of bone density were observed in the combination therapy of teriparatide and estrogen/SERM and that of teriparatide and denosumab. Those clinical studies were limited by small sample sizes and lack of fracture outcomes.

Selective estrogen receptor modulator (SERM) is designated as synthetic ligands for estrogen receptors (ERs), exhibiting tissue-specific agonisitic/antagonisitic activities. Among SERM, raloxifen is a most clinically successful as an anti-oseteoporotic agent. Such tissue-specific actions of SERM are presumed to mediate through unusual structure alteration of liganded ERs coupled with co-regulator recruitments.

Tamoxifen was approved for breast cancer prevention in October 1998. Thus, for the first time, we as gynecologists are being asked to prescribe this drug to healthy women. In the past each one of us has cared for women with breast cancer who have been treated with tamoxifen by oncologists or breast surgeons for the malignancy. Effects of tamoxifen on the uterus resulting in carcinomas, hyperplasia, and polyps are well known. Furthermore, tamoxifen has estrogenic properties in the venous system, increasing the incidence of deep vein thrombosis and pulmonary emboli. A new SERM (selective estrogen receptor modulator), raloxifene, has been approved for prevention and treatment of osteoporosis in postmenopausal women. It does not have stimulatory effects on the endometrium; however, it is estrogenic in the venous system. Preclinical data, as well as the breast cancer incidence reported in studies of the skeleton, seem to indicate that its effects in the breast are similar to those of tamoxifen. This article reviews tamoxifen and the new SERM, raloxifene, in an attempt to help gynecologists better understand each compound and what data are currently known, what we hope to learn from future studies, and what currently makes sense for clinical practice.

Selective estrogen receptor modulators (SERMs) are synthetic non-steroidal agents which have varying estrogen agonist and antagonist activities in different tissues, most likely due to the receptor conformation changes associated with that SERM's binding and the subsequent effect on transcription. Clinical trials aim to differentiate amongst SERMs on selected target tissues for use in postmenopausal women including effects on breast, bone, cardiovascular venous thrombosis risk, endometrium, vagina, vasomotor symptoms, and brain. This paper describes differences in clinical effects on selected target tissues of SERMs that are approved, discontinued or in development. FDA approved SERMs include tamoxifen and toremifene used for prevention and treatment of breast cancer, raloxifene approved for prevention and treatment of osteoporosis and prevention of invasive breast cancer, and ospemifene approved for treatment of dyspareunia from menopausal vaginal atrophy. The FDA approved first tissue selective estrogen complex (TSEC) a pairing of conjugated equine estrogens with the SERM, bazedoxifene. This pairing reduces the risk of endometrial hyperplasia that can occur with the estrogenic component of the TSEC without the need for a progestogen in women with a uterus. It also allows for the estrogenic benefits on relief of hot flashes and prevention of bone loss without stimulating the breast or the endometrium. In clinical practice, the tissue-selective actions of SERMs, alone or paired with estrogens, allow for individualization in meeting the treatment needs of postmenopausal women by providing targeted tissue effects. This article is part of a Special Issue entitled 'Menopause'.

Tamoxifen, a pioneering selective estrogen receptor modulator (SERM), has long been a therapeutic choice for all stages of estrogen receptor (ER)-positive breast cancer. The clinical application of long-term adjuvant antihormone therapy for the breast cancer has significantly improved breast cancer survival. However, acquired resistance to SERM remains a significant challenge in breast cancer treatment. The evolution of acquired resistance to SERMs treatment was primarily discovered using MCF-7 tumors transplanted in athymic mice to mimic years of adjuvant treatment in patients. Acquired resistance to tamoxifen is unique because the growth of resistant tumors is dependent on SERMs. It appears that acquired resistance to SERM is initially able to utilize either E2 or a SERM as the growth stimulus in the SERM-resistant breast tumors. Mechanistic studies reveal that SERMs continuously suppress nuclear ER-target genes even during resistance, whereas they function as agonists to activate multiple membrane-associated molecules to promote cell growth. Laboratory observations in vivo further show that three phases of acquired SERM-resistance exists, depending on the length of SERMs exposure. Tumors with Phase I resistance are stimulated by both SERMs and estrogen. Tumors with Phase II resistance are stimulated by SERMs, but are inhibited by estrogen due to apoptosis. The laboratory models suggest a new treatment strategy, in which limited-duration, low-dose estrogen can be used to purge Phase II-resistant breast cancer cells. This discovery provides an invaluable insight into the evolution of drug resistance to SERMs, and this knowledge is now being used to justify clinical trials of estrogen therapy following long-term antihormone therapy. All of these results suggest that cell populations that have acquired resistance are in constant evolution depending upon selection pressure. The limited availability of growth stimuli in any new environment enhances population plasticity in the trial and error search for survival.

Selective estrogen receptor modulators (SERMs) have the potential to treat estrogen sensitive diseases such as uterine leiomyoma and endometriosis, which are prevalent in reproductive age women. However, SERMs also increase the risk of developing ovarian cysts in this population, a phenomenon that is not seen in postmenopausal women. It is believed that current SERMs partially block estradiol's ability to downregulate gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) secretion from the hypothalamus thereby interfering with estradiol's negative feedback, leading to increased ovarian stimulation by gonadotropins, and cyst formation. It has been postulated that a SERM with poor brain exposure would have less negative effect on the HPO axis, therefore reducing the risk of developing ovarian cysts. In order to test this hypothesis, we identified an early marker of SERM-dependent ovarian effects: upregulation of Cyp17a1 mRNA. SERMs known to cause ovarian cysts upregulate Cyp17a1 after only 4 days of dosing and suppression of the HPO axis prevented this regulation, indicating that ovarian expression of Cyp17a1 was secondary to SERM's effect on the brain. We then characterized three SERMs with similar binding affinity and antagonist effects on the uterus for their relative brain/plasma exposure and ovarian effects. We found that the degree of brain exposure correlated very well with Cyp17a1 expression.

A selective estrogen receptor modulator (SERM) for the potential treatment of hot flushes is described. (R)-(+)-7,9-difluoro-5-[4-(2-piperidin-1-ylethoxy)phenyl]-5H-6-oxachrysen-2-ol, LSN2120310, potently binds ERalpha and ERbeta and is an antagonist in MCF-7 breast adenocarcinoma and Ishikawa uterine cancer cell lines. The compound is a potent estrogen antagonist in the rat uterus. In ovariectomized rats, the compound lowers cholesterol, maintains bone mineral density, and is efficacious in a morphine dependent rat model of hot flush efficacy.

Most immune cells, including myeloid progenitors and terminally differentiated dendritic cells (DC), express estrogen receptors (ER) making these cells sensitive to estrogens. Our laboratory recently demonstrated that 17-beta-estradiol (E2) promotes the GM-CSF-mediated development of CD11c+ CD11b(int) DC from murine bone marrow precursors. We tested whether the therapeutic selective estrogen receptor modulators (SERM), raloxifene and tamoxifen, can perturb DC development and activation. SERM, used in treatment of breast cancer and osteoporosis, bind to ER and mediate tissue-specific agonistic or antagonistic effects. Raloxifene and tamoxifen inhibited the differentiation of estrogen-dependent DC from bone marrow precursors ex vivo in competition experiments with physiological levels of E2. DC differentiated in the presence of SERM were assessed for their capacity to internalize fluoresceinated Ags as well as respond to inflammatory stimuli by increasing surface expression of molecules important for APC function. Although SERM-exposed DC exhibited increased ability to internalize Ags, they were hyporesponsive to bacterial LPS: relative to control DC, they less efficiently up-regulated the expression of MHC class II, CD86, and to a lesser extent, CD80 and CD40. This phenotype indicates that these SERM act to maintain DC in an immature state by inhibiting DC responsiveness to inflammatory stimuli. Thus, raloxifene and tamoxifen impair E2-promoted DC differentiation and reduce the immunostimulatory capacity of DC. These observations suggest that SERM may depress immunity when given to healthy individuals for the prevention of osteoporosis and breast cancer and may interfere with immunotherapeutic strategies to improve antitumor immunity in breast cancer patients.

Selective estrogen receptor modulators (SERMs) reduce breast cancer risk. Adoption of SERMs as prevention medication remains low. This is the first study to quantify social, cultural, and psychologic factors driving decision making regarding SERM use in women counseled on breast cancer prevention options. A survey study was conducted with women counseled by a health care provider (HCP) about SERMs. A statistical comparison of responses was performed between those who decided to use and those who decided not to use SERMs. Independent factors associated with the decision were determined using logistic regression. Of 1,023 participants, 726 made a decision: 324 (44.6%) decided to take a SERM and 402 (55.4%) decided not to. The most important factor for deciding on SERM use was the HCP recommendation. Other characteristics associated with the decision included attitudes and perceptions regarding medication intake, breast cancer worry, trust in HCP, family members with blood clots, and others' experiences with SERMs. The odds of SERM intake when HCP recommended were higher for participants with a positive attitude toward taking medications than for those with a negative attitude (<i>P</i><sub>interaction</sub> = 0.01). This study highlights the importance of social and cultural aspects for SERM decision making, most importantly personal beliefs and experiences. HCPs' recommendations play a statistically significant role in decision making and are more likely to be followed if in line with patients' attitudes. Results indicate the need for developing interventions for HCPs that not only focus on the presentation of medical information but, equally as important, on addressing patients' beliefs and experiences. <i>Cancer Prev Res; 10(11); 625-34. ©2017 AACR</i><i>See related editorial by Crew, p. 609</i>.

Estrogen exposure is one of the strongest risk factors for breast cancer development. Chemoprevention with selective estrogen receptor modulators (SERM), such as tamoxifen and raloxifene, has been shown in randomized controlled trials to reduce breast cancer incidence by up to 50% among high-risk women. Despite the strength of this evidence, there is significant underutilization of chemoprevention. Given the relatively few modifiable breast cancer risk factors, SERM use provides an important strategy for the primary prevention of this disease. Understanding factors which influence chemoprevention decision-making will inform efforts to implement breast cancer risk assessment and increase chemoprevention uptake in clinical practice. <i>Cancer Prev Res; 10(11); 609-11. ©2017 AACR</i><i>See related article by Holmberg et al., p. 625</i>.

SERMs represent a diverse group of molecules with varying levels of estrogenic agonist and antagonist activity in target tissues. SERMs have a long regulatory approval history and have been studied for a variety of therapeutic indications. The clinical effects of SERMs have been evaluated in a large number of phase 3 clinical trials. Many of the available SERMs have proved to be effective as chemo-preventive agents and treatments for breast cancer and a number are useful for the prevention and treatment of osteoporosis. The endometrial effect of SERMs has been a key differentiator in clinical practice and a major hurdle for regulatory approval. The effect of SERMs in the vagina also represents a major distinction among different SERMs. This review summarized key clinical finding of SERMs in different target tissues.

We studied the beneficial effects of dietary consumption of n-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA) and two selective estrogen receptor modulator (SERM) derivatives (SERM-I and SERM-II) and their combined effect on serum lipids, skin dermis and adipose layers, bone marrow adipogenesis, and cytokine secretion in mice. Two different ovariectomized (OVX) models were studied: treatment began immediately post-OVX in one and 3 months post-OVX in the other. Our results showed that n-3 PUFA and both SERMs decreased triglyceride levels in the serum, and that SERMs also decreased serum cholesterol levels while n-3 PUFA had no similar effect. SERMs had no effect on IL-6, IL-1 beta, or IL-10 levels, but they decreased ex vivo tumor necrosis factor (TNF-alpha). N-3 PUFA decreased secretion of non-induced IL-6 and TNF-alpha from cultured BMC and IL-1 beta levels in vivo (i.e., in bone marrow plasma), but its main effect was a significant elevation in the secretion of IL-10, a known anti-inflammatory cytokine. OVX-induced B-lymphopoiesis was not affected by LY-139481 (SERM-I) while LY-353381 (SERM-II) exhibited an estrogen-antagonistic effect in sham and OVX mice and elevated the amount of B-cells in bone marrow. Fish oil consumption prevented the elevation in B-lymphopoiesis caused by OVX, but had no curative effect on established augmented B-lymphopoiesis. This activity could be mediated via the elevation of IL-10 which was shown to suppress B-lymphopoiesis. Both SERMs and n-3 PUFA inhibited the increase in adipose tissue thickness caused by OVX in mice. Our results showed that n-3 PUFA, could prevent some of the deleterious outcomes of estrogen deficiency that were not affected by SERMs. We observed no significant beneficial effects of the combined administration of SERM-I, SERM-II, and PUFA on the studied parameters.The exact mechanism by which polyunsaturated fatty acids exert their activities is still not clear, but peroxisome proliferator-activated receptors (PPARs) might be involved in processes which are modulated by n-3 PUFA.

The aim of this study was to identify the effect of selective estrogen receptor modulator (SERM) on non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) in Asian women. We retrospectively evaluated fatty liver development and/or serum alanine aminotransferase (ALT) elevation during SERM treatment in 1061 women who were diagnosed and treated with breast cancer in 2005 at Asan Medical Center. 45 of 618 SERM-treated patients with normal ALT at baseline experienced ALT elevation during SERM treatment. Among the 112 SERM-treated patients who underwent liver imaging test, fatty liver was observed in 47 and both fatty liver and ALT elevation developed in 16 of 102 SERM-treated patients with normal baseline ALT. The cumulative rates of ALT elevation (10.7 vs. 4.3%; P = 0.002), fatty liver (48.5 vs. 20.9%; P < 0.001), and both fatty liver and ALT elevation (17.7 vs. 7.1%; P = 0.02) at 60 months were significantly higher in the SERM group than non-SERM group. By multivariate analysis, SERM treatment increased the risk of ALT elevation (hazard ratio [HR], 2.20; P = 0.01), fatty liver development (HR, 3.59; P < 0.001), and both fatty liver and ALT elevation (HR, 4.98; P = 0.01). After discontinuation of SERM, elevated serum ALT normalized in 39 (92.9%) and there were no instances of liver-related death or progression to liver cirrhosis in patients who experienced fatty liver or ALT elevation. Although SERM treatment is significantly associated with NAFLD in Asian women, considering the tolerability and reversibility of NAFLD induced by SERM, it can be continued with liver function monitoring in relevant patients.

Selective estrogen receptor modulators (SERMs) bind to estrogen receptor (ER) and develop tissue-selective actions as estrogen agonists or antagonists. As such, SERMs have been developed to exert estrogen-like beneficial effects against some disorders including osteoporosis, while reducing estrogen-related risks, including breast cancer. Prevention of vertebral fractures by a SERM, raloxifene (RLX), in osteoporotic postmenopausal women has been well established. RLX does not increase or decrease cardiovascular events, overall mortality, cardiovascular mortality or the overall number of strokes, but there appears to be a small increase in stroke mortality. Both RLX and tamoxifen similarly reduce the risk of ER-positive invasive breast cancer. At the same time, RLX treatment is associated with 36% fewer uterine cancer incidence and 29% less thromboembolic events. Keeping these results in mind, it is our responsibility to critically evaluate and decide timing and length of treatment, as well as subjects with benefits or risks for the treatment of osteoporosis by SERMs.

SERM is the abbreviation of the selective estrogen receptor modulator which is the synthetic ligands of estrogen receptor (ER) acting estrogenically or anti-estrogenically among various tissues through modifying the ER function. Clomifene, tamoxifen, toremifene and raloxifene are generally classified as SERM in the clinical use. The main cause of postmenopausal osteoporosis is estrogen deficiency and it was revealed that the continuous combined use of conjugated estrogen and medroxyprogesterone acetate reduced the relative risk of femoral neck fracture to 0.66, however increased the relative risk of cardiovascular event and breast cancer to 1.29 or 1.26, respectively. From the standpoint of safe and clinical compliance for the breast and uterine tissue, raloxifene is recommendable for middle aged postmenopausal osteoporosis.

The bone-sparing effect of estrogens is mediated primarily via estrogen receptor (ER)α, which stimulates gene transcription through activation function (AF)-1 and AF-2. The role of ERαAF-1 for the estradiol (E2) effects is tissue specific. The selective ER modulators (SERMs) raloxifene (Ral), lasofoxifene (Las), and bazedoxifene (Bza) can be used to treat postmenopausal osteoporosis. They all reduce the risk for vertebral fractures, whereas Las and partly Bza, but not Ral, reduce the risk for nonvertebral fractures. Here, we have compared the tissue specificity of Ral, Las, and Bza and evaluated the role of ERαAF-1 for the effects of these SERMs, with an emphasis on bone parameters. We treated ovariectomized (OVX) wild-type (WT) mice and OVX mice lacking ERαAF-1 (ERαAF-1(0)) with E2, Ral, Las, or Bza. All three SERMs increased trabecular bone mass in the axial skeleton. In the appendicular skeleton, only Las increased the trabecular bone volume/tissue volume and trabecular number, whereas both Ral and Las increased the cortical bone thickness and strength. However, Ral also increased cortical porosity. The three SERMs had only a minor effect on uterine weight. Notably, all evaluated effects of these SERMs were absent in ovx ERαAF-1(0) mice. In conclusion, all SERMs had similar effects on axial bone mass. However, the SERMs had slightly different effects on the appendicular skeleton since only Las increased the trabecular bone mass and only Ral increased the cortical porosity. Importantly, all SERM effects require a functional ERαAF-1 in female mice. These results could lead to development of more specific treatments for osteoporosis.

Estrogen and selective estrogen receptor modulator (SERM) treatments for acromegaly have received limited attention since the development of newer pharmacologic therapies. There has been ongoing research evidence suggesting their utility in the biochemical control of acromegaly. Therefore, the aim of this meta-analysis was to synthesise current evidence with a view to determining to what extent and in which acromegalic patient subsets do estrogen and SERMs reduce IGF-1 levels. A literature search was conducted (finished December 2012), which included all studies pertaining to estrogen or SERM treatment and IGF-1. Seven patient subsets were identified from six published observational studies, and were pooled using meta-analytic methods. Overall, the pooled mean loss in IGF-1 was -29.09 nmol/L (95 % CI -37.23 to -20.95). A sensitivity analysis indicated that women receiving estrogen had a substantially greater reduction in IGF-1 levels compared with women receiving SERMs, with a weighted mean loss in IGF-1 of -38.12 nmol/L (95 % CI -46.78 to -29.45) compared with -22.91 nmol/L (95 % CI -32.73 to -13.09). There was a trend that did not reach statistical significance for men receiving SERM treatment at -11.41 nmol/L (95 % CI -30.14 to 7.31). It was concluded that estrogen and SERMs are a low cost and effective treatment to achieve control of IGF-1 levels in acromegalic women either as concomitant treatment for refractory disease, or where access to conventional therapy is restricted. Their use in men requires further study.

Recent advances in endocrinology open a door for clinical application of selective estrogen receptor modulator (SERM) and selective progesterone receptor modulator (SPRM) in the treatment of uterine leiomyoma. With regard to SERM, treatment with raloxifene is shown to reduce leiomyoma size in postmenopausal women. Although raloxifene causes shrinkage of leiomyomas in combination with gonadotropin-releasing hormone agonist in premenopausal women, the effects of monotherapy with raloxifene on leiomyoma growth in premenopausal women remain controversial. By contrast, tamoxifen may not be suitable for long-term treatment of leiomyomas due to an agonistic action on the endometrium. Treatment with progesterone antagonist (RU486) or SPRM (J867) has been demonstrated to inhibit leiomyoma growth and improve clinical symptoms in premenopausal women. No serious adverse effects associated with SERM or SPRM have been reported. In light of therapeutic efficacy and few adverse effects, SERM and SPRM may hold promise as novel treatment modalities for leiomyoma. Further studies are warranted to determine the optimal strategy for the treatment of leiomyoma with SERM and SPRM.

It was recently reported that the synthetic compound estren increases bone mass without affecting reproductive organs or classic transcription. The aim of the present study was to further characterize the in vivo and in vitro effects of estren. We demonstrate that estren is a selective estrogen receptor modulator (SERM) with a strong effect on thymus, a moderate effect on uterus and trabecular bone, but no major effect on fat or cortical bone in 11-month-old ovariectomized mice. The effect of estren on trabecular bone and uterus is mediated via estrogen receptors (ERs) because no effect is seen in ER double-inactivated mice. Furthermore, with the use of ERalpha- and ERbeta-expressing reporter cell lines, we demonstrate that estren displays an agonistic effect on transcriptional activity of an estrogen-responsive element-driven reporter gene with a degree of agonism similar to that of 17beta-estradiol for both ERalpha and ERbeta. Thus, estren has the capacity to exert genomic effects via both ERalpha and ERbeta. We conclude, in contrast to what was previously reported by others, that estren is a SERM with transcriptional activity.

Selective estrogen receptor modulators (SERMs) represent a class with a growing number of compounds that act as either estrogen receptor agonists or antagonists in a tissue-specific manner. This article reviews lasofoxifene, a new-generation SERM that has completed phase III development for the prevention and treatment of osteoporosis in postmenopausal women. Consistent with preclinical observations, this new SERM demonstrated improved skeletal efficacy over raloxifene and at an oral dose of 0.5 mg/day was effective in the prevention of both vertebral and nonvertebral fractures in postmenopausal women with osteoporosis. At the same dosage, lasofoxifene treatment also reduced estrogen receptor-positive breast cancer risk and the occurrence of vaginal atrophy, but, like the other SERMs, was associated with hot flushes and an increased risk of venous thromboembolic events. With its increased efficacy on the prevention of nonvertebral fractures than current available SERMs and its positive effects on the vagina, this new compound may represent an alternative and cost-effective therapy for osteoporosis in postmenopausal women.

In this review, we analyze the efficacy and safety of DT56a in the treatment of postmenopausal symptoms. Similar to all selective estrogen receptor modulators (SERMs), DT56a demonstrates dual agonistic and antagonistic effects due to the synergy between its components. DT56a is referred to as a plant-origin SERM (phyto-SERM) and, for this reason, its therapeutic capacity in postmenopausal women differs from other phytoestrogens used independently. Although interesting data on relief of vasomotor symptoms have been reported for DT56a, further clinical studies with a greater number of cases and a longer period of study are required to correctly identify its indications for use as an alternative to hormone therapy, especially in preventing osteoporosis.

Selective estrogen receptor modulators (SERMs) are a class of compounds that interact with estrogen receptors (ERs) and exert agonist or antagonist effects on ERs in a tissue-specific manner. Tamoxifen, a first generation SERM, is used for treatment of ER positive breast cancer. Raloxifene, a second generation SERM, was used to prevent postmenopausal osteoporosis. The third-generation SERM bazedoxifene (BZA) effectively prevents osteoporosis while preventing estrogenic stimulation of breast and uterus. Notably, BZA combined with conjugated estrogens (CE) is a new menopausal treatment. The menopausal state predisposes to metabolic syndrome and type 2 diabetes, and therefore the effects of SERMs on metabolic homeostasis are gaining attention. Here, we summarize knowledge of SERMs' impacts on metabolic, homeostasis, obesity and diabetes in rodent models and postmenopausal women.

Selective oestrogen receptor modulators (SERMs) are compounds that interact with the oestrogen receptor and have tissue-specific effects distinct from those of oestradiol, acting as an oestrogen agonist in some tissues and as an antagonist in others. The development of SERMs that selectively interact with specific receptors, coactivators and corepressors in different organ systems offers the possibility of improving the risk:benefit profile relative to hormone replacement therapy. Tamoxifen is a SERM that acts as an oestrogen antagonist in breast tissue and is currently being used for the treatment and prevention of breast cancer. Tamoxifen also exhibits oestrogen-agonistic properties in the endometrium and increases the risk of endometrial cancer. Oestrogen and another SERM, raloxifene, have been shown to prevent osteoporosis. The effects of oestrogens on cognitive functions are currently being investigated. Recent data reveal the lack of secondary prevention of coronary heart disease with oestrogen. Oestrogen has been used to treat menopausal symptoms, whereas the SERMs have been shown to induce hot flushes. Current research is focused on producing the ideal SERM, which would have benefits over existing SERMs in terms of preventing cancer, cardiovascular disease, osteoporosis and menopausal symptoms, improving cognitive functions, and have a significantly better toxicity profile in terms of endometrial cancer and thromboembolic events.

Postmenopausal osteoporosis is associated with lack of estrogens, therefore, understandably one of the treatment options in osteoporosis is a group of medicines known as selective estrogen receptor modulators (SERMs). They can act as an estrogen receptor agonist in some tissues, whereas as an antagonist in others. In relation to this antago-antagonistic action, SERMs have a positive effect on bones, the serum lipid profile and the cardio-vascular system. Moreover, they can protect against some estrogen-dependent neoplasm development. The first used SERM was tamoxifen, but due to its negative effect on endometrium it is not indicated in osteoporosis. Raloxifen, which is currently in use, besides the reduction of vertebral fractures risk, has beneficial influence on endometrial and breast neoplasm development risk as well. On the other hand, raloxifen intensifies vasomotor symptoms and its bone-protecting effect is limited. At present, new SERMs (ospemifen, lasofoxifen, bazedoxifen, arzoxifen) are being researched in clinical trials. In the current stage of investigations they reveal beneficial influence on skeletal as well as extraskeletal tissues. Implementation of SERMs in combined therapy of osteoporosis is currently under research as well. SERM with parathormone or SERM with bisphosphonate might prove to be an advantageous treatment option for women with severe or resistant osteoporosis. An addition of SERM to conventional hormonal replacement therapy did not bring the anticipated benefits. Future studies on SERMs may result in new preparations adjusted to individual needs of the patients.

Tamoxifen, a selective oestrogen receptor modulator (SERM), and brivanib alaninate, a vascular endothelial growth factor receptor 2 (VEGFR-2) inhibitor, are two target specific agents that result in a substantial decrease in tumour growth when given alone. Tamoxifen activates SERM stimulated breast and endometrial tumour growth. Tamoxifen and brivanib alaninate have side-effects that can affect therapeutic outcomes. The primary goal of the current study was to evaluate the therapeutic effects of lower doses of both agents when given in combination to mice with SERM sensitive, oestrogen stimulated tumour xenografts (MCF-7 E2 tumours). Experiments were conducted to evaluate the response of SERM stimulated breast (MCF-7 Tam, MCF-7 Ral) and endometrial tumours (EnCa 101) to demonstrate the activity of brivanib alaninate in SERM resistant models. In the current study, tumour xenografts were minced and bi-transplanted into the mammary fat pads of athymic, ovariectomised mice. Preliminary experiments were conducted to determine an effective oral dose of tamoxifen and brivanib alaninate that had minimal effect on tumour growth. Doses of 125 microg of tamoxifen and 0.05 mg/g of brivanib alaninate were evaluated. An experiment was designed to evaluate the effect of the two agents together when started at the time of tumour implantation. An additional experiment was done in which tumours were already established and then treated, to obtain enough tumour tissue for molecular analysis. Brivanib alaninate was effective at inhibiting tumour growth in SERM sensitive (MCF-7 E2) and SERM stimulated (EnCa 101, MCF-7 Ral, MCF-7 Tam) models. The effect of the low dose drug combination as an anti-tumour strategy for SERM sensitive (MCF-7 E2) in early treatment was as effective as higher doses of either drug used alone. In established tumours, the combination is successful at decreasing tumour growth, while neither agent alone is effective. Molecular analysis revealed a decreased phosphorylation of VEGFR-2 in tumours that were treated with brivanib alaninate and an increase in VEGFA transcription to compensate for the blockade of VEGFR-2 by increasing the transcription of VEGFA. Tamoxifen increases the phosphorylation of VEGFR-2 and this effect is abrogated by brivanib alaninate. There was also increased necrosis in tumours treated with brivanib alaninate. Historically, tamoxifen has a role in blocking angiogenesis as well as the blockade of the ER. Tamoxifen and a low dose of an angiogenesis inhibitor, brivanib alaninate, can potentially be combined not only to maximise therapeutic efficacy but also to retard SERM resistant tumour growth.

Selective estrogen receptor modulators (SERMs) are drugs that bind to the estrogen receptor (ER); in some tissues they act like estrogen (agonists), while in other tissues they oppose the action of estrogen (antagonists). The SERM tamoxifen acts as an estrogen antagonist in the breast in that it prevents and treats breast cancer, but it acts as an estrogen agonist in the endometrium, where it can induce cancer. Estrogen, and to a lesser extent SERMs, are effective in preventing and treating osteoporosis. Contrary to the prevalent hypothesis that estrogen provides benefit to women with regard to secondary prevention of coronary heart disease (CHD), randomized clinical trials have demonstrated that estrogen is associated with an increased risk of CHD in this population of women. Conflicting results have been reported on the effect of estrogens on cognitive function. The latest and largest randomized clinical trials have demonstrated a beneficial role in short-term memory in nondemented women, in contrast to the absence of such benefit in improving symptoms in women with Alzheimer's disease. Although estrogens have been used successfully to treat some menopausal symptoms such as hot flashes, the SERMs tamoxifen and raloxifene actually induce or increase hot flashes. Data on the beneficial and adverse effects of estrogen and SERMs are reported along with an elaboration of the constellation of properties that would characterize an ideal SERM working through the ER.

Tibolone, selective estrogen receptor modulators (SERMs) like tamoxifen and raloxifene, and estrogen (+/-progestogen) treatments prevent bone loss in postmenopausal women. They exert their effects on bone via the estrogen receptor (ER) and the increase in bone mass is due to resorption inhibition. The effect of SERMs on bone mineral density is less than that with the other treatments, but the SERM raloxifene still has a positive effect on vertebral fractures. In contrast to tibolone and estrogens (+/-progestogen), SERMs do not treat climacteric complaints, whilst estrogen plus progestogen treatments cause a high incidence of bleeding. Estrogen plus progestogen combinations have compromising effects on the breast. Tibolone and SERMs do not stimulate the breast or endometrium. Unlike SERMs, tibolone does not possess antagonistic biological effects via the ER in these tissues. Estrogenic stimulation in these tissues is prevented by local metabolism and inhibition of steroid metabolizing enzymes by tibolone and its metabolites. SERMs and estrogen (+/-progestogen) treatments increase the risk of venous thromboembolism (VTE), whilst estrogen (+/-progestogen) combinations have unwanted effects on cardiovascular events. So far, no detrimental effects of tibolone have been observed with respect to VTE or cardiovascular events. The clinical profile of tibolone therefore has advantages over those of other treatment modalities. It is also clear that tibolone is a unique compound with a specific mode of action and that it belongs to a separate class of compounds that can best be described as selective, tissue estrogenic activity regulators (STEARs).

Recent clinical data on selective estrogen receptor modulators (SERMs) have provided the basis for reassessment of the SERM concept. The molecular basis of SERM activity involves binding of the ligand SERM to the estrogen receptor (ER), causing conformational changes which facilitate interactions with coactivator or corepressor proteins, and subsequently initiate or suppress transcription of target genes. SERM activity is intrinsic to each ER ligand, which accomplishes its unique profile by specific interactions in the target cell, leading to tissue selective actions. We discuss the estrogenic and anti-estrogenic effects of early SERMs, such as clomiphene citrate, used for treatment of ovulation induction, and the triphenylethylene, tamoxifen, which has ER antagonist activity in the breast, and is used for prevention and treatment of ER-positive breast cancer. Since the development of tamoxifen, other triphenylethylene SERMs have been studied for breast cancer prevention, including droloxifene, idoxifene, toremifene, and ospemifene. Other SERMs have entered clinical development more recently, including benzothiophenes (raloxifene and arzoxifene), benzopyrans (ormeloxifene, levormeloxifene, and EM-800), lasofoxifene, pipendoxifene, bazedoxifene, HMR-3339, and fulvestrant, an anti-estrogen which is approved for breast cancer treatment. SERMs have effects on tissues containing ER, such as the breast, bone, uterine and genitourinary tissues, and brain, and on markers of cardiovascular risk. Current evidence indicates that each SERM has a unique array of clinical activities. Differences in the patterns of action of SERMs suggest that each clinical end point must be evaluated individually, and conclusions about any particular SERM can only be established through appropriate clinical trials.

In females, estrogens play a key role in reproduction and have beneficial effects on the skeletal, cardiovascular, and central nervous systems. Most estrogenic responses are mediated by estrogen receptors (ERs), either ER alpha or ER beta, which are members of the nuclear receptor superfamily of ligand-dependent transcription factors. Selective estrogen receptor modulators (SERMs) are ER ligands that in some tissues act like estrogens, but block estrogen action in others. Thus, SERMs may exhibit an agonistic or antagonistic biocharacter depending on the context in which their activity is examined. For example, the SERMs tamoxifen and raloxifene both exhibit ER antagonist activity in breast and agonist activity in bone, but only tamoxifen manifests agonist activity in the uterus. Numerous studies have examined the molecular basis for SERM selectivity. Collectively they indicate that different ER ligands induce distinct structural changes in the receptor that influence its ability to interact with other proteins (e.g., coactivators or corepressors) critical for the regulation of target gene transcription. The relative expression of coactivators and corepressors, and the nature of the ER and of its target gene promoter affect SERM biocharacter. Taken together, SERM selectivity reflects the diversity of ER forms and coregulators, cell type differences in their expression, and the diversity of ER target genes. This model provides a basis for understanding the molecular mechanisms of SERM action, and should help identify new SERMs with enhanced tissue or target gene selectivity.

Selective estrogen receptor modulators (SERMs) act exclusively through estrogen receptors and possess tissue-specific agonistic or antagonistic properties. The effects of all referred SERMs in bone and cardiovascular system are estrogenic, namely they inhibit postmenopausal bone loss and favorably influence plasma lipoproteins and some coagulation factors. The aim of this paper is to review the effects of SERMs on estrogen-dependent breast tissues and on the endometrium. There are two types of SERMs in clinical use, based on their chemical structure: the triphenylethylenes and the benzothiophenes. The prototype of the SERMs with triphenylethylene structure is tamoxifen. Tamoxifen, like all other SERMs, is an estrogen antagonist in the breast and is widely used for adjuvant treatment of breast cancer. A recent study suggests that tamoxifen also may prevent breast cancer in patients at risk. Because of the partial estrogenic activity of tamoxifen in the endometrium, its clinical use is associated with uterine hypertrophy and an increased risk of endometrial cancer. Other triphenylethylene SERMs, droloxifene, toremifene, and idoxifene, also show efficacy in the treatment of breast cancer, in a manner similar to tamoxifen. A better toxicology profile and a decreased endometrial estrogen agonism may be advantages of the new triphenylethylene SERMs. Raloxifene is a SERM with a chemical structure different from triphenylethylenes. Raloxifene, a benzothiophene, possesses an estrogen-antagonistic effect in the breast similar to triphenylethylenes. Clinical studies on postmenopausal osteoporotic women on raloxifene as compared with placebo show a significant decrease in the rate of newly diagnosed breast cancers. In clinical studies, in contrast to tamoxifen, no stimulatory effect in the endometrium could be observed with raloxifene.

Exploitation of the relationship between estrogen receptor (ER) structure and activity has led to the development of 1) selective ER modulators (SERM), compounds whose relative agonist/antagonist activities differ between target tissues; 2) selective ER degraders (SERD), compounds that induce a conformational change in the receptor that targets it for proteasomal degradation; and 3) tissue-selective estrogen complexes (TSEC), drugs in which a SERM and an ER agonist are combined to yield a blended activity that results in distinct clinical profiles. In this study, we have performed a comprehensive head-to-head analysis of the transcriptional activity of these different classes of ERM in a cellular model of breast cancer. Not surprisingly, these studies highlighted important functional differences and similarities among the existing SERM, selective ER degraders, and TSEC. Of particular importance was the identification of genes that were regulated by various TSEC combinations but not by an estrogen or SERM alone. Cumulatively, the findings of this analysis are informative with respect to the mechanisms by which ER is engaged by different enhancers/promoters and highlights how promoter context influences the pharmacological activity of ER ligands.

Over the past 3 decades, compounds called selective estrogen receptor modulators (SERMs) have been developed that block the estrogen receptor in some tissues (estrogen receptor antagonists) or stimulate the estrogen receptor in other tissues (estrogen receptor agonists). This Practice Pearl focuses on SERMs that clinicians can use for menopausal patients.

[PMID: 20485909]
Selective estrogen receptor modulators (SERMs) have the ability to bind the estrogen receptor (ER) and are known to confer ER agonist or antagonist effects depending on the target tissue. A number of newer SERMs, including bazedoxifene, lasofoxifene and ospemifene, are currently under clinical development for the prevention and treatment of postmenopausal osteoporosis and for other indications. Although the possibility of developing a single agent that has all of the desired characteristics of an ideal SERM seems to be unlikely, progress in the clinical development of SERMs targeted to the ER suggests that these newer compounds may have attributes that represent an improvement relative to existing SERMs. A new approach to menopausal therapy is the tissue selective estrogen complex or the pairing of a selective estrogen receptor modulator with estrogens. Further investigation will help to clarify relative benefits/risks of novel SERMs in development within specific indications.

Although best known as a selective estrogen receptor modulator (SERM), tamoxifen is a drug with a wide range of activities. Tamoxifen has demonstrated some efficacy has a therapeutic for bipolar mania and is believed to exert these effects through inhibition of protein kinase C (PKC). As the symptoms of amphetamine treatment in rodents are believed to mimic the symptoms of a manic episode, many of the preclinical studies for this indication have demonstrated that tamoxifen inhibits amphetamine action. The amphetamine-induced increase in extracellular dopamine which gives rise to the 'manic' effects is due to interaction of amphetamine with the dopamine transporter. We and others have demonstrated that PKC reduces amphetamine-induced reverse transport through the dopamine transporter. In this review, we will outline the actions of tamoxifen as a SERM and further detail another known action of tamoxifen-inhibition of PKC. We will summarize the literature showing how tamoxifen affects amphetamine action. Finally, we will present our hypothesis that tamoxifen, or an analog, could be used therapeutically to reduce amphetamine abuse in addition to treating mania.

Titanium implants are widely used on an increasing number of patients in orthopedic and dental medicine. Despite the good survival rates of these implants, failures that lead to important socio-economic consequences still exist. Recently, research aimed at improving implant fixation, a process called osseointegration, has focused on a new, innovative field: systemic delivery of drugs. Following implant fixation, patients receive systemic drugs that could either impair or enhance osseointegration; these drugs include anabolic and anti-catabolic bone-acting agents in addition to new treatments. Anabolic bone-acting agents include parathyroid hormone (PTH) peptides, simvastatin, prostaglandin EP4 receptor antagonist, vitamin D and strontium ranelate; anti-catabolic bone-acting agents include compounds like calcitonin, biphosphonates, RANK/RANKL/OPG system and selective estrogen receptor modulators (SERM). Examples of the new therapies include DKK1- and anti-sclerostin antibodies. All classes of treatments have proven to possess positive impacts such as an increase in bone mineral density and on osseointegration. In order to prevent complications from occurring after surgery, some post-operative systemic drugs are administered; these can show an impairment in the osseointegration process. These include nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, proton pump inhibitors and selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors. The effects of aspirin, acetaminophen, opioids, adjuvants, anticoagulants and antibiotics in implant fixations are not fully understood, but studies are being carried out to investigate potential ramifications. It is currently accepted that systemic pharmacological agents can either enhance or impair implant osseointegration; therefore, proper drug selection is essential. This review aims to discuss the varying effects of three different classes of treatments on improving this process.

The interaction of selective estrogen receptor modulators (SERMs) with lipid membranes has been measured at clinically relevant serum concentrations using the label-free technique of second harmonic generation (SHG). The SERMs investigated in this study include raloxifene, tamoxifen, and the tamoxifen metabolites 4-hydroxytamoxifen, N-desmethyltamoxifen, and endoxifen. Equilibrium association constants (Ka) were measured for SERMs using varying lipid compositions to examine how lipid phase, packing density, and cholesterol content impact SERM-membrane interactions. Membrane-binding properties of tamoxifen and its metabolites were compared on the basis of hydroxyl group substitution and amine ionization to elucidate how the degree of drug ionization impacts membrane partitioning. SERM-membrane interactions were probed under multiple pH conditions, and drug adsorption was observed to vary with the concentration of soluble neutral species. The agreement between Ka values derived from SHG measurements of the interactions between SERMs and artificial cell membranes and independent observations of the SERMs efficacy from clinical studies suggests that quantifying membrane adsorption properties may be important for understanding SERM action in vivo.

To provide a brief review of the history of the development of selective estrogen receptor modulators (SERMs), the current data assessing the effect of SERMs at the organ level, and the mechanism of action of these agents. All the pertinent medical literature was reviewed, and the effects of SERMs on various end-organs were summarized. SERMs have been available for clinical use since the late 1960s. By the late 1980s, several SERMs had become available that influenced clinical practice. Multiorgan effects of these compounds include variable clinical efficacy for treatment of menopausal symptoms involving the central nervous system, variable effects on the genitourinary tract, and, in general, positive effects on serum lipid levels. SERMs seem to affect bone density positively, albeit to variable degrees, depending on the agent being used. The greatest effect of SERMs has been on the breast, and current SERMs seem to have efficacy for prevention of breast cancer as opposed to the controversial effect of estrogen on the breast. Disadvantages of SERMs include exacerbation of menopausal symptoms and, as with estrogen, an increased incidence of venous thrombosis and pulmonary emboli. SERMs act by modifying the configuration of the estrogen receptor. Effects at the gene transcription level seem to be tissue specific, a factor that likely accounts for the variability of clinical action seen. SERMs are a viable option for treatment of various problems associated with menopause.

Evaluation of positive properties and side effects of raloxifene treatment with respect to its potential use as agent to improve women's health and quality of life in postmenopausal years. A review article. Obstetrics and Gynaecology Department, Charles University 2nd Medical Faculty and Teaching Hospital Motol, Prague. Estrogen use may protect against osteoporosis and cardiovascular disease, but may increase the risk of breast cancer in long-term treated women and also may increase the risk of irregular uterine bleeding (in combination with gestagen in non-hysterectomized women) in perimenopause and postmenopause. Drugs with tissue-specific estrogenic effects are termed selective estrogen receptor modulators (SERM). Tamoxifen is the first SERM successfully used in the prevention and treatment of breast cancer. Another SERM raloxifene is widely used in the prevention and treatment of postmenopausal osteoporosis, especially in women without climacteric complaints. Therapy with raloxifene increases bone mineral density, lowers serum concentrations of total and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol, and does not stimulate endometrium and breast. Evaluation of another potential positive effects (reducing size of uterine leiomyomas, etc.) warrants further investigation. Raloxifene can be used in postmenopausal women free of climacteric symptoms for the prevention and treatment of postmenopausal osteoporosis with no increased risk of thrombosis and with the advantage of positive side effects during the treatment.

In the elderly population, osteoporosis is a significant clinical problem leading to disability and even death. Many patients remain untreated, despite effective therapies, because of patients' unwillingness to take current therapies or inability to tolerate the therapies. For this reason, ongoing research continues to search for more effective and tolerable osteoporosis agents. Bazedoxifene is a selective estrogen receptor modulator (SERM) currently in development for osteoporosis prevention and treatment. A new drug application (NDA) for postmenopausal osteoporosis prevention was recently submitted to the FDA. Preclinical and clinical studies with bazedoxifene demonstrate more tissue selectivity than other SERMs. In particular, bazedoxifene has minimal if any agonist activity in the uterus and is able to antagonize effects of estrogen on the uterus. Animal studies and early clinical studies suggest effects in the bone similar to other SERMs with prevention of postmenopausal bone loss. Until more data on efficacy and safety are published, however, its role in osteoporosis is unknown.

Selective estrogen receptor modulators (SERMs), known previously as "antiestrogens", are a new category of therapeutic agents used for the prevention and treatment of diseases such as osteoporosis and breast cancer. SERMs act as ER-agonist in some tissues while acting as ER-antagonist in others based on conformational change of the receptors, particularly at the helix 12. Currently, there are two classes of clinically approved SERMs; triphenylethylene derivatives (e.g., tamoxifen) and benzothiophene derivatives (e.g., raloxifene). Tamoxifen, raloxifene and toremifene are the most widely used SERMs. Tamoxifen, an antagonist of the breast tissue, is the first clinically identified compound with noticeable SERM activity. Although tamoxifen has been very successful in breast cancer treatment, its agonistic effect on the uterus is said to be associated with increase risk of developing endometrial cancer. Ideally, it is presumed that SERMs should selectively act as an agonist in the bone and brain while simultaneously acting as an antagonist in the breast and uterus. Therefore, the therapeutic goal of SERMs is the prevention of estrogen deficiency diseases without promoting estrogen-associated tumor growth. Therefore, the objective of this review is to summarize various effects that have been applied in improving the tissue-selectivity of SERMs, highlighting the emerging understanding of their mechanism of actions in selected target tissues and the development of the SERMs. The significance in recent discovery of selective estrogen receptor alpha modulators, SERAMs will also be reviewed.

The SERMs (selective estrogen receptor modulators) are a new class of molecules that bind to the estrogen receptor, resulting in an estradiol agonist or antagonist response according to the target tissue. Raloxifene, a new SERM, has been shown to prevent postmenopausal bone loss, to reduce the risk of vertebral fractures in osteoporotic women, to decrease serum cholesterol and its LDL fraction, and to reduce significantly the risk of breat cancer. Raloxifene is available in France for the prevention of post-menopausal osteoporosis.

Selective estrogen receptor modulators (SERMs) are drugs used to treat osteoporosis. Selective estrogen receptor modulators improve bone mineral density and bone mechanical strength. However, there is a lack of data on the effect of SERMs on osteoporotic spinal fusion. This study aimed to investigate whether treatment with a SERM enhances spinal fusion in an ovariectomized (OVX) rat model. An in vivo animal study was carried out. Female Sprague Dawley rats (n=90) were OVX or sham-operated, and randomized into three groups: control (sham-operated+fusion procedure+saline administration), OVX (OVX+fusion procedure+saline administration), and SERM (OVX+fusion procedure+administration of SERM). Eight weeks after OVX, a bilateral lumbar spinal fusion procedure was performed using autologous iliac bone. In each group, gene expression was evaluated at 2, 4, and 8 weeks after the fusion procedure, histologic analysis was performed at 4 and 8 weeks after the procedure, and bone parameters were measured by micro-computed tomography at 2 days, 4 weeks, and 8 weeks after the procedure. Bone mineral density and trabecular quality of the vertebral body were significantly higher in the SERM group compared with the OVX group 16 weeks after OVX. The fusion rate and bone volume ratio were higher in the fusion bed of the SERM group compared with the OVX group 8 weeks after the fusion procedure. Real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction at 4 and 8 weeks after the fusion procedure showed increased expression of the genes for osteoblast-related markers (alkaline phosphatase, osteocalcin, runt-related transcription factor 2, and transforming growth factor) in the SERM group compared with the OVX group. The OVX group showed sparse bone mass between transverse processes. By contrast, the SERM group exhibited a compact bridging fusion mass within the fusion bed at 8 weeks after the fusion procedure. Selective estrogen receptor modulator treatment improved the trabecular quality of the vertebral body, enhanced spinal fusion, and increased the amount of compact bone mass within the fusion bed in rats that had received an ovariectomy. Therapeutic SERM treatment may be recommended to improve the fusion rate in osteoporotic patients who undergo spinal fusion.

Bone loss with aging places postmenopausal women at a higher risk for osteoporosis and its consequences such as fractures, pain, disability, and increased morbidity and mortality. Approximately 200 million patients worldwide are affected. The Third National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES III) estimated that up to 18% of US women aged 50 and older have osteoporosis and up to 50% have osteopenia. Greater than 2 million osteoporotic related fractures occurred in the United States with direct healthcare costs exceeding $17 billion. Hormone Replacement Therapy (HRT) was a popular option for postmenopausal women before the Women's Health Initiative (WHI). Several agents are available in the U.S., including bisphosphonates, hormone therapy, calcitonin, parathyroid hormone and the selective estrogen receptor modulator (SERM) raloxifene. There are concerns about long term safety and compliance. Therefore, other agents are under investigation. SERMs are a diverse group of agents that bind to the estrogen receptor and each SERM appears to have a unique set of clinical responses, which are not always consistent with the typical responses seen with other SERMs. This article will discuss the SERMs approved in the United States, tamoxifene and raloxifene, and investigational SERMs. The ideal SERM would include the beneficial effects of estrogen in bone, heart and the central nervous system, with neutral or antagonistic effects in tissues where estrogen effects are undesirable(breast and endometrium). A new target in treating postmenopausal osteoporosis is the tissue estrogen complex or the pairing of a SERM with a conjugated estrogen known as a tissue selective estrogen complex (TSEC). This novel approach is currently being evaluated with bazodoxifene which could yield the beneficial effects of estrogens and SERMS, while potentially being more tolerable and safer than either therapy alone.

Selective estrogen receptor modulators (SERMs) are structurally different compounds that interact with intracellular estrogen receptors in target organs as estrogen receptor agonists or antagonists. These drugs have been intensively studied over the past decade and have proven to be a highly versatile group for the treatment of different conditions associated with postmenopausal women's health, including hormone responsive cancer and osteoporosis. Tamoxifen, a failed contraceptive is currently used to treat all stages of breast cancer, chemoprevention in women at high risk for breast cancer and also has beneficial effects on bone mineral density and serum lipids in postmenopausal women. Raloxifene, a failed breast cancer drug, is the only SERM approved internationally for the prevention and treatment of postmenopausal osteoporosis and vertebral fractures. However, although these SERMs have many benefits, they also have some potentially serious adverse effects, such as thromboembolic disorders and, in the case of tamoxifen, uterine cancer. These adverse effects represent a major concern given that long-term therapy is required to prevent osteoporosis or prevent and treat breast cancer. The search for the 'ideal' SERM, which would have estrogenic effects on bone and serum lipids, neutral effects on the uterus, and antiestrogenic effects on breast tissue, but none of the adverse effects associated with current therapies, is currently under way. Ospemifene, lasofoxifene, bazedoxifene and arzoxifene, which are new SERM molecules with potentially greater efficacy and potency than previous SERMs, have been investigated for use in the treatment and prevention of osteoporosis. These drugs have been shown to be comparably effective to conventional hormone replacement therapy in animal models, with potential indications for an improved safety profile. Clinical efficacy data from ongoing phase III trials are available or are awaited for each SERM so that a true understanding of the therapeutic potential of these compounds can be obtained. In this article, we describe the discovery and development of the group of medicines called SERMs. The newer SERMs in late development: ospemifene, lasofoxifene, bazedoxifene, are arzoxifene are described in detail.

Selective estrogen receptor modulators (SERMs) are compounds that display mixed estrogen agonist/antagonist activity. Currently, four SERMs are licensed for clinical use: tamoxifen, toremifene, clomifene and raloxifene. The STAR and RUTH trials have provided useful data about the potential role of SERMs in the primary prevention of breast cancer and cardiovascular disease in postmenopausal women. New-generation SERMs, such as bazedoxifene, arzoxifene, lasofoxifene and ospemifene, are currently being evaluated. The aim is to find a SERM that conserves the skeleton and prevents breast cancer without increasing the risk of endometrial cancer and venous thromboembolism, and without inducing hot flushes. Technological advances in the study of estrogen receptor activation will provide key information for drug development.

A selective estrogen receptor modulator (SERM) is a nonsteroidal compound with tissue specific estrogen receptor (ER) agonist or antagonist activities. In animals, SERMs may produce morphologic changes in hormonally-sensitive tissues like the mammary gland. Mammary glands from female rats given the SERM LY2066948 hydrochloride (LY2066948) for 1 month at >or= 175 mg/kg had intralobular ducts and alveoli lined by multiple layers of vacuolated, hypertrophied epithelial cells, resembling in part the morphology of the normal male rat mammary gland. We hypothesized that these SERM-mediated changes represented an androgen-dependent virilism of the female rat mammary gland. To test this hypothesis, the androgen receptor antagonist flutamide was co-administered with LY2066948 (175 mg/kg) to female rats for 1 month. Female rats given SERM alone had hyperandrogenemia and the duct and alveolar changes described here. Flutamide cotreatment did not affect serum androgen levels but completely blocked the SERM-mediated mammary gland change. In the mouse, a species that does not have the sex-specific differences in the mammary gland observed in the rat, SERM treatment resulted in hyperandrogenemia but did not alter mammary gland morphology. These studies demonstrate that LY2066948 produces species-specific, androgen-dependent mammary gland virilism in the female rat.

The majority of breast cancers are estrogen receptor (ER) positive and depend on estrogen for growth. Therefore, blocking estrogen mediated actions remains the strategy of choice for the treatment and prevention of breast cancer. The selective estrogen receptor modulators (SERMs) are molecules that block estrogen action in breast cancer, but can still potentially maintain the beneficial effects of estrogen in other tissues, such as bone and cardiovascular system. Tamoxifen, the prototypical drug of this class has been used extensively for the past 30 years to treat and prevent breast cancer. The target of drug action, ERs alpha and beta, are the two receptors which are responsible for the first step in estrogen and SERM action. The SERM binds to the ERs and confers a unique conformation to the complex. In a target site which expresses antiestrogenic actions, the conformation of the ER is distinctly different from estrogen bound ER. The complex recruits protein partners called corepressors to prevent the transcription of estrogen responsive genes. In contrast, at a predominantly estrogenic site coactivators for estrogen action are recruited. Unfortunately at an antiestrogenic site such as breast cancer, long term SERM therapy causes the development of acquired resistance. The breast and endometrial tumor cells selectively become SERM stimulated. Overexpression of receptor tyrosine kinases, HER-2, EGFR and IGFR and the signaling cascades following their activation are frequently involved in SERM resistant breast cancers. The aberrantly activated PI3K/AKT and MAPK pathways and their cross talk with the genomic components of the ER action are implicated in SERM resistance. Other down stream factors of HER-2 and EGFR signaling, such as PI3K/AKT, MAPK or mTOR pathways has also been found to be involved in resistance mechanisms. Blocking the actions of HER-2 and EGFR represent a rational strategy for treating SERM resistant phenotypes and may in fact restore the sensitivity to the SERMs. Another approach exploits the discovery that low dose estrogen will induce apoptosis in the SERM resistant breast cancers. Numerous clinical studies are addressing these issues.

Selective estrogen receptor modulators (SERMs) are compounds that exhibit tissue-specific estrogen receptor (ER) agonist or antagonist activity, and are used for various indications, including treatment of breast cancer, osteoporosis, and menopausal symptoms. Endometrial safety has been a key differentiator between SERMs in clinical practice. For example, tamoxifen exhibits ER agonist activity in the uterus, resulting in an increased risk of endometrial hyperplasia and malignancy, whereas raloxifene and bazedoxifene have neutral effects on the uterus. Based on their efficacy and long-term safety, SERMs are increasingly being prescribed for women who cannot tolerate other treatment options and for younger women at an increased risk of fracture who may remain on therapy for long periods of time. Continuing advances in the understanding of SERM mechanisms of action and structural interactions with the ER may lead to the development of new agents and combinations of agents to provide optimal treatments to meet the varying needs of postmenopausal women. One such example is the tissue selective estrogen complex, which partners a SERM with 1 or more estrogens, with the aim of blending the desired estrogen-receptor agonist activities of estrogens on vasomotor symptoms, vulvar-vaginal atrophy, and loss of bone mass with the tissue selectivity of a SERM.
