What is the most common pediatric glioma?

[PMID: 29241176]
Gliomas are the most common type of brain cancer in the pediatric patients, constituting about 50% of all childhood intracranial tumors. This is a highly heterogeneous group, varying from the benign WHO histopathological grades I and II to malignant WHO grades III and IV. The histology and location are significant prognostic factors, which influence the decision for surgical intervention, as well as the extent of possible tumor removal. In low-grade gliomas, surgery remains the initial option and should be directed at gross total resection in favorable locations, such as the cerebral hemispheres and the cerebellum. Management of high-grade gliomas (HGG), which are less common in children compared to adults, continue to pose a significant challenge. In non-brainstem HGG, the goal is safe maximal tumor removal, while it generally does not play any role in diffuse intrinsic pontine gliomas. Treatment must, thus, be individualized in the majority of cases of HGG. Surgery for gliomas in children continues to be aided by technological advancements facilitating tumor resection and improving patient safety and outcomes.

Pilocytic astrocytoma (PA) is the most common glioma in pediatric patients and occurs in different locations. Chromosomal alterations are mostly located at chromosome 7q34 comprising the <i>BRAF</i> oncogene with consequent activation of the mitogen-activated protein kinase pathway. Although genetic and epigenetic alterations characterizing PA from different localizations have been reported, the role of epigenetic alterations in PA development is still not clear. The aim of this study was to investigate whether distinctive methylation patterns may define biologically relevant groups of PAs. Integrated DNA methylation analysis was performed on 20 PAs and 4 normal brain samples by Illumina Infinium HumanMethylation27 BeadChips. We identified distinct methylation profiles characterizing PAs from different locations (infratentorial vs supratentorial) and tumors with onset before and after 3 years of age. These results suggest that PA may be related to the specific brain site where the tumor arises from region-specific cells of origin. We identified and validated <i>in silico</i> the methylation alterations of some CpG islands. Furthermore, we evaluated the expression levels of selected differentially methylated genes and identified two biomarkers, one, <i>IRX2</i>, related to the tumor localization and the other, <i>TOX2</i>, as tumoral biomarker.

Pilocytic astrocytomas (PAs) are benign glial tumors and one of the most common childhood posterior fossa tumors. Spontaneous intratumoral hemorrhage in PAs occurs occasionally, in about 8-20% of cases. Cerebellar hemorrhages in pediatric population are rare and mainly due to head injuries, rupture of vascular malformations, infections, or hematological diseases. We have investigated the still controversial and unclear pathophysiology underlying intratumoral hemorrhage in PAs. Bleeding in low-grade tumors might be related to structural abnormalities and specific angio-architecture of tumor vessels, such as degenerative mural hyalinization, "glomeruloid" endothelial proliferation, presence of encased micro-aneurysms, and glioma-induced neoangiogenesis. The acute hemorrhagic presentation of cerebellar PA in childhood although extremely uncommon is of critical clinical importance and necessitates promptly treatment. We described a case of hemorrhagic cerebellar PA in a 9-year-old child and reviewed the English-language literature that reported spontaneous hemorrhagic histologically proven cerebellar PA in pediatric patients (0-18Â years). According to our analysis, the mortality was not related to symptom onset, tumor location, hemorrhage distribution, presence of acute hydrocephalous, and timing of surgery, while the GCS at hospital admission resulted to be the only statistically significant prognostic factor affecting survival outcome. The abrupt onset of signs and symptoms of acute hydrocephalous and consequent raised intracranial pressure are life-threatening conditions, which need emergent medical and neurosurgical treatments. At a later time, the identification of posterior fossa hemorrhage etiology is crucial to select the appropriate treatment and address the surgical strategy, optimizing the postoperative results.

High-grade gliomas (HGG) are the most common malignant brain tumors in the pediatric population and account for a large subset of all pediatric central nervous system neoplasms. The management of pediatric HGG continues to be challenging, with poor outcome in many cases despite aggressive treatments. Consequently, parallel research efforts have been focused on identifying the underlying genetic and biological basis of pediatric HGG in order to more clearly define prognostic subgroups for treatment stratification as well as identify new treatment targets. These cutting-edge advances have revolutionized pediatric neuro-oncology and have revealed novel oncogenic vulnerabilities that are being therapeutically leveraged. Promising treatments - including pathway-targeting small molecules as well as epigenetic therapy - are being evaluated in clinical trials, and recent genomic discoveries in rare glioma subgroups have led to the identification of additional new potentially-actionable alterations. This review summarizes the current state of knowledge about the molecular characterization of pediatric HGG in correlation to the revised World Health Organization (WHO) classification, as well as provides an overview of some targeted treatment approaches in the modern clinical management of high-grade gliomas.

There is controversy about the global distribution of intracranial tumors (ICTs). The previous reports from Africa suggested low frequency and different pattern of distribution of brain tumors from what obtains in other continents. The limitations at that time, including paucity of diagnostic facilities and personnel, have improved. The objective of this study is to analyze the current trend and distribution of histology confirmed brain tumors managed in Enugu, in a decade. A retrospective analysis of ICTs managed between 2006 and 2015 at Memfys Hospital, Enugu. Only cases with conclusive histology report were analyzed. The World Health Organization ICT classification was used. This study reviewed 252 patients out of 612 neuroimaging diagnosed brain tumors. Mean age was 42.8 years and male-to-female ratio was 1.2:1.0. Annual frequency increased from 11 in 2006 to 55 in 2015. Metastatic brain tumors accounted for 5.6%, and infratentorial tumors represented 16.3%. Frequency of the common primary tumors were meningioma (32.9%), glioma (23.8%), pituitary adenomas (13.5%), and craniopharyngioma (7.5%) (<i>P</i> = 0.001). Vestibular schwannoma accounted for 1.2%. Meningioma did not have gender difference (<i>P</i> = 0.714). Medulloblastoma, glioma, and craniopharyngioma were the most common pediatric tumors. About 8.7% presented unconscious (<i>P</i> < 0.001). There was no significant difference between radiology and histology diagnosis (<i>P</i> = 0.932). Meningioma is the most frequent tumor with increasing male incidence, but the frequency of glioma is increasing. Metastasis, acoustic schwannoma, lymphoma, and germ cell tumors seem to be uncommon. Late presentation is the rule.

Gliomas are the most common primary central nervous system (CNS) neoplasms in children and adolescents and are thought to arise from their glial progenitors or stem cells. Although the exact cells of origin for most pediatric gliomas remain to be identified, our current understanding is that specific cell populations during CNS development are susceptible to particular oncogenic events during certain time windows and thus give rise to pediatric gliomas with distinct histological, molecular, and clinical features. These may be roughly segregated into low-grade gliomas (WHO grades I or II; including most mixed glial-neuronal tumors) and high-grade gliomas (WHO grades III or IV) according to their clinical course when untreated, even though this is not yet entirely clear for some of the recently emerging groups. The genetic and epigenetic characterization of pediatric gliomas across ages and histologies has facilitated the delineation of biologically relevant subgroups and have revealed potentially targetable alterations in some of them. This review outlines diagnostic features and molecular alterations in pediatric low- and high-grade gliomas and how the latter might be exploited with future targeted therapeutic strategies.

Gliomas are the most common malignant primary brain tumors, of which glioblastoma is the most malignant form (WHO grade IV), and notorious for treatment resistance. Over the last decade mutations in epigenetic regulator genes have been identified as key drivers of subtypes of gliomas with distinct clinical features. Most characteristic are mutations in IDH1 or IDH2 in lower grade gliomas, and histone 3 mutations in pediatric high grade gliomas that are also associated with characteristic DNA methylation patterns. Furthermore, in adult glioblastoma patients epigenetic silencing of the DNA repair gene MGMT by promoter methylation is predictive for benefit from alkylating agent therapy. These epigenetic alterations are used as biomarkers and play a central role for classification of gliomas (WHO 2016) and treatment decisions. Here we review the pivotal role of epigenetic alterations in the etiology and biology of gliomas. We summarize the complex interactions between "driver" mutations, DNA methylation, histone post-translational modifications, and overall chromatin organization, and how they inform current efforts of testing epigenetic compounds and combinations in preclinical and clinical studies.
