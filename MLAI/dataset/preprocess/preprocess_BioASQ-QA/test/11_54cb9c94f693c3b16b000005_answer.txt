IDEAL_ANSWER:
- SERCA2a activity is regulated by phosphorylation of another SR protein, Phospholamban (PLN). Phospholamban (PLB) inhibits the activity of SERCA2a, the Ca(2+)-ATPase in cardiac sarcoplasmic reticulum, by decreasing the apparent affinity of the enzyme for Ca(2+).

EXACT_ANSWER:
- Phospholamban
- PLN
- plb
