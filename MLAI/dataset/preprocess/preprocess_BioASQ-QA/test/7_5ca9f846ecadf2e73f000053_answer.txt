IDEAL_ANSWER:
- The gas vesicle wall is solely formed of proteins with the two major components, GvpA and GvpC, and
- The gas vesicle wall is solely formed of proteins with the two major components, GvpA and GvpC, and seven additional accessory proteins are also involved.
- Gas vesicles are proteinaceous, gas-filled nanostructures produced by some bacteria and archaea. The hydrophobic major structural protein GvpA forms the ribbed gas vesicle wall.
- The gas vesicle wall is solely formed of proteins with the two major components, GvpA and GvpC,
- the gas vesicle wall is solely formed of proteins with the two major components, gvpa and gvpc,

EXACT_ANSWER:
- GvpA forms the gas vesicle wall
