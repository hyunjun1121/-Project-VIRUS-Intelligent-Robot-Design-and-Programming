Aducanumab can be used for treatment of which disease?

[PMID: 34506904]
The amyloid-β (Aβ) oligomer hypothesis of Alzheimer's disease (AD) still dominates the field, yet the clinical trial evidence does not robustly support it. A falsifiable prediction of the hypothesis is that Aβ oligomer levels should be elevated in the brain regions and at the disease stages where and when neuron death and synaptic protein loss begin and are the most severe, but we review previous evidence to demonstrate that this is not consistently the case. To rescue the Aβ oligomer hypothesis from falsification, we propose the novel ad-hoc hypothesis that the exceptionally vulnerable hippocampus may normally produce Aβ peptides even in healthily aging individuals, and hippocampal oxidatively damaged DNA, pathogen DNA, and metal ions such as zinc may initiate and drive Aβ peptide aggregation into oligomers and spreading, neuron death, synaptic dysfunction, and other aspects of AD neurodegeneration. We highlight additional evidence consistent with the underwhelming efficacy of Aβ oligomer-lowering agents, such as aducanumab, and of antioxidants, such as vitamin E, versus the so far isolated case report that DNase-I treatment for 2 months resulted in a severe AD patient's Mini-Mental State Exam score increasing from 3 to 18, reversing his diagnosis to moderate AD, according to the Mini-Mental State Exam.

Aducanumab, a human monoclonal antibody, was approved in June of 2021 as the first disease-modifying treatment for Alzheimer's disease by the United States Food and Drug Administration (U.S. FDA). A substantial proportion of patients with Alzheimer's disease live in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs), and the debilitating effects of this disease exerts burdens on patients and caregivers in addition to the significant economic strains many nations bear. While the advantages of a disease-modifying therapy are clear in delaying the progression of disease to improve patient outcomes, aducanumab's approval by the U.S. FDA was met with controversy for a plethora of reasons. This paper will provide precursory insights into aducanumab's role, appropriateness, and cost-effectiveness in low- and middle-income countries. We extend some of the controversies associated with aducanumab, including the contradicting evidence from the two trials (EMERGE and ENGAGE) and the resources required to deliver the treatment safely and effectively to patients, among other key considerations.

The recent approval of aducanumab for Alzheimer's disease has heightened the interest in therapies targeting the amyloid hypothesis. Our research has focused on identification of novel compounds to improve amyloid processing by modulating gamma secretase activity, thereby addressing a significant biological deficit known to plague the familial form of the disease. Herein, we describe the design, synthesis, and optimization of new gamma secretase modulators (GSMs) based on previously reported oxadiazine <b>1</b>. Potency improvements with a focus on predicted and measured properties afforded high-quality compounds further differentiated via robust Aβ<sub>42</sub> reductions in both rodents and nonhuman primates. Extensive preclinical profiling, efficacy studies, and safety studies resulted in the nomination of FRM-024, (+)-<i>cis</i>-5-(4-chlorophenyl)-6-cyclopropyl-3-(6-methoxy-5-(4-methyl-1<i>H</i>-imidazole-1-yl)pyridin-2-yl)-5,6-dihydro-4<i>H</i>-1,2,4-oxadiazine, as a GSM preclinical candidate for familial Alzheimer's disease.

On June 7, 2021, the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved aducanumab, a monoclonal amyloid targeting β-amyloid, for the treatment for Alzheimer's disease (AD). This decision was achieved through the Accelerated Approval Pathway and was essentially motivated by the evidence that aducanumab reduces brain amyloid plaques. This news is causing a heated debate in the scientific community. On the one hand, aducanumab is the first drug to be approved for the treatment of the disease since 2003 and is the first drug to act on the alleged pathophysiological mechanisms of AD. At the same time, the evidence of clinical benefit coming from two phase 3 clinical trials is contradictory and still inconclusive. The aim of the present editorial is to provide some points to consider that can help understand the peculiarities and implications of this approval and feed the scientific debate underway.

Aducanumab (aducanumab-avwa; Aduhelm™) is a human, immunoglobulin gamma 1 (IgG1) monoclonal antibody directed against aggregated soluble and insoluble forms of amyloid β. It has been co-developed by Biogen and Eisai under license from Neurimmune for the treatment of Alzheimer's disease. In June 2021, aducanumab received its first approval in the USA for the treatment of Alzheimer's disease. According to the US FDA prescribing information, treatment should be initiated in patients with mild cognitive impairment or mild dementia stage of disease, the population in which treatment was initiated in clinical trials. There are no safety or effectiveness data on initiating treatment at earlier or later stages of the disease than were studied. Aducanumab is under regulatory review in Japan and in Europe. Its long-term safety and tolerability is being evaluated in a multinational phase 3b clinical study in patients with early Alzheimer's disease (mild cognitive impairment and mild Alzheimer's disease). This article summarizes the milestones in the development of aducanumab leading to this first approval for Alzheimer's disease.

Aducanumab, a human-derived antibody targeting amyloid-β (Aβ), is in Phase 3 clinical trials for the treatment of Alzheimer's disease. Biochemical and structural analyses show that aducanumab binds a linear epitope formed by amino acids 3-7 of the Aβ peptide. Aducanumab discriminates between monomers and oligomeric or fibrillar aggregates based on weak monovalent affinity, fast binding kinetics and strong avidity for epitope-rich aggregates. Direct comparative studies with analogs of gantenerumab, bapineuzumab and solanezumab demonstrate clear differentiation in the binding properties of these antibodies. The crystal structure of the Fab fragment of aducanumab bound to its epitope peptide reveals that aducanumab binds to the N terminus of Aβ in an extended conformation, distinct from those seen in structures with other antibodies that target this immunodominant epitope. Aducanumab recognizes a compact epitope that sits in a shallow pocket on the antibody surface. In silico analyses suggest that aducanumab interacts weakly with the Aβ monomer and may accommodate a variety of peptide conformations, further supporting its selectivity for Aβ aggregates. Our studies provide a structural rationale for the low affinity of aducanumab for non-pathogenic monomers and its greater selectivity for aggregated forms than is seen for other Aβ-targeting antibodies.

Alzheimer's disease and Lewy body diseases are the most common causes of neurodegeneration and dementia. Amyloid-beta (Aβ) and alpha-synuclein (αSyn) are two key proteins involved in the pathogenesis of these neurodegenerative diseases. Immunotherapy aims to reduce the harmful effects of protein accumulation by neutralising toxic species and facilitating their removal. The results of the first immunisation trial against Aβ led to a small percentage of meningoencephalitis cases which revolutionised vaccine design, causing a shift in the field of immunotherapy from active to passive immunisation. While the vast majority of immunotherapies have been developed for Aβ and tested in Alzheimer's disease, the field has progressed to targeting other proteins including αSyn. Despite showing some remarkable results in animal models, immunotherapies have largely failed final stages of clinical trials to date, with the exception of Aducanumab recently licenced in the US by the FDA. Neuropathological findings translate quite effectively from animal models to human trials, however, cognitive and functional outcome measures do not. The apparent lack of translation of experimental studies to clinical trials suggests that we are not obtaining a full representation of the effects of immunotherapies from animal studies. Here we provide a background understanding to the key concepts and challenges involved in therapeutic design. This review further provides a comprehensive comparison between experimental and clinical studies in Aβ and αSyn immunotherapy and aims to determine the possible reasons for the disconnection in their outcomes.

The amyloid hypothesis has been the dominant framework for Alzheimer's disease (AD) research, including the development of anti-AD therapies. However, none of the phase III clinical trials conducted to date that targeted amyloid β (Aβ) production, aggregation, or clearance demonstrated a statistically significant treatment effect in patients with AD. This includes the approach of using monoclonal antibodies that recognize various Aβ epitopes and display different binding selectivity. While some monoclonal antibodies have failed in phase III trials, several are still in development. Aducanumab (BIIB037) is a human antibody that selectively targets aggregated forms of Aβ, including soluble oligomers and insoluble fibrils. In PRIME (NCT01677572), an ongoing phase Ib trial (N=196 patients dosed), aducanumab was shown to reduce Aβ plaques and slow decline in clinical measures in patients with prodromal or mild AD, with acceptable safety and tolerability. The main safety finding was amyloid-related imaging abnormalities (ARIA), a side effect associated with removal of Aβ, which was dose-dependent and occurred more often in ApoE ε4 carriers than non-carriers. ENGAGE (NCT02477800) and EMERGE (NCT02484547), the ongoing phase III trials of aducanumab in early AD, have been designed based on the outcomes of PRIME and on lessons from past clinical trials in patients with AD. Those study design features include patient selection with confirmed Aβ pathology, ensuring sufficient target engagement, and conducting clinical trials in patients at earlier symptomatic stages of AD.

Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the most common cause for dementia worldwide. Until recently, all approved treatments for AD were symptomatic and not disease modifying. On 7 June 2021, the US FDA approved aducanumab, a human IgG1 anti-Aβ monoclonal antibody selective for Aβ aggregates, as the first disease-modifying treatment for AD. Aducanumab is approved in the United States for the treatment of mild cognitive impairment or mild-dementia stage of AD. In this Editorial, we review the trial data for aducanumab in the treatment of AD and the controversies that its approval has generated.

On 7 June 2021, aducanumab was granted accelerated approval for the treatment of Alzheimer disease (AD) by the FDA on the basis of amyloid-lowering effects considered reasonably likely to confer clinical benefit. This decision makes aducanumab the first new drug to be approved for the treatment of AD since 2003 and the first drug to ever be approved for modification of the course of AD. Many have questioned how scientific evidence, expert advice and the best interests of patients and families were considered in the approval decision. In this article, we argue that prior to approval, the FDA and Biogen's shared interpretation of clinical trial data - that high-dose aducanumab was substantially clinically effective - avoided conventional scientific scrutiny, was prominently advanced by patient representative groups who had been major recipients of Biogen funds, and raised concerns that safeguards were insufficient to mitigate regulatory capture within the FDA. Here, we reflect on events leading to the FDA's decision on 7 June 2021 and consider whether any lessons can be learned for the field.

Aducanumab recently underwent two large phase III clinical trials that were stopped prematurely by the sponsor Biogen. One trial was trending positive while the other showed no benefits from aducanumab. Post hoc analyses led the sponsor to assert that there was a sufficient efficacy signal to justify a new drug application as a treatment for Alzheimer's disease. The sponsor claimed that subsets of participants receiving sufficiently high doses of aducanumab demonstrated benefits in both trials. In contrast, we identified alternative accounts for the apparent drug benefits in post hoc subgroups that are unrelated to dose effects. Biomarker data were consistent with target engagement, but no evidence was presented to correlate biomarker changes to cognitive benefits. Our analysis supports the conduct of a third, phase III trial with high-dose aducanumab. Aducanumab's efficacy as a treatment for the cognitive dysfunction in Alzheimer's disease cannot be proven by clinical trials with divergent outcomes.

Aducanumab has been approved by the US Food and Drug Administration for treatment of Alzheimer's disease (AD). Clinicians require guidance on the appropriate use of this new therapy. An Expert Panel was assembled to construct Appropriate Use Recommendations based on the participant populations, conduct of the pivotal trials of aducanumab, updated Prescribing Information, and expert consensus. Aducanumab is an amyloid-targeting monoclonal antibody delivered by monthly intravenous infusions. The pivotal trials included patients with early AD (mild cognitive impairment due to AD and mild AD dementia) who had confirmed brain amyloid using amyloid positron tomography. The Expert Panel recommends that use of aducanumab be restricted to this population in which efficacy and safety have been studied. Aducanumab is titrated to a dose of 10 mg/kg over a 6-month period. The Expert Panel recommends that the aducanumab be titrated to the highest dose to maximize the opportunity for efficacy. Aducanumab can substantially increase the incidence of amyloid-related imaging abnormalities (ARIA) with brain effusion or hemorrhage. Dose interruption or treatment discontinuation is recommended for symptomatic ARIA and for moderate-severe ARIA. The Expert Panel recommends MRIs prior to initiating therapy, during the titration of the drug, and at any time the patient has symptoms suggestive of ARIA. Recommendations are made for measures less cumbersome than those used in trials for the assessment of effectiveness in the practice setting. The Expert Panel emphasized the critical importance of engaging in a process of patient-centered informed decision-making that includes comprehensive discussions and clear communication with the patient and care partner regarding the requirements for therapy, the expected outcome of therapy, potential risks and side effects, and the required safety monitoring, as well as uncertainties regarding individual responses and benefits.

Alzheimer's disease (AD) is an irreversible brain disorder associated with severe progressive dementia and is characterized by deposits of amyloid plaques in the brain. Over the past 20 years, the mortality of strokes and heart disease has decreased, but deaths from AD have increased. The four drugs used clinically to treat AD can only relieve symptoms but cannot slow the progression of the disease. Aducanumab, a human monoclonal antibody that preferentially binds to aggregated amyloid-β to reduce the number of amyloid plaques and slow disease progression, was approved to treat AD by the US Food and Drug Administration on June 7, 2021. It is the first disease-modifying therapy for AD, but there is considerable controversy regarding the drug's approval. Aducanumab offers hope for millions of patients.

Aducanumab is an anti-amyloid-β (Aβ) antibody that achieved reduced amyloid pathology in Alzheimer's disease (AD) trials; however, it is controversial whether it also improved cognition, which has been suggested would require a sufficiently high cumulative dose of the antibody in the brain. Therapeutic ultrasound, in contrast, has only begun to be investigated in human AD clinical trials. We have previously shown that scanning ultrasound in combination with intravenously injected microbubbles (SUS), which temporarily and safely opens the blood-brain barrier (BBB), removes amyloid and restores cognition in APP23 mice. However, there has been no direct testing of how the effects of SUS compare to immunotherapy or whether a combination therapy is more effective. In a study comprising four treatment arms, we tested the efficacy of an Aducanumab analog, Adu, both in comparison to SUS, and as a combination therapy, in APP23 mice (aged 13-22 months), using sham as a control. The active place avoidance (APA) test was used to test spatial memory, and histology and ELISA were used to measure amyloid. Brain antibody levels were also determined. We found that both Adu and SUS reduced the total plaque area in the hippocampus with no additive effect observed with the combination treatment (SUS + Adu). Whereas in the cortex where there was a trend towards reducing the total plaque area from either Adu or SUS, only the combination treatment yielded a statistically significant decrease in total plaque area compared to sham. Only the SUS and SUS + Adu groups included animals that had their plaque load reduced to below 1% from above 10%. There was a robust improvement in spatial memory for the SUS + Adu group only, and in this group the level of Adu, when measured 3 days post-treatment, was 5-fold higher compared to those mice that received Adu on its own. Together, these findings suggest that SUS should be considered as a treatment option for AD. Alternatively, a combination trial using Aducanumab together with ultrasound to increase brain levels of the antibody may be warranted.

Aducanumab is a human immunoglobulin G1 anti-amyloid beta (Aβ) antibody currently being evaluated for potential treatment of patients with early Alzheimer's disease. This paper describes the relationship between the population pharmacokinetics (PopPKs) and pharmacokinetics-pharmacodynamics (PKs-PDs) of aducanumab using data from phase I to III clinical studies, with standard uptake value ratio (SUVR) used as a PD marker. Across clinical studies, aducanumab was administered intravenously either as a single dose ranging from 0.3 to 60 mg/kg or as multiple doses of 1, 3, 6, or 10 mg/kg every 4 weeks. A titration regimen with maintenance doses of 3, 6, or 10 mg/kg was also evaluated. Aducanumab PK was characterized with a two-compartment model with first-order elimination. No nonlinearities in PKs were observed. The PopPK-PD model was developed using a sequential estimation approach. The time course of amyloid plaques, as expressed by composite SUVR measured using positron emission tomography, was described using an indirect response model with drug effect stimulating the elimination of SUVR. None of the identified covariates on PK and the PopPK-PD model were clinically relevant. The PopPK-PD model showed that magnitude, duration, and consistency of dosing are important factors determining the degree of Aβ removal. The intrinsic pharmacology of aducanumab remained consistent across studies.

Aducanumab (BIIB037), a human monoclonal antibody selective for aggregated forms of amyloid beta, is being investigated as a disease-modifying treatment for Alzheimer's disease (AD). This randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled single ascending-dose study investigated the safety, tolerability, and pharmacokinetics (PK) of aducanumab in patients with mild-to-moderate AD. Eligible patients were sequentially randomized 6:2 to aducanumab (0.3, 1, 3, 10, 20, 30, and 60 mg/kg) or placebo. The primary outcome was safety and tolerability. Doses ≤30 mg/kg were generally well tolerated with no severe or serious adverse events (SAEs). All three patients who received 60 mg/kg aducanumab developed SAEs of symptomatic amyloid-related imaging abnormalities, which completely resolved by weeks 8-15. Aducanumab C<sub>max</sub>, AUC<sub>0-last</sub>, and AUC<sub>inf</sub> increased in a dose-proportional manner. In this single-dose study, aducanumab demonstrated an acceptable safety and tolerability profile and linear PK at doses ≤30 mg/kg (clinicaltrials.govNCT01397539).

The pipeline for new treatments for Alzheimer's disease (AD) in the USA contains over 100 different agents, 80% of which can be categorized as disease-modifying therapies. The regulatory approval of the disease-modifying agent aducanumab has brought more attention to the complexity of the diagnosis, evaluation, and treatment of AD and the difficult decisions payers and policy makers will face over the next few years as innovation continues in this space. The value of AD treatment can vary widely according to the perspective of the analysis, sources of data, and methodological approach for the value assessment. This article focuses on AD-specific data gaps and measurement challenges and provides guidance for evidence generation to facilitate better value assessments for future AD treatments.

Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the most common form of dementia with global burden projected to triple by 2050. It incurs significant biopsychosocial burden worldwide with limited treatment options. Aducanumab is the first monoclonal antibody recently approved by the US-FDA for mild AD through the accelerated approval pathway. It is the first molecule to be approved for AD since 2003 and carries with it a therapeutic promise for the future. As the definition of AD has evolved from a pathological entity to a Clinico-biological construct over the years, the amyloid-β (Aβ) pathway has been increasingly implicated in its pathogenesis. The approval of Aducanumab is based on reduction of the Aβ load in the brain, which forms a surrogate marker for this pathway. The research populace has, however, been globally divided by skepticism and hope regarding this approval. Failure to meet clinical endpoints in the trials, alleged transparency issues, cost-effectiveness, potential adverse effects, need for regular monitoring, and critique of 'amyloid cascade hypothesis' itself are the main caveats concerning the antibody. With this controversy in background, this paper critically looks at antibody research in AD therapeutics, evidence, and evolution of Aducanumab as a drug and the potential clinical implications of its use in future. While the efficacy of this monoclonal antibody in AD stands as a test of time, based on the growing evidence it is vital to rethink and explore alternate pathways of pathogenesis (oxidative stress, neuroinflammation, cholesterol metabolism, vascular factors, etc.) as possible therapeutic targets that may help elucidate the enigma of this complex yet progressive and debilitating neurodegenerative disorder.

Aducanumab (Aduhelm), the first new drug to treat Alzheimer's disease since 2003, has received accelerated approval from the Food and Drug Administration (FDA).This drug's approval has been highly contentious in the medical and scientific community owing to contradictory study findings and the FDA's advisory panel not recommending its approval.

Based on the reduction of amyloid β plaques, US FDA has recently approved Aducanumab as a disease modifying treatment for Alzheimer's disease (AD). With high pricing and the potential risks likely with this treatment, certainty of AD diagnosis becomes crucial. The current pilot study evaluated plasma levels of neurofilament L, an axonal injury marker and amyloid β42, a major component of amyloid plaques for discriminating AD from non-AD dementia (NAD). Results with Simoa assays indicate that a combination of neurofilament L and amyloid β42 can be considered as a screening tool in identifying eligible subjects for AD treatment/ clinical trials.

Alzheimer's disease (AD) is characterized by deposition of amyloid-β (Aβ) plaques and neurofibrillary tangles in the brain, accompanied by synaptic dysfunction and neurodegeneration. Antibody-based immunotherapy against Aβ to trigger its clearance or mitigate its neurotoxicity has so far been unsuccessful. Here we report the generation of aducanumab, a human monoclonal antibody that selectively targets aggregated Aβ. In a transgenic mouse model of AD, aducanumab is shown to enter the brain, bind parenchymal Aβ, and reduce soluble and insoluble Aβ in a dose-dependent manner. In patients with prodromal or mild AD, one year of monthly intravenous infusions of aducanumab reduces brain Aβ in a dose- and time-dependent manner. This is accompanied by a slowing of clinical decline measured by Clinical Dementia Rating-Sum of Boxes and Mini Mental State Examination scores. The main safety and tolerability findings are amyloid-related imaging abnormalities. These results justify further development of aducanumab for the treatment of AD. Should the slowing of clinical decline be confirmed in ongoing phase 3 clinical trials, it would provide compelling support for the amyloid hypothesis.
