What antibiotic is currently used as the standard of care for Clostridium Difficile infection as of 2018

[PMID: 27601193]
Recurrences of Clostridium difficile infections lead to hospital readmissions and high costs, in addition to the suffering and frustration for the patients. Fidaxomicin has recently been introduced as a new antibiotic that has been shown to significantly reduce the recurrence of this infection. Despite this superiority, its high cost has led to very restrictive policies in its use, as such that many institutions only use it in patients with multiple recurrences. While waiting for new predictive clinical tools, we propose the development of scoring systems that allow the more high-risk patients to be treated earlier.

Fidaxomicin is a new antibiotic used to treat Clostridium difficile infection (CDI). Given limited clinical experience with fidaxomicin, we assessed outcomes in a diverse cohort of patients with CDI treated with fidaxomicin. All CDI cases treated with fidaxomicin at 3 referral centers over a 4-year period were included. Response was defined as resolution of diarrhea and recurrence was defined by recurrence of CDI within 8 weeks of the end of treatment. Overall, 81 patients (median age 55.9 y; 53% female; 26% with inflammatory bowel disease) were included. Response occurred in 90%. Responders had fewer prior CDI episodes [median 1 (range, 0 to 8)] than nonresponders [median 2.5 (range, 1 to 8)], P=0.01. Response after a first CDI episode was 100%, 96% after 1 prior episode, and 82% after 2 or more, P=0.02. Recurrence occurred in 19%. Patients without recurrence had fewer prior episodes of CDI [median 1 (range, 0 to 6)] than patients who recurred [median 2 (range, 1 to 8)], P=0.005. Recurrence after a first episode was 0%, 23% after 1 prior episode, and 29% after 2 or more, P=0.005. All patients with inflammatory bowel disease responded either with improvement of symptoms or a negative C. difficile test; 19% recurred. All patients with a first CDI episode treated with fidaxomicin responded with no recurrences. Patients with prior CDI episodes were less likely to respond (especially with more than 1 prior episode) and more likely to recur, suggesting a greater clinical benefit of fidaxomicin earlier in the course of CDI.
