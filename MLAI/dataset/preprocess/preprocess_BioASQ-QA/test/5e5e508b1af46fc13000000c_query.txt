What does Retapamulin treat?

[PMID: 20066388]
In atopic dermatitis (AD), the stratum corneum of patients appears to have alterations that predispose them to colonization and invasion by various bacteria, most notably Staphylococcus aureus (S. aureus). This bacterial co-existence is accepted to be an important factor in AD disease activity. Exactly when to initiate antimicrobial treatment is controversial, but such intervention, when warranted, has repeatedly been demonstrated to improve the course of AD. However, the increase in antibiotic resistance presents a therapeutic challenge in the management of AD patients, which highlights the need for novel mechanism topical antibacterial agents. Retapamulin is a relatively new pleuromutilin antibiotic designed for topical use. In vitro studies have demonstrated its low potential for the development of antibacterial resistance and high degree of potency against Gram-positive bacteria found in skin infections, including many S. aureus strains that are resistant to methicillin, fusidic acid, and mupirocin. Clinical studies exploring the treatment of secondarily infected dermatitis reveal that the efficacy of topical retapamulin is comparable to a 10-day course of oral cephalexin or to topical fusidic acid. Retapamulin appears to be a much needed antimicrobial option for treating the AD population due to their common carriage of bacterial pathogens and frequency of infectious complications.

Retapamulin is a new topical pleuromutilin antibiotic for the treatment of skin and skin-structure infections, including impetigo. In vitro studies indicate that retapamulin has a unique mode of action that minimizes the potential for target-specific cross-resistance with other antibacterials and a limited potential for resistance development. Its spectrum of activity includes the most likely causative pathogens Staphylococcus aureus and Streptococcus pyogenes. In the Global Surveillance Program, retapamulin was highly active in vitro, including against strains of S. aureus resistant to methicillin, mupirocin or fusidic acid. In clinical studies, retapamulin was noninferior to fusidic acid and oral cefalexin, achieving per-pathogen success rates of 86-99%. Topical retapamulin has a good safety profile and is associated with high patient compliance.

Retapamulin is a novel, topical antibacterial of the pleuromutilin class in development for the treatment of secondarily infected traumatic lesions of the skin. The efficacy, safety, and tolerability of topical retapamulin ointment, 1% for 5 days twice daily was evaluated in 2 identical, randomized, double-blind, double-dummy, multicenter studies vs oral cephalexin, 500 mg twice daily for 10 days, in 1904 patients with secondarily infected traumatic lesions. Clinical success rates were 89.5% in protocol-adherent patients receiving retapamulin compared with 91.9% for cephalexin (treatment difference, -2.5% [95% confidence interval, -5.4% to 0.5%]). In patients with Staphylococcus aureus or Streptococcus pyogenes at baseline, clinical success was 89.2% (365/409) for retapamulin and 92.6% (63/68) for cephalexin. Safety and tolerability were similar between treatments. Noncompliance (defined as using or taking <80% of doses) was recorded in 8.0% (51/636) of patients taking cephalexin compared with 0.39% (5/1268) of patients receiving retapamulin. Retapamulin offers a novel, effective, and convenient topical treatment for secondarily infected traumatic lesions.

Cutaneous bacterial infections are common in children and adults and frequently are caused by <i>Staphylococcus aureus</i> (<i>S. aureus</i>). Treatment failures with topical agents are not uncommon and have been shown to be secondary to bacterial resistance. To determine clinical and bacteriological efficacy of retapamulin ointment 1% in treatment of patients with cutaneous bacterial infections caused by methicillin-resistant <i>S. aureus</i> (MRSA) and other bacteria. Prospective, nonrandomized, uncontrolled, open label, single center trial conducted between April 2008 and November 2012 that evaluated efficacy of retapamulin ointment 1% in the treatment of impetigo, folliculitis, and other minor soft tissue infections in children and adults. Fifty patients, who presented to a dermatology outpatient clinic and were clinically diagnosed with impetigo, folliculitis, or minor soft tissue infection suitable for treatment with a topical antibiotic, were screened. Thirty-eight patients were enrolled and received treatment: topical retapamulin ointment 1% twice daily for 5 days. Seven patients were MRSA positive and qualified for the primary efficacy population. One patient withdrew due to an adverse event. Clinical and microbiological exams were performed at baseline and follow-up 5 to 7 days later to assess clinical, microbiological, and therapeutic responses. Primary outcome was clinical response at follow-up in primary efficacy population with MRSA isolated as the baseline pathogen. Secondary outcomes included clinical, microbiologic, and therapeutic responses in patients who were culture positive for any species of bacteria. Clinical response at follow-up in the primary efficacy population (MRSA-positive patients) was not sufficiently powered to demonstrate significance; however, outcomes were excellent, with 7 of 7 patients demonstrating clinical success (5 of 7) or clinical improvement (2 of 7) at follow-up. Barring lack of significance due to small total sample size for patients who were culture positive for any species of bacteria (<i>n</i> = 35), overall success rates were favorable for clinical, microbiologic, and therapeutic responses with values of 66%, 97%, and 69%, respectively. Adverse events (AEs) were mild or moderate in severity. No serious AEs were reported. Safety profile appears favorable given the low number of AEs. Study design limits conclusions that can be drawn. Nevertheless, this study supports use of topical retapamulin 1% ointment in treatment of cutaneous bacterial infections, particularly those caused by <i>S. aureus</i>, including MRSA.

Topical retapamulin (Altabax, Altargo) is the first pleuromutilin antibacterial approved for the treatment of uncomplicated superficial skin infections caused by Staphylococcus aureus (excluding meticillin-resistant S. aureus [MRSA]) and Streptococcus pyogenes in patients aged > or = 9 months. In the EU, retapamulin is indicated for use in patients with impetigo or with infected small lacerations, abrasions or sutured wounds (without abscesses); in the US, it is indicated for use in patients with impetigo. Retapamulin has a novel site of action on bacterial ribosomes. In clinical trials in patients with impetigo, topical retapamulin 1% ointment twice daily for 5 days (the approved regimen) was superior to placebo; treatment with retapamulin was noninferior to that with topical fusidic acid. In patients with secondarily infected traumatic lesions, treatment with retapamulin was noninferior to that with oral cefalexin, although the efficacy of retapamulin was reduced in patients with MRSA infections or superficial abscesses. Retapamulin was well tolerated in both paediatric and adult patients, and the majority of adverse events were of mild to moderate severity. Thus, the introduction of topical retapamulin 1% ointment extends the treatment options available in the management of impetigo and uncomplicated secondarily infected traumatic lesions.

Retapamulin, the first pleuromutilin antimicrobial agent approved for the topical treatment of skin infections in humans, was tested against 987 clinical isolates representing 30 species and/or resistance groups. MICs were determined along with disk diffusion zone diameters using a 2-microg disk. Population distribution and MIC versus disk zone diameter scattergrams were analyzed to determine microbiological MIC cutoff values and inhibition zone correlates. Minimum bactericidal concentrations were performed on a smaller subset of key species. The retapamulin MIC(90) against 234 Staphylococcus aureus isolates and 110 coagulase-negative staphylococci was 0.12 microg/ml. Retapamulin MIC(90)s ranged from 0.03 to 0.06 microg/ml against beta-hemolytic streptococci including 102 Streptococcus pyogenes, 103 Streptococcus agalactiae, 59 group C Streptococcus, and 71 group G Streptococcus isolates. The MIC(90) against 55 viridans group streptococci was 0.25 microg/ml. Retapamulin had very little activity against 151 gram-negative bacilli and most of the Enterococcus species tested. Based on the data from this study, for staphylococci, MICs of <or=0.5, 1, and >or=2 microg/ml with corresponding disk diffusion values of >or=20 mm, 17 to 19 mm, and <or=16 mm can be proposed for susceptible, intermediate, and resistant microbiological cutoffs, respectively. For beta-hemolytic streptococci, a susceptible-only MIC of <or=0.25 microg/ml with a corresponding disk diffusion value of >or=15 mm can be proposed for susceptible-only microbiological cutoffs.

Retapamulin, a topical pleuromutilin that selectively inhibits bacterial protein synthesis, is approved for treatment of impetigo and secondarily infected traumatic lesions in adults and in children older than 9 months of age. A 5-year study was conducted to monitor prescription use in children younger than 9 months of age. Annual prescription events were monitored in the UK Clinical Practice Research Datalink (CPRD) and the Clinformatics™ DataMart Multiplan (IMPACT), a product of OptumInsight Life Sciences, Inc. (Eden Prairie, MN, USA), from the USA. In the CPRD, of 148 prescriptions, three (2 %) were identified in children aged less than 9 months between years 2008 and 2011. In IMPACT, of 59,210 claims for retapamulin in children, 1,951 (3.3 %) were categorized as definitive, or uncertain for, less than 9 months of age between 2007 and 2011. Retapamulin prescription events in children aged less than 9 months were relatively low compared with other recent estimations of off-label pediatric medicines. Our report provides a framework for future investigations and discussions that may facilitate off-label reporting schemes and promote pediatric drug safety.

Invasive infections due to <i>Staphylococcus aureus</i>, including methicillin-resistant <i>S. aureus</i> are prevalent and life-threatening. Combinations of antibiotic therapy have been employed in many clinical settings for improving therapeutic efficacy, reducing side effects of drugs, and development of antibiotic resistance. Pleuromutilins have a potential to be developed as a new class of antibiotics for systemic use in humans. In the current study, we investigated the relationship between pleuromutilins, including valnemulin, tiamulin, and retapamulin, and 13 other antibiotics representing different mechanisms of action, against methicillin-susceptible and -resistant <i>S. aureus</i> both <i>in vitro</i> and in an experimental <i>Galleria mellonella</i> model. <i>In vitro</i> synergistic effects were observed in combination of all three study pleuromutilins with tetracycline (TET) by standard checkerboard and/or time-kill assays. In addition, the combination of pleuromutilins with ciprofloxacin or enrofloxacin showed antagonistic effects, while the rest combinations presented indifferent effects. Importantly, all study pleuromutilins in combination with TET significantly enhanced survival rates as compared to the single drug treatment in the <i>G. mellonella</i> model caused by <i>S. aureus</i> strains. Taken together, these results demonstrated synergy effects between pleuromutilins and TET against <i>S. aureus</i> both <i>in vitro</i> and <i>in vivo</i>.

Patients with atopic dermatitis (AD) are known to have a predisposition to colonization or infection by microbial organisms, including both Staphylococcus aureus and herpes simplex virus (HSV). S aureus infection leads to exacerbation of eczema and may induce flares in atopic skin by mediating inflammation. Retapamulin 1% ointment is a unique topical antibiotic formulation that may be a suitable option for the treatment of clinically infected AD. A single-center, open-label pilot study was conducted to investigate the efficacy and safety of retapamulin 1% (Altabax, Stiefel/ GlaxoSmithKline) ointment for the treatment of secondarily infected atopic dermatitis in subjects aged 9 months to 98 years old (n=29). Twice-daily application of retapamulin 1% produced a mean 8.1-point reduction from baseline in the mean Skin Infection Rating Scale score. The majority of subjects achieved clinical cure with topical retapamulin therapy. Retapamulin 1% ointment was effective against S aureus isolates, including methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA). Treatment was well tolerated. Retapamulin 1% is effective for the treatment of atopic dermatitis infected with S aureus, and demonstrates efficacy against both methicillin-susceptible and methicillin-resistant strains. Given its efficacy and good tolerability in this pilot study, retapamulin 1% ointment should be further evaluated as a treatment for infected atopic dermatitis. It may provide convenience and efficacy with a low risk for development of bacterial resistance.

Impetigo is a common childhood skin infection. There are reports of increasing drug resistance to the currently used topical antibiotics including fusidic acid and mupirocin. Retapamulin is a newer topical agent of pleuromutilin class approved by the Food and Drug Administration for treatment of impetigo in children and has been recently made available in the Indian market. It has been demonstrated to have low potential for the development of antibacterial resistance and a high degree of potency against poly drug resistant Gram-positive bacteria found in skin infections including Staphylococcus aureus strains. The drug is safe owing to low systemic absorption and has only minimal side-effect of local irritation at the site of application.

Meticillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) is a rapidly spreading pathogen associated predominantly with skin infections. The lack of clinical evidence indicating the best treatment strategy to combat MRSA skin infections prompted us to investigate the efficacy of available treatment options in an experimental skin wound infection model in mice. Mice were treated either topically with retapamulin (1%), fusidic acid (2%) or mupirocin (2%) or systemically with linezolid (50-100 mg/kg/day) or vancomycin (50-200 mg/kg/day) twice daily for 3 days or 6 days and the total bacterial loads in the skin lesions were determined. Retapamulin, fusidic acid and mupirocin treatment for 3 days reduced the bacterial loads by 2.5, 2.9 and 2.0 log(10) CFU, respectively, and treatment for 6 days by 5.0, 4.2 and 5.1 log(10) CFU, respectively, compared with non-treated controls (P < 0.001). Systemic treatment with linezolid for 6 days reduced the bacterial loads by 1.6 log(10) CFU compared with non-treated mice (P < 0.001), whereas vancomycin treatment showed no effect on reducing the bacterial loads in infected skin lesions. These findings suggest that topical treatment with retapamulin and mupirocin is significantly more effective than systemic treatment with linezolid and vancomycin in eradicating MRSA in skin wounds. Retapamulin and mupirocin may provide an alternative to fusidic acid treatment of MRSA in skin wounds when resistance to fusidic acid is suspected.

To evaluate the clinical and bacteriological efficacy of topical retapamulin ointment 1% versus oral linezolid in the treatment of patients with secondarily infected traumatic lesions (SITLs; excluding abscesses) or impetigo due to methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA). A randomized, double-blind, double-dummy, multicenter, comparative study (NCT00852540). Patients recruited from 36 study centers in the United States. Patients 2 months or older with SITL (including secondarily infected lacerations or sutured wounds) or impetigo (bullous and nonbullous) suitable for treatment with a topical antibiotic, with a total Skin Infection Rating Scale score of 8 or greater, including a pus/exudate score of 3 or greater. Patients received retapamulin ointment 1% (plus oral placebo), twice daily for 5 days or oral linezolid (plus placebo ointment) 2 or 3 times daily for 10 days. Primary end point: clinical response (success/failure) at follow-up in patients with MRSA at baseline (per-protocol population). Secondary efficacy end points: clinical and microbiologic response and outcome at follow-up and end of therapy; therapeutic response at follow-up. The majority of patients had SITL (70.4% [188/267] and 66.4% [91/137] in the retapamulin and linezolid groups, respectively; intent-to-treat clinical population). Clinical success rate at follow-up was significantly lower in the retapamulin versus the linezolid group (63.9% [39/61] vs 90.6% [29/32], respectively; difference in success rate -26.7%; 95% CI, -45.7 to -7.7). Clinical success rate at follow-up in the per-protocol MRSA population was significantly lower in the retapamulin versus the linezolid group. It could not be determined whether this was related to study design, bacterial virulence, or retapamulin activity.

Retapamulin is a semisynthetic pleuromutilin compound with in vitroactivity against Gram-positive bacteria, no cross-resistance to other classes of antimicrobial agents in current use and a low potential for development of resistance. A 1% ointment formulation has been developed for clinical use, and a placebo-controlled trial of impetigo in 210 patients produced significantly higher rates of clinical and microbiological success compared with placebo - 85.6 versus 52.1% and 91.2 versus 50.9%, respectively. Additional comparative studies in over 1900 patients showed noninferiority to topical fusidic acid and oral cephalexin and a low frequency of adverse events. In 2007, retapamulin was approved in the USA for topical treatment of impetigo caused by Streptococcus pyogenes and methicillin-susceptible Staphylococcus aureus, and in the EU for topical treatment of impetigo and infected wounds caused by S. pyogenes and S. aureus, with approvals including adults and children over 9 months of age.

Staphylococcus aureus (S. aureus) is the leading cause of nosocomial infections and responsible for more than 11 million skin and soft tissue infections annually. Impetigo is a common skin infection and the most common bacterial skin infection in children aged two to five years. The emergence of S. aureus isolates resistant to commonly utilized antibacterials for skin infections (beta-lactams, erythromycin, fluoroquinolones and mupirocin) makes successful treatment an ongoing challenge. To treat skin infections such as impetigo, antibacterials with a short dosing schedule and low propensity to develop resistance should be used. In 2007, retapamulin was the first agent for human use approved in the pleuromutilin class of antibacterials in the United States (U.S.), and is the first topical antibacterial indicated to treat impetigo in over 20 years. In vitro, retapamulin is highly potent against S. aureus and has a lower propensity to develop resistance than mupirocin. In clinical studies, the convenient five-day b.i.d. (twice-daily) dosing of retapamulin is highly effective against impetigo due to methicillin- susceptible S. aureus and Streptococcus pyogenes and may play an important role in limiting the development of resistance against systemic agents.

Staphylococcus aureus skin infections represent a significant public health threat because of the emergence of antibiotic-resistant strains such as methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA). As greater understanding of protective immune responses and more effective antimicrobial therapies are needed, a S. aureus skin wound infection model was developed in which full-thickness scalpel cuts on the backs of mice were infected with a bioluminescent S. aureus (methicillin sensitive) or USA300 community-acquired MRSA strain and in vivo imaging was used to noninvasively monitor the bacterial burden. In addition, the infection-induced inflammatory response was quantified using in vivo fluorescence imaging of LysEGFP mice. Using this model, we found that both IL-1α and IL-1β contributed to host defense during a wound infection, whereas IL-1β was more critical during an intradermal S. aureus infection. Furthermore, treatment of a USA300 MRSA skin infection with retapamulin ointment resulted in up to 85-fold reduction in bacterial burden and a 53% decrease in infection-induced inflammation. In contrast, mupirocin ointment had minimal clinical activity against this USA300 strain, resulting in only a 2-fold reduction in bacterial burden. Taken together, this S. aureus wound infection model provides a valuable preclinical screening method to investigate cutaneous immune responses and the efficacy of topical antimicrobial therapies.

Impetigo is the most common bacterial skin infection in children two to five years of age. There are two principal types: nonbullous (70% of cases) and bullous (30% of cases). Nonbullous impetigo, or impetigo contagiosa, is caused by Staphylococcus aureus or Streptococcus pyogenes, and is characterized by honey-colored crusts on the face and extremities. Impetigo primarily affects the skin or secondarily infects insect bites, eczema, or herpetic lesions. Bullous impetigo, which is caused exclusively by S. aureus, results in large, flaccid bullae and is more likely to affect intertriginous areas. Both types usually resolve within two to three weeks without scarring, and complications are rare, with the most serious being poststreptococcal glomerulonephritis. Treatment includes topical antibiotics such as mupirocin, retapamulin, and fusidic acid. Oral antibiotic therapy can be used for impetigo with large bullae or when topical therapy is impractical. Amoxicillin/clavulanate, dicloxacillin, cephalexin, clindamycin, doxycycline, minocycline, trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole, and macrolides are options, but penicillin is not. Natural therapies such as tea tree oil; olive, garlic, and coconut oils; and Manuka honey have been anecdotally successful, but lack sufficient evidence to recommend or dismiss them as treatment options. Treatments under development include minocycline foam and Ozenoxacin, a topical quinolone. Topical disinfectants are inferior to antibiotics and should not be used. Empiric treatment considerations have changed with the increasing prevalence of antibiotic-resistant bacteria, with methicillin-resistant S. aureus, macrolide-resistant streptococcus, and mupirocin-resistant streptococcus all documented. Fusidic acid, mupirocin, and retapamulin cover methicillin-susceptible S. aureus and streptococcal infections. Clindamycin proves helpful in suspected methicillin-resistant S. aureus infections. Trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole covers methicillin-resistant S. aureus infection, but is inadequate for streptococcal infection.

Retapamulin is the first agent in the new pleuromutilin class of antibacterials to become commercially available for clinical use in humans. Retapamulin acts as a potent inhibitor of bacterial protein synthesis and has a unique mode of antibiotic action. To date, retapamulin has not demonstrated any clinically relevant, target-specific crossresistance with other antibiotic classes, and has shown a low potential for resistance selection in vitro. In preclinical studies, retapamulin demonstrated pronounced in vitro activity against staphylococcal, streptococcal and anaerobic Gram-positive clinical isolates associated with skin and skin structure infections. Clinical pharmacology studies showed low systemic exposure with topical use of retapamulin, and a favorable tolerability profile. In clinical efficacy trials involving pediatric and adult patients who received retapamulin twice daily for five days, retapamulin was highly effective in the treatment of impetigo, secondarily infected traumatic lesions and secondarily infected dermatitis. Further, the clinical efficacy and safety profile of retapamulin was comparable to that of commonly used oral and topical antibiotics. Retapamulin was also clinically effective against isolates resistant to existing therapies. As a 1% ointment, retapamulin has been approved in the United States for the treatment of impetigo and in Europe for the shortterm treatment of impetigo and infected small lacerations, abrasions and sutured wounds.

Retapamulin is a semisynthetic pleuromutilin derivative being developed as a topical antibiotic for treating bacterial infections of the skin. It is potent in vitro against susceptible and multidrug-resistant organisms commonly associated with bacterial skin infections. We report detailed mode of action studies demonstrating that retapamulin binds to the bacterial ribosome with high affinity, inhibits ribosomal peptidyl transferase activity, and partially inhibits the binding of the initiator tRNA substrate to the ribosomal P-site. Taken together, these data distinguish the mode of action of retapamulin from that of other classes of antibiotics. This unique mode of action may explain the lack of clinically relevant, target-specific cross-resistance of retapamulin with antibacterials in current use.

Impetigo is a common skin infection, primarily caused by Staphylococcus aureus and mainly occurring in children. It is usually treated topically with antibiotics to achieve a quick cure and prevent spread of the infection. Worldwide, resistance rates of S. aureus against commonly used antibiotics are rising. Retapamulin belongs to a newly developed class of antibiotics for the treatment of uncomplicated skin infections. Our aim was to compare the efficacy and safety of topical application of retapamulin ointment with topical placebo ointment in the treatment of primary impetigo. In a randomized, double-blind, multicentre study, patients received either topical retapamulin ointment 1% twice daily for 5 days or topical placebo. Patients were enrolled into the study for 14 days and attended the clinic for three visits during which clinical and laboratory evaluations were performed. Two hundred and thirteen patients were randomized, with 139 evaluable patients in the retapamulin group and 71 in the placebo group. Based on the primary efficacy endpoint of clinical response after 7 days (intention to treat), retapamulin ointment was superior to placebo (success rate 85.6% vs. 52.1%; P<0.0001). Similar results were found in the per protocol analysis and in the subgroup of patients who had a pathogen isolated at baseline. The most common adverse effect, pruritus at the application site, was reported by 6% and 1% of patients in the retapamulin and placebo groups, respectively. This study shows that topical retapamulin is effective and safe in the treatment of primary impetigo, offering a new treatment option.

Retapamulin is the first agent of the pleuromutilin class formulated as a topical antibacterial for treating skin infections. The aim of this study was to determine the antimicrobial activity of retapamulin by determining the minimal inhibitory concentration (MIC) values of this new drug and comparators against a wide range of anaerobic bacteria of human origin. The in vitro activity of retapamulin and six comparators (amoxicillin, amoxicillin/clavulanic acid, ceftriaxone, imipenem, clindamycin and metronidazole) was evaluated against 232 anaerobic clinical isolates. MICs were determined by the CLSI reference agar dilution method (M11-A6). Ceftriaxone, clindamycin and amoxicillin/clavulanic acid resistance rates were 54%, 42% and 9.6%, respectively, within the Bacteroides fragilis group. Despite high resistance rates to various antibiotics, retapamulin inhibited 37/52 (71%) strains of the B. fragilis group and 85/87 (98%) of the other Gram-negative bacilli at a concentration of 2 mg/L or less. All the investigated strains of Clostridium perfringens were inhibited by 1 mg/L retapamulin. Three strains of C. difficile and one strain of C. clostridioforme demonstrated decreased susceptibility to retapamulin. Based on inhibitory concentrations, retapamulin was more active than clindamycin, metronidazole and ceftriaxone against Propionibacterium acnes and anaerobic Gram-positive cocci, as all isolates were inhibited by <or=2 mg/L. At <or=2 mg/L, retapamulin inhibited 90% of all 232 anaerobes tested, whereas overall resistance rates for the comparators were as follows: co-amoxiclav, 2%; metronidazole, 12%; clindamycin, 15% and ceftriaxone, 20%. The broad anaerobic spectrum demonstrated by retapamulin in vitro is attractive. Pending further clinical investigation, retapamulin may offer an alternative treatment for anaerobic skin infections in this era of increasing resistance.
