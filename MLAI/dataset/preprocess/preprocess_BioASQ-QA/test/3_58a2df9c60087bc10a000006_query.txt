What is the incidence of beta-thalassemia in Greek population?

[PMID: 1620378]
A program for the detection of thalassemias and other hemoglobinopathies in high-risk populations is described. This program, based on two screening tests, was applied to the Hellenic Army recruits and was found to work well. Red cell one-point osmotic fragility was used for the detection of thalassemic samples and hemoglobin electrophoresis for screening of other hemoglobinopathies. Samples with decreased red cell osmotic fragility and/or abnormal electrophoretic pattern were submitted for further detailed investigation. Following this program, 64,814 recruits, representing 0.651% of the total Greek population and 9.917% of the 20-year-old Greek male population, were tested. beta-Thalassemia was found with an average incidence of 5.476% and alpha-Thalassemia with an incidence of 0.201%. Hemoglobinopathy Lepore was detected in 51 samples (0.079%) and hemoglobinopathy-S in 352 samples (0.543%).

Hemoglobinopathies are very common in Greece, the incidence of beta-thalassemia trait being 8% and that of sickle cell trait ranging from 1 to 32% in various districts. In Greek populations, sickle cell disease (SCD) is mainly represented by S-beta thalassemia.

The frequency of beta-thalassaemia trait was estimated in 209 consecutive patients hospitalized for acute myocardial infarction in order to answer the question of the possible protective effect of heterozygosity for beta-thalassaemia on the incidence of the disease. 212 patients hospitalized during the same period for various accidental bone fractures served as controls. Diagnosis of both, acute myocardial infarction and beta-thalassaemia trait, was based on the standard clinical and laboratory criteria. We found that patients with acute myocardial infarction had low frequency of beta-thalassaemia trait (4.31%), as compared with the mean incidence of heterozygosity for beta-thalassaemia in the whole Greek population (7.61%) (p < 0.02). This finding was more clear in the older age groups of the patients studied. No statistically significant differences were found in the frequency of beta-thalassaemia trait between control subjects (8.49%) and the whole Greek population. We concluded that the heterozygosity for beta-thalassaemia may protect the carrier from acute myocardial infarction. This effect is probably related to low serum cholesterol levels, slight anaemia, and microcytosis lowering the blood viscosity. These changes are usually present in the beta-thalassaemia trait carriers.
