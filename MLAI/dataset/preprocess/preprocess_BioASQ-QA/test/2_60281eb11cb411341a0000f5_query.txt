Aging is associated with reductions in hippocampal volume that are accelerated by Alzheimer's disease and vascular risk factors. Our genome-wide association study (GWAS) of dementia-free persons (n = 9,232) identified 46 SNPs at four loci with P values of <4.0 × 10(-7). In two additional samples (n = 2,318), associations were replicated at 12q14 within MSRB3-WIF1 (discovery and replication; rs17178006; P = 5.3 × 10(-11)) and at 12q24 near HRK-FBXW8 (rs7294919; P = 2.9 × 10(-11)). Remaining associations included one SNP at 2q24 within DPP4 (rs6741949; P = 2.9 × 10(-7)) and nine SNPs at 9p33 within ASTN2 (rs7852872; P = 1.0 × 10(-7)); along with the chromosome 12 associations, these loci were also associated with hippocampal volume (P < 0.05) in a third younger, more heterogeneous sample (n = 7,794). The SNP in ASTN2 also showed suggestive association with decline in cognition in a largely independent sample (n = 1,563). These associations implicate genes related to apoptosis (HRK), development (WIF1), oxidative stress (MSR3B), ubiquitination (FBXW8) and neuronal migration (ASTN2), as well as enzymes targeted by new diabetes medications (DPP4), indicating new genetic influences on hippocampal size and possibly the risk of cognitive decline and dementia.

Recently, two large genome-wide association studies (GWASs) have identified several variants at 12q14 and 12q24 which are associated with hippocampal volume, one of the most important biological markers of Alzheimer's disease (AD). The strongest association was reported for the rs7294919 polymorphism on chromosome 12q24.22. In order to explore whether rs7294919 polymorphism was also associated with late-onset AD (LOAD) risk, we recruited 1132 LOAD patients and 1159 sex- and age-matched healthy controls in the study. The results showed that rs7294919 polymorphism was significantly associated with LOAD (genotype P<0.01, allele P=0.02). After stratification by APOE, significant difference was only observed in non-APOE ɛ4 carriers (P=0.01). Logistic regression demonstrated that the C allele at rs7294919 was a risk factor for LOAD in dominant and recessive models after adjusting for age, gender and the APOE ɛ4 carrier status. In conclusion, our study demonstrates an association of rs7294919 polymorphism locus on chromosome 12q24.22 with risk for LOAD in Han Chinese.
