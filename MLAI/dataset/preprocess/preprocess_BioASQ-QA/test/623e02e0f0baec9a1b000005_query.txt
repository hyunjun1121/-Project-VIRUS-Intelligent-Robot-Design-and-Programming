What is the KDEL retention signal?

We investigated the suitability of transformed rice cell lines as a system for the production of therapeutic recombinant antibodies. Expression constructs encoding a single-chain Fv fragment (scFvT84.66, specific for CEA, the carcinoembryonic antigen present on many human tumours) were introduced into rice tissue by particle bombardment. We compared antibody production levels when antibodies were either secreted to the apoplast or retained in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) using a KDEL retention signal. Production levels were up to 14 times higher when antibodies were retained in the ER. Additionally, we compared construct sencoding different leader peptides (plant codon optimised murine immunoglobulin heavy and light chain leader peptides from mAb24) and carrying alternative 5' untranslated regions (the petunia chalcone synthase gene 5' UTR and the tobacco mosaic virus omega sequence). We observed no significant differences in antibody production levels among cell lines transformed with these constructs. The highest level of antibody production we measured was 3.8 micrograms g-1 callus (fresh weight). Immunological analysis of transgenic rice callus confirmed the presence of functional scFvT84.66. We discuss the potential merits of cell culture for the production of recombinant antibodies and other valuable macromolecules.

Prostaglandin endoperoxide H (PGH) synthases 1 and 2 are both membrane-associated proteins localized to the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and nuclear envelope. The carboxyl terminal tetrapeptides of PGH synthases 1 and 2 are of the form -P/STEL. These sequences are similar to the -KDEL retention signal sequence characteristic of many proteins localized to the ER. To determine if the -PTEL sequence (residues 597-600) functions as an ER retention signal for ovine PGH synthase-1, we prepared and analyzed five mutants (L600N, L600R, L600V, E599Q, and delta 597), all having modifications that would be expected to alter the subcellular location of PGH synthase-1 if the -PTEL sequence were involved in ER targeting. Native ovine PGH synthase-1 and each of the five mutants were subcloned into the pSVT7 expression vector and were expressed transiently in cos-1 cells. The L600N, L600R, E599Q, and delta 597 mutants retained both cyclooxygenase and peroxidase activities. Moreover, when subjected to immunocytofluorescent staining, cos-1 cells expressing native and mutant enzymes showed similar patterns of fluorescence corresponding to ER and nuclear envelope localization. Finally, culture media bathing cos-1 cells transfected with native or mutant PGH synthases were tested for secreted PGH synthase-1 protein by Western blotting, but no PGH synthase-1 was detected in any of the culture media. Our results demonstrate that mutations in the C-terminal sequence-PTEL do not change the subcellular location of ovine PGH synthase-1. Thus, targeting of PGH synthase-1 to the ER can occur independent of its -PTEL sequence.

Prion disease is a fatal neurodegenerative disease that may result from the conversion of normal cellular prion protein (PrP<sup>C</sup>) to the pathogenic scrapie PrP isoform (PrP<sup>Sc</sup>), however, how proliferation of prion leads to neuronal apoptosis is still not clear. In this study, to explore the role of the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) in prion diseases, we engineered the KDEL ER-retention motif to the C-terminus of PrP<sup>C</sup> and studied its effect on N2A cell toxicity. The KDEL retention signal led to the accumulation of PrP in the ER, and KDEL signal could effectively deplete PrP from the cell surface and trap PrP in the ER/Cis-Golgi compartment. PrP<sup>C</sup> molecules were delayed in their transit along the early pathway of the secretory compartment, however, they did not aggregate, and were not resistant to Proteinase K (PK) or become detergent-insoluble. Moreover, we found that the ER was not the site where PrP became detergent-insoluble and acquired PK resistance. In addition, an MTT assay indicated cells expressing PrP<sup>C</sup>/N2A were sensitive to proteasome inhibition, but not N2A cells expressing PrP<sup>KDEL</sup>. Our findings suggest that the ER is not a compartment in which wild type PrP<sup>C</sup> is able to initiate aggregation, protease resistance or other scapie-like properties of PrP.

Directing an antigen to the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) improves the antigen-specific immune response, revealing a potentially useful strategy in cancer immunotherapy using tumor-associated antigens (TAAs). This can be achieved by fusing the antigen to an ER chaperone protein, such as calreticulin (CRT). We previously reported the antitumor response by fusing the CRT signal peptide (SP) and its ER retention sequence (KDEL) to full-length human papillomavirus type 16 (HPV-16) E6 and E7 antigens, obtaining a potent antitumoral effect. In this article, we compare the antitumor response due to the use of each signal (SP and/or KDEL) fused to HPV16 E6 and E7 antigens in a DNA vaccination model. Using both SP and KDEL signals promotes higher interferon (IFN)-γ production and a faster antitumor response than using only the SP, resulting in better tumor growth restraint and higher survival, indicating that the KDEL addition to an ER-directed antigen helps by shortening the time to response. Meanwhile, antigens without signals or only the KDEL signal showed no induction of antigen-specific IFN-γ or antitumor response. Our results indicate that directing the E6E7m antigen to the ER by the SP signal is sufficient to promote an efficient antitumor response. Importantly, this effect is stronger and faster when the antigen also has an ER retention sequence, such as the KDEL signal.

Despite the significant advances of antibodies as therapeutic agents, there is still much room for improvement concerning the discovery of these macromolecules. Here, we present a new synthetic cell-based strategy that takes advantage of eukaryotic cell biology to produce highly diverse antibody libraries and, simultaneously, link them to a high-throughput selection mechanism, replicating B cell diversification mechanisms. The interference of site-specific recognition by CRISPR/Cas9 with error-prone DNA repair mechanisms was explored for the generation of diversity, in a cell population containing a gene for a light chain antibody fragment. We achieved up to 93% of cells containing a mutated antibody gene after diversification mechanisms, specifically inside one of the antigen-binding sites. This targeted variability strategy was then integrated into an intracellular selection mechanism. By fusing the antibody with a KDEL retention signal, the interaction of antibodies and native membrane antigens occurs inside the endoplasmic reticulum during the process of protein secretion, enabling the detection of high-quality leads for expression and affinity by flow cytometry. We successfully obtained antibody lead candidates against CD3 as proof of concept. In summary, we developed a novel antibody discovery platform against native antigens by endoplasmic synthetic library generation using CRISPR/Cas9, which will contribute to a faster discovery of new biotherapeutic molecules, reducing the time-to-market.
