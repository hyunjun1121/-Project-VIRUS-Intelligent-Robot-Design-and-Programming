What is Telangiectasia?

[PMID: 22810475]
Juvenile polyposis syndrome is a dominant GI polyposis syndrome defined by ≥ 5 GI juvenile polyps or ≥ 1 juvenile polyps with a family history of juvenile polyposis. Mutations in BMPR1A or SMAD4 are found in 50% of individuals. Hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia is a dominant disorder characterized by epistaxis, visceral arteriovenous malformations, and telangiectasias. Hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia is diagnosed when ≥ 3 criteria including clinical manifestations or a family history, are present. A juvenile polyposis-hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia overlap syndrome has previously been reported in 22% of patients with juvenile polyposis due to a SMAD4 mutation. Our objective was to determine the prevalence and clinical manifestations of hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia by Curacao criteria in our juvenile polyposis SMAD4 patients. This was a cohort study of juvenile polyposis patients in our inherited colon cancer registries. Hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia manifestations were obtained from medical records, patient contact, and/or prospective hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia screening. The Curacao criteria was used for diagnosis of hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia (≥ 3 criteria diagnostic; 2 criteria suspect of). Prevalence and clinical manifestations of hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia in juvenile polyposis SMAD4 patients. Forty-one juvenile polyposis families were identified. Genetic testing was available for individuals within 18 families. SMAD4 mutations were found in 21 relatives in 9 families. Eighty-one percent of SMAD4 patients had hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia and 14% were suspected of having hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia. Epistaxis and asthma are the most common symptoms in our overlap patients. Symptomatic and subclinical arteriovenous malformations were noted near universally. There was a single, tertiary referral center. Nearly all juvenile polyposis SMAD4 patients have the overlap syndrome. The clinical implications and need for hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia screening are important factors for genetic testing in juvenile polyposis. Health care providers must be cognizant of the juvenile polyposis-hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia overlap syndrome and the implications for management of these patients.

Telangiectasias are prominent small vessels (venules, capillaries or arterioles) that are visible as small red-purple focal lesions in the skin and mucous membranes. They can serve as a cutaneous marker for a number of primary (mostly hereditary) disorders and they can be secondary to other (systemic) diseases. Patients with telangiectasias are seen by general health practitioners, pediatricians, (pediatric) neurologists, dermatologists, and ophthalmologists. In this article we give an overview of the different disorders in which telangiectasias are a prominent feature, focusing on neurocutaneous disorders in which they serve as a marker for establishing the right diagnosis. The pattern of distribution of the telangiectasias, their age of onset and associated features are helpful to distinguish between the different disorders.

Neonatal lupus erythematosus (NLE) is an uncommon condition usually associated with maternal anti-Ro autoantibodies. The cutaneous lesions of NLE are usually transient, disappearing about six months after birth, but telangiectasia is a rare complication of NLE which persists. Telangiectasias are small focal red macules and papules created by abnormally prominent capillaries, venules, and arterioles and are a characteristic marker of connective tissue diseases. We report the case of an infant diagnosed with NLE presenting typical annular lesions, positive ANA and positive anti-Ro antibodies. By five months of age, both ANA and anti-Ro antibodies were negative and the annular cutaneous lesions had gradually faded, but small scattered focal red macules appeared on the face, especially in the peri-orbital area and scalp. The cutaneous lupus disappeared but the telangiectasia persisted. We would like to suggest that the diagnosis of NLE should be considered when cutaneous telangiectasias are observed in infants.

Scleroderma (progressive systemic sclerosis) is a systemic autoimmune disorder characterised by skin sclerosis, calcinosis and changes in microvasculature. The etiology of the disease is unknown but both genetic and environmental factors have been implicated. Telangiectasia (macroscopically visible dilated skin vessels) occurring primarily on the hands and face, are a prominent feature in scleroderma and are present in the majority of patients. Similarly, telangiectasia are found in patients with hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia (HHT), a mutational disorder of the germline genes endoglin and ALK-1, members of the TGFbeta receptor family, expressed on endothelial cells. Our study investigated the number, distribution and microscopic characteristics of telangiectasia in both limited (n = 29) and diffuse scleroderma (n = 9) and compared findings with 3 patients with HHT. In limited scleroderma, the mean number of telangiectasia (hand and face) was 36 (0-150) compared with 23 (0-135) in diffuse scieroderma. A significant correlation was observed between the number of telangiectasia on the face and on the hands (p = 0.014). The total number of telangiectasia correlated significantly with the disease duration (p = 0.009). The spatial distribution of the telangiectasia appeared to be random on both hands and foreface in contrast with the distribution of subcutaneous calcification of the hands which occurred predominantly on the distal and flexor surfaces of the first, second and fifth digits. Nailfold microscopic capillaroscopy was performed on 12 patients. No significant correlation was observed between capillary diameter or density and with total number of telangiectasia observed macroscopically. The distribution and microscopic appearance of telangiectasia in scleroderma appeared very similar to those observed in HHT. In view of these similarities we therefore conclude that telangiectactic development in scleroderma may be associated with disorders of the TGFb receptor family proteins found on the microvasculature.
