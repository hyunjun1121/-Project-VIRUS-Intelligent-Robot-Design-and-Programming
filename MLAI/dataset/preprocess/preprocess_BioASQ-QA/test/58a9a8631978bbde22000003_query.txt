Which is the enzymatic activity of OTULIN?

[PMID: 24726323]
The linear ubiquitin (Ub) chain assembly complex (LUBAC) generates Met1-linked "linear" Ub chains that regulate the activation of the nuclear factor κB (NFκB) transcription factor and other processes. We recently discovered OTULIN as a deubiquitinase that specifically cleaves Met1-linked polyUb. Now, we show that OTULIN binds via a conserved PUB-interacting motif (PIM) to the PUB domain of the LUBAC component HOIP. Crystal structures and nuclear magnetic resonance experiments reveal the molecular basis for the high-affinity interaction and explain why OTULIN binds the HOIP PUB domain specifically. Analysis of LUBAC-induced NFκB signaling suggests that OTULIN needs to be present on LUBAC in order to restrict Met1-polyUb signaling. Moreover, LUBAC-OTULIN complex formation is regulated by OTULIN phosphorylation in the PIM. Phosphorylation of OTULIN prevents HOIP binding, whereas unphosphorylated OTULIN is part of the endogenous LUBAC complex. Our work exemplifies how coordination of ubiquitin assembly and disassembly activities in protein complexes regulates individual Ub linkage types.

The linear ubiquitin (Ub) chain assembly complex (LUBAC) is an E3 ligase that specifically assembles Met1-linked (also known as linear) Ub chains that regulate nuclear factor κB (NF-κB) signaling. Deubiquitinases (DUBs) are key regulators of Ub signaling, but a dedicated DUB for Met1 linkages has not been identified. Here, we reveal a previously unannotated human DUB, OTULIN (also known as FAM105B), which is exquisitely specific for Met1 linkages. Crystal structures of the OTULIN catalytic domain in complex with diubiquitin reveal Met1-specific Ub-binding sites and a mechanism of substrate-assisted catalysis in which the proximal Ub activates the catalytic triad of the protease. Mutation of Ub Glu16 inhibits OTULIN activity by reducing kcat 240-fold. OTULIN overexpression or knockdown affects NF-κB responses to LUBAC, TNFα, and poly(I:C) and sensitizes cells to TNFα-induced cell death. We show that OTULIN binds LUBAC and that overexpression of OTULIN prevents TNFα-induced NEMO association with ubiquitinated RIPK1. Our data suggest that OTULIN regulates Met1-polyUb signaling.

Modification of proteins with Met1-linked 'linear' ubiquitin chains has emerged as a key regulatory signal to control inflammatory signalling via the master regulator, the transcription factor nuclear factor κB (NF-κB). While the assembly machinery, the linear ubiquitin chain assembly complex (LUBAC), and receptors for this ubiquitin chain type have been known for years, it was less clear which deubiquitinating enzymes (DUBs) hydrolyse Met1 linkages specifically. In 2013, two labs reported the previously unannotated protein FAM105B/OTULIN to be this missing Met1 linkage-specific DUB. Structural studies have revealed how OTULIN achieves its remarkable specificity, employing a mechanism of ubiquitin-assisted catalysis in which a glutamate residue on the substrate complements the active site of the enzyme. The specificity of OTULIN enables it to regulate global levels of Met1-linked polyubiquitin in cells. This ability led to investigations of NF-κB activation from new angles, and also revealed involvement of Met1-polyubiquitin in Wnt signalling. Interestingly, OTULIN directly interacts with LUBAC, and this interaction is dynamic and can be regulated by OTULIN phosphorylation. This provides a new paradigm for how individual linkage types can be regulated by dedicated enzyme complexes mediating assembly and removal. Here we review what has been learned about OTULIN's mechanism, regulation and function, discuss the open questions in the field, and discuss how DUBs regulate the NF-κB response.

Conjugation of Met1-linked polyubiquitin (Met1-Ub) by the linear ubiquitin chain assembly complex (LUBAC) is an important regulatory modification in innate immune signaling. So far, only few Met1-Ub substrates have been described, and the regulatory mechanisms have remained elusive. We recently identified that the ovarian tumor (OTU) family deubiquitinase OTULIN specifically disassembles Met1-Ub. Here, we report that OTULIN is critical for limiting Met1-Ub accumulation after nucleotide-oligomerization domain-containing protein 2 (NOD2) stimulation, and that OTULIN depletion augments signaling downstream of NOD2. Affinity purification of Met1-Ub followed by quantitative proteomics uncovered RIPK2 as the predominant NOD2-regulated substrate. Accordingly, Met1-Ub on RIPK2 was largely inhibited by overexpressing OTULIN and was increased by OTULIN depletion. Intriguingly, OTULIN-depleted cells spontaneously accumulated Met1-Ub on LUBAC components, and NOD2 or TNFR1 stimulation led to extensive Met1-Ub accumulation on receptor complex components. We propose that OTULIN restricts Met1-Ub formation after immune receptor stimulation to prevent unwarranted proinflammatory signaling.

Protein ubiquitination, a major post-translational modification in eukaryotes, requires an adequate pool of free ubiquitin. Cells maintain this pool by two pathways, both involving deubiquitinases (DUBs): recycling of ubiquitin from ubiquitin conjugates and processing of ubiquitin precursors synthesized de novo. Although many advances have been made in recent years regarding ubiquitin recycling, our knowledge on ubiquitin precursor processing is still limited, and questions such as when are these precursors processed and which DUBs are involved remain largely unanswered. Here we provide data suggesting that two of the four mammalian ubiquitin precursors, UBA52 and UBA80, are processed mostly post-translationally whereas the other two, UBB and UBC, probably undergo a combination of co- and post-translational processing. Using an unbiased biochemical approach we found that UCHL3, USP9X, USP7, USP5 and Otulin/Gumby/FAM105b are by far the most active DUBs acting on these precursors. The identification of these DUBs together with their properties suggests that each ubiquitin precursor can be processed in at least two different manners, explaining the robustness of the ubiquitin de novo synthesis pathway.

Linear ubiquitination is a post-translational protein modification recently discovered to be crucial for innate and adaptive immune signaling. The function of linear ubiquitin chains is regulated at multiple levels: generation, recognition, and removal. These chains are generated by the linear ubiquitin chain assembly complex (LUBAC), the only known ubiquitin E3 capable of forming the linear ubiquitin linkage de novo. LUBAC is not only relevant for activation of nuclear factor-κB (NF-κB) and mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPKs) in various signaling pathways, but importantly, it also regulates cell death downstream of immune receptors capable of inducing this response. Recognition of the linear ubiquitin linkage is specifically mediated by certain ubiquitin receptors, which is crucial for translation into the intended signaling outputs. LUBAC deficiency results in attenuated gene activation and increased cell death, causing pathologic conditions in both, mice, and humans. Removal of ubiquitin chains is mediated by deubiquitinases (DUBs). Two of them, OTULIN and CYLD, are constitutively associated with LUBAC. Here, we review the current knowledge on linear ubiquitination in immune signaling pathways and the biochemical mechanisms as to how linear polyubiquitin exerts its functions distinctly from those of other ubiquitin linkage types.

Linear ubiquitin chains are implicated in the regulation of the NF-κB pathway, immunity, and inflammation. They are synthesized by the LUBAC complex containing the catalytic subunit HOIL-1-interacting protein (HOIP) and are disassembled by the linear ubiquitin-specific deubiquitinase OTULIN. Little is known about the regulation of these opposing activities. Here we demonstrate that HOIP and OTULIN interact and act as a bimolecular editing pair for linear ubiquitin signals in vivo. The HOIP PUB domain binds to the PUB interacting motif (PIM) of OTULIN and the chaperone VCP/p97. Structural studies revealed the basis of high-affinity interaction with the OTULIN PIM. The conserved Tyr56 of OTULIN makes critical contacts with the HOIP PUB domain, and its phosphorylation negatively regulates this interaction. Functionally, HOIP binding to OTULIN is required for the recruitment of OTULIN to the TNF receptor complex and to counteract HOIP-dependent activation of the NF-κB pathway.

Linear ubiquitin chains generated by the linear ubiquitin chain assembly complex (LUBAC) play an important role in NF-κB activation. However, the regulation of linear ubiquitin chain generation by LUBAC is not well characterized. Here, we identified two deubiquitinating enzymes (DUBs), ovarian tumor DUB with linear linkage specificity (OTULIN/Gumby/FAM105B) and cylindromatosis (CYLD) that can cleave linear polyubiquitin chains and interact with LUBAC via the N-terminal PNGase/UBA or UBX (PUB) domain of HOIP, a catalytic subunit of LUBAC. HOIP interacts with both CYLD and OTULIN even in unstimulated cells. The interaction of CYLD and OTULIN with HOIP synergistically suppresses LUBAC-mediated linear polyubiquitination and NF-κB activation. Moreover, introduction of a HOIP mutant unable to bind either deubiquitinase into HOIP-null cells augments the activation of NF-κB by TNF-α stimulation. Thus, the interactions between these two deubiquitinases and the LUBAC ubiquitin ligase are involved in controlling the extent of TNF-α-induced NF-κB activation in cells by fine-tuning the generation of linear ubiquitin chains by LUBAC. The interaction of HOIP with OTULIN is also involved in OTULIN suppressing the canonical Wnt signaling pathway activation by LUBAC. Our observations provide molecular insights into the roles of ligase-deubiquitinase interactions in regulating molecular events resulting from linear ubiquitin conjugation.

Systemic autoinflammatory diseases are caused by mutations in genes that function in innate immunity. Here, we report an autoinflammatory disease caused by loss-of-function mutations in OTULIN (FAM105B), encoding a deubiquitinase with linear linkage specificity. We identified two missense and one frameshift mutations in one Pakistani and two Turkish families with four affected patients. Patients presented with neonatal-onset fever, neutrophilic dermatitis/panniculitis, and failure to thrive, but without obvious primary immunodeficiency. HEK293 cells transfected with mutated OTULIN had decreased enzyme activity relative to cells transfected with WT OTULIN, and showed a substantial defect in the linear deubiquitination of target molecules. Stimulated patients' fibroblasts and peripheral blood mononuclear cells showed evidence for increased signaling in the canonical NF-κB pathway and accumulated linear ubiquitin aggregates. Levels of proinflammatory cytokines were significantly increased in the supernatants of stimulated primary cells and serum samples. This discovery adds to the emerging spectrum of human diseases caused by defects in the ubiquitin pathway and suggests a role for targeted cytokine therapies.
