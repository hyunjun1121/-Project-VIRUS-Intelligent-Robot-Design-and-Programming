Endurance running places substantial physiological strain on the body, which can develop into chronic inflammation and overuse injuries, negatively affecting subsequent training and performance. A recent study found that dietary polyphenols and methlysulfonylmethane (MSM) can reduce systemic inflammation and oxidative stress without adverse side effects. The purpose was to identify a set of candidate protein and RNA biomarkers that are associated with improved outcomes related to inflammation and muscle injury, when athletes used 3 proprietary supplements both prior to and during early recovery from a half-marathon race. The study was an open-label pilot study. The study was field based, with sample analysis conducted in the Applied Physiology Laboratory in the Department of Kinesiology, Health Promotion and Recreation at the University of North Texas in Denton, Texas. Participants were 15 young, exercise-trained men and women. The intervention group consumed 1000 mg/d of a proprietary 50-50 mix of optimized curcumin and pomegranate extract for 26 days. The group also consumed 500 mg/d of a proprietary MSM for the same period. Three days prior to and one day after a race, the daily dosage was doubled. The control group received no supplements. Venous blood samples were collected at pre-race and at 4h and 24h after running a half-marathon race. The research team evaluated results for target proteins that have been associated with inflammation and muscle injury in the scientific literature. The team also performed an analysis of RNA biomarkers. At the 4h and 24h time points, a significant treatment-response was observed that included increases in proteins: (1) osteonectin/SPARC-osteonectin/secreted protein acidic and rich in cysteine and (2) BDNF-brain-derived neurotrophic factor. At the same points, the study also found increased RNA: (1) PACER-P50-associated COX-2 extragenic RNA, (2) PTGES-prostaglandin E synthase, (3) MYD88-innate immune signal transduction adaptor MYD88, (4) TNFS14-tumor necrosis factor (TNF) superfamily member 14, (5) THRIL-TNF and heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein L (HNRNPL)-related immunoregulatory long noncoding RNA, (6) TRAF6-TNF receptor associated factor 6, (7) CX3CL1-C-X3-C motif chemokine ligand 1, (8) MALAT1-metastasis-associated lung adenocarcinoma transcript 1, and (9) LINC00305-long intergenic nonprotein coding RNA 305. The combination of polyphenol and MSM supplementation resulted in a systemic response that may translate to an accelerated rate of muscle recovery, allowing participants return to exercise and normal activities more quickly. This pilot study is the foundation for a larger investigation in the research team's laboratory.

Methylsulfonylmethane (MSM) has become a popular dietary supplement used for a variety of purposes, including its most common use as an anti-inflammatory agent. It has been well-investigated in animal models, as well as in human clinical trials and experiments. A variety of health-specific outcome measures are improved with MSM supplementation, including inflammation, joint/muscle pain, oxidative stress, and antioxidant capacity. Initial evidence is available regarding the dose of MSM needed to provide benefit, although additional work is underway to determine the precise dose and time course of treatment needed to provide optimal benefits. As a Generally Recognized As Safe (GRAS) approved substance, MSM is well-tolerated by most individuals at dosages of up to four grams daily, with few known and mild side effects. This review provides an overview of MSM, with details regarding its common uses and applications as a dietary supplement, as well as its safety for consumption.

Methylsulfonylmethane (MSM) is a natural organic compound that displays anti-inflammatory as well as antioxidant properties. MSM reportedly has potential in inhibition of tumor cells. However, molecular mechanisms underlying the effects of MSM on lung cancer remain unclear. In this study, the effect of MSM on A549 cells was examined. We focused on the mode of apoptosis induced by MSM and investigated alterations in the integrity of the outer membrane of mitochondria. Our results showed that MSM inhibited viability of A549 cells and changed the shape and permeability of nuclei. In addition, MSM induced G<sub>2</sub>/M arrest. MSM reduced the mitochondrial membrane potential and contributed to release of cytochrome c from mitochondria to cytoplasm. MSM is a potential anticancer agent for the treatment of lung cancer.

Periodontal disease is the most common chronic disease of the oral and maxillofacial region, causing alveolar bone loss and ultimate loss of tooth. The purpose of treatment of periodontal disease is to promote the regeneration of periodontal tissue, including alveolar bone, and implantation of fixtures to replace the missing tooth as a result of advanced periodontal disease also requires alveolar bone regeneration. Methylsulfonylmethane (MSM) is a sulfur compound with well-known anti-inflammatory effects but its effects on bone regeneration are unknown. In this study, we investigated the effects of MSM on osteogenic differentiation of human PDLSCs (hPDLSCs) in vitro and in vivo. Our results demonstrate that MSM not only promotes the proliferation but also promotes osteogenic differentiation of hPDLSCs. MSM increased the expression levels of osteogenic specific markers that ALP, OPN, OCN, Runx2, and OSX. Smad2/3 signaling pathway was reinforced by MSM. Runx2, which downstream of Smad pathway, was expressed in accordance. Consistent with in vitro results, in vivo calvarial defect model and transplantation model revealed that MSM induces hPDLSCs to differentiate into osteoblast, which express ALP, OPN and OCN highly and enhance bone formation. These results suggest that MSM promotes osteogenic differentiation and bone formation of hPDLSCs, and Smad2/3 / Runx2 / OSX / OPN may play critical roles in the MSM-induced osteogenic differentiation. Thus, MSM combined with hPDLSCs may be a good candidate for future clinical applications in alveolar bone regeneration and can be used for graft material in reconstructive dentistry.

Methylsulfonylmethane (MSM) is a natural organosulfur compound that exhibits antioxidative and anti-inflammatory effects. This study was carried out to investigate the effect of MSM on paraquat (PQ)-induced acute lung and liver injury in mice. A single dose of PQ (50 mg/kg, i.p.) induced acute lung and liver toxicity. Mice were treated with MSM (500 mg/kg/day, i.p.) for 5 days. At the end of the experiment, animals were euthanized, and lung and liver tissues were collected for histological and biochemical analysis. Tissue samples were used to determine malondialdehyde (MDA), myeloperoxidase (MPO), catalase (CAT), superoxide dismutase (SOD), glutathione (GSH), and tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α) levels. Blood samples were used to measure plasma alanine transaminase (ALT), γ-glutamyl transferase (GGT), and alkaline phosphatase (ALP). Histological examination indicated that MSM decreased lung and liver damage caused by PQ. Biochemical results showed that MSM treatment significantly reduced tissue levels of MDA, MPO, and TNF-α, while increased the levels of SOD, CAT, and GSH compared with PQ group. MSM treatment also significantly reduced plasma levels of ALT, GGT, and ALP. These findings suggest that MSM as a natural product attenuates PQ-induced pulmonary and hepatic oxidative injury.

Methylsulfonylmethane (MSM) has been reported to provide anti-inflammatory and antioxidant effects in both animal and man. Strenuous resistance exercise has the potential to induce both inflammation and oxidative stress. Using a pilot (proof of concept) study design, we determined the influence of MSM on markers of exercise recovery and performance in healthy men. Eight, healthy men (27.1 ± 6.9 yrs old) who were considered to be moderately exercise-trained (exercising <150 minutes per week) were randomly assigned to ingest MSM at either 1.5 grams per day or 3.0 grams per day for 30 days (28 days before and 2 days following exercise). Before and after the 28 day intervention period, subjects performed 18 sets of knee extension exercise in an attempt to induce muscle damage (and to be used partly as a measure of exercise performance). Sets 1-15 were performed at a predetermined weight for 10 repetitions each, while sets 16-18 were performed to muscular failure. Muscle soreness (using a 5-point Likert scale), fatigue (using the fatigue-inertia subset of the Profile of Mood States), blood antioxidant status (glutathione and Trolox Equivalent Antioxidant Capacity [TEAC]), and blood homocysteine were measured before and after exercise, pre and post intervention. Exercise performance (total work performed during sets 16-18 of knee extension testing) was also measured pre and post intervention. Muscle soreness increased following exercise and a trend was noted for a reduction in muscle soreness with 3.0 grams versus 1.5 grams of MSM (p = 0.080), with a 1.0 point difference between dosages. Fatigue was slightly reduced with MSM (p = 0.073 with 3.0 grams; p = 0.087 for both dosages combined). TEAC increased significantly following exercise with 3.0 grams of MSM (p = 0.035), while homocysteine decreased following exercise for both dosages combined (p = 0.007). No significant effects were noted for glutathione or total work performed during knee extension testing (p > 0.05). MSM, especially when provided at 3.0 grams per day, may favorably influence selected markers of exercise recovery. More work is needed to extend these findings, in particular using a larger sample of subjects and the inclusion of additional markers of exercise recovery and performance.

Oxidative stress and muscle damage occur during exhaustive bouts of exercise, and many runners report pain and soreness as major influences on changes or breaks in training regimens, creating a barrier to training persistence. Methylsulfonylmethane (MSM) is a sulfur-based nutritional supplement that is purported to have pain and inflammation-reducing effects. To investigate the effects of MSM in attenuating damage associated with physical exertion, this randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study evaluated the effects of MSM supplementation on exercise-induced pain, oxidative stress and muscle damage. Twenty-two healthy females (<i>n</i> = 17) and males (<i>n</i> = 5) (age 33.7 ± 6.9 yrs.) were recruited from the 2014 Portland Half-Marathon registrant pool. Participants were randomized to take either MSM (OptiMSM®) (<i>n</i> = 11), or a placebo (<i>n</i> = 11) at 3 g/day for 21 days prior to the race and for two days after (23 total). Participants provided blood samples for measurement of markers of oxidative stress, and completed VAS surveys for pain approximately one month prior to the race (T<sub>0</sub>), and at 15 min (T<sub>1</sub>), 90 min (T<sub>2</sub>), 1 Day (T<sub>3</sub>), and 2 days (T<sub>4</sub>) after race finish. The primary outcome measure 8-hydroxy-2-deoxyguanine (8-OHdG) measured oxidative stress. Secondary outcomes included malondialdehyde (MDA) for oxidative stress, creatine kinase (CK) and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) as measures of muscle damage, and muscle (MP) and joint pain (JP) recorded using a 100 mm Visual Analogue Scale (VAS). Data were analyzed using repeated and multivariate ANOVAs, and simple contrasts compared post-race time points to baseline, presented as mean (SD) or mean change (95% CI) where appropriate. Running a half-marathon induced significant increases in all outcome measures (<i>p</i> < 0.001). From baseline, 8-OHdG increased significantly at T<sub>1</sub> by 1.53 ng/mL (0.86-2.20 ng/mL CI, <i>p</i> < 0.001) and T<sub>2</sub> by 1.19 ng/mL (0.37-2.01 ng/mL CI, <i>p</i> < 0.01), and fell below baseline levels at T<sub>3</sub> by -0.46 ng/mL (-1.18-0.26 CI, <i>p</i> > 0.05) and T<sub>4</sub> by -0.57 ng/mL (-1.27-0.13 CI, <i>p</i> > 0.05). MDA increased significantly at T<sub>1</sub> by 7.3 μM (3.9-10.7 CI, <i>p</i> < 0.001). Muscle damage markers CK and LDH saw significant increases from baseline at all time-points (<i>p</i> < 0.01). Muscle and joint pain increased significantly from baseline at T<sub>1</sub>, T<sub>2</sub>, and T<sub>3</sub> (<i>p</i> < 0.01) and returned to baseline levels at T<sub>4</sub>. Time-by-treatment results did not reach statistical significance for any outcome measure, however, the MSM group saw clinically significant (Δ > 10 mm) reductions in both muscle and joint pain. Participation in a half-marathon was associated with increased markers of oxidative stress, muscle damage, and pain. MSM supplementation was not associated with a decrease from pre-training levels of oxidative stress or muscle damage associated with an acute bout of exercise. MSM supplementation attenuated post-exercise muscle and joint pain at clinically, but not statistically significant levels.

Methylsulfonylmethane (MSM) is a naturally occurring sulfur containing substance that has been shown to have anti-inflammatory and antioxidative properties. Previous studies using MSM as an oral supplement to improve pain in those patients with knee osteoarthritis have shown superiority compared to placebo. However, these studies are not translatable to active individuals performing high impact activities and have not evaluated MSM as a preventative measure. A total of 180 subjects ranging in age from 18 to 40 years were enrolled. Subjects were randomized into 2 groups receiving either 3 grams OptiMSM methylsulfonylmethane (Bergstrom Nutrition, Vancouver, WA) or a placebo for 8 weeks. Outcomes measured were the Knee Osteoarthritis Outcome Score (KOOS) and the Profile of Moods States (POMS). Three grams of MSM administered daily did not provide significant improvements in the 5 KOOS subscales or the 6 POMS subscales at 30 days or 60 days. Although 3 grams of MSM daily can be used safely, there does not appear to be a significant improvement in KOOS or POMS.

<i>Background</i>. Inflammation is associated with strenuous exercise and methylsulfonylmethane (MSM) has been shown to have anti-inflammatory properties. <i>Methods</i>. Physically active men were supplemented with either placebo or MSM (3 grams per day) for 28 days before performing 100 repetitions of eccentric knee extension exercise. <i>Ex vivo</i> and <i>in vitro</i> testing consisted of evaluating cytokine production in blood (whole blood and isolated peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs)) exposed to lipopolysaccharide (LPS), before and through 72 hours after exercise, while <i>in vivo</i> testing included the evaluation of cytokines before and through 72 hours after exercise. <i>Results</i>. LPS stimulation of whole blood after MSM supplementation resulted in decreased induction of IL-1<i>β</i>, with no effect on IL-6, TNF-<i>α</i>, or IL-8. After exercise, there was a reduced response to LPS in the placebo, but MSM resulted in robust release of IL-6 and TNF-<i>α</i>. A small decrease in resting levels of proinflammatory cytokines was noted with MSM, while an acute postexercise increase in IL-10 was observed with MSM. <i>Conclusion</i>. Strenuous exercise causes a robust inflammatory reaction that precludes the cells from efficiently responding to additional stimuli. MSM appears to dampen the release of inflammatory molecules in response to exercise, resulting in a less incendiary environment, allowing cells to still have the capacity to mount an appropriate response to an additional stimulus after exercise.

Methylsulfonylmethane (MSM), which is one of the popular ingredients of so-called health foods in Japan, is expected to relieve inflammation in arthritis and allergies. However, there is no scientific evidence to confirm the efficacy and safety of MSM in detail. In this study, we examined the effects of MSM on cartilage formation in growing rats (G) and cartilage degradation in STR/Ort mice (A), an accepted human osteoarthritis (OA) model. For cartilage formation study, 6-week-old growing male Wister rats were assigned to four groups to receive a control or MSM-containing diet. To examine the efficacy of MSM on the cartilage of OA model mouse, 10-week-old male STR/OrtCrlj mice were assigned to three groups to receive a control or MSM-containing diet. The dosages used were amounts equal to the recommended supplements for humans [0.06 g/kg body weight (BW)/day: MSM1G and MSM1A], 10 fold higher (0.6 g/kg BW/day: MSM10G and MSM10A), and 100 fold higher (6 g/kg BW/day: MSM100G). Intake of MSM for 4 weeks did not affect cartilage formation in the knee joint in growing rats. Body, liver, and spleen weight in the MSM100G group were significantly lower than those in the control group. Intake of MSM for 13 weeks decreased degeneration of the cartilage at the joint surface in the knee joints in STR/Ort mice in a dose-dependent manner. These results suggest that appropriate intake of MSM is possibly effective in OA model mice; however, intake of large amounts of MSM induced atrophy of several organs.

Methylsulfonylmethane (MSM), naturally occurring in green plants, fruits and vegetables, has been shown to exert anti-inflammatory and antioxidant effects. MSM is an organosulfur compound and a normal oxidative metabolite of dimethyl sulfoxide. This study was carried out to investigate the effect of MSM in a rat model of experimental colitis. Colitis was induced by intracolonic instillation of 1 ml of 5% of acetic acid. Rats were treated with MSM (400 mg/kg/day, orally) for 4 days. Animals were euthanized and distal colon evaluated histologically and biochemically. Tissue samples were used to measurement of malondialdehyde (MDA), myeloperoxidase (MPO), catalase (CAT), glutathione (GSH) and proinflammatory cytokine (TNF-α and IL-1β) levels. Results showed that MSM decreased macroscopic and microscopic colonic damage scores caused by administration of acetic acid. MSM treatment also significantly reduced colonic levels of MDA, MPO and IL-1β, while increased the levels of GSH and CAT compared with acetic acid-induced colitis group. It seems that MSM as a natural product may have a protective effect in an experimental ulcerative colitis.

Methylsulfonylmethane (MSM) is a popular dietary supplement used in a variety of conditions including pain, inflammation, allergies, arthritis, parasitic infections and the maintenance of normal keratin levels in hair, skin and nails. Despite its popularity, there is little published toxicology data on MSM. The objective of this study was to evaluate the acute and subchronic toxicity of MSM in rats at a dose five to seven times the maximum recommended dose in humans. MSM administered in a single gavage dose of 2 g/kg resulted in no adverse events or mortality. MSM administered as a daily dose of 1.5 g/kg for 90 days by gavage resulted in no adverse events or mortality. Necropsy did not reveal any gross pathological lesions or changes in organ weights. Renal histology of treated animals was normal. It is concluded that MSM is well tolerated in rats at an acute dose of 2 g/kg and at a subacute chronic dose of 1.5 g/kg.

Methylsulfonylmethane (MSM) is an organosulfur compound and the health benefits associated with MSM include inflammation. Although MSM has been shown to have various physiological effects, no study has yet focused on inflammasome activation. The inflammasome is a multiprotein complex that serves as a platform for caspase 1-dependent proteolytic maturation and secretion of interleukin-1β (IL-1β). In this study, we tested the effect of MSM on inflammasome activation using mouse and human macrophages. In our results, MSM significantly attenuated NLRP3 inflammasome activation in lipopolysaccharide-primed macrophages, although it had no effect on NLCR4 or AIM2 inflammasome activation. Extracts of MSM-enriched vegetables presented the same inhibitory effect on NLRP3 inflammasome activation as MSM. MSM also attenuated the transcriptional expression of IL-1α, IL-1β, IL-6, and NLRP3. Taken together, these results show that MSM has anti-inflammatory characteristics, interrupts NLRP3 inflammasome activation, and inhibits pro-cytokine expression. We further confirmed the intracellular mechanism of MSM in relation to NLRP3 inflammasome activation, followed by comparison with that of DMSO. Both chemicals showed a synergic effect on anti-NLRP3 activation and attenuated production of mitochondrial reactive oxygen species (ROS). Thus, MSM is a selective inhibitor of NLRP3 inflammasome activation and can be developed as a supplement to control several metabolic disorders.

High glucose-induced inflammation leads to atherosclerosis, which is considered a major cause of death in type 1 and type 2 diabetic patients. Nuclear factor-kappa B (NF-κB) plays a central role in high glucose-induced inflammation and is activated through toll-like receptors (TLRs) as well as canonical and protein kinase C-dependent (PKC) pathways. Non-toxic sulfur (NTS) and methylsulfonylmethane (MSM) are two sulfur-containing natural compounds that can induce anti-inflammation. Using Western blotting, real-time polymerase chain reaction, and flow cytometry, we found that high glucose-induced inflammation occurs through activation of TLRs. An effect of NTS and MSM on canonical and PKC-dependent NF-κB pathways was also demonstrated by western blotting. The effects of proinflammatory cytokines were investigated using a chromatin immunoprecipitation assay and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Our results showed inhibition of the glucose-induced expression of TLR2 and TLR4 by NTS and MSM. These sulfur compounds also inhibited NF-κB activity through reactive oxygen species (ROS)-mediated canonical and PKC-dependent pathways. Finally, NTS and MSM inhibited the high glucose-induced expression of interleukin (IL)-1β, IL-6, and tumor necrosis factor-α and binding of NF-κB protein to the DNA of proinflammatory cytokines. Together, these results suggest that NTS and MSM may be potential drug candidates for anti-inflammation therapy.

The development of various cardiovascular diseases (CVDs) are associated with chronic inflammation. Tumor necrosis factor α (TNF-α) is a pro-inflammatory cytokine that activates the nuclear factor-κB (NF-κB) signaling pathway, leading to increased inflammatory cytokine expression, such as interleukin-6 (IL-6). Interventions to reduce each of these factors have been demonstrated to reduce the development of CVD. Methylsulfonylmethane (MSM) is a naturally occurring compound that demonstrates anti-inflammatory effects in humans and various animal and cell culture models. The effects of MSM include decreased NF-κB activation, decreased expression of TNF-α, and IL-6. However, the effects of MSM within the heart have not yet been examined. Therefore, the purpose of this investigation was to determine whether MSM protects cardiac cells from inflammation that occurs in response to pro-inflammatory stimuli. A novel immortalized human ventricular cardiomyocyte cell line, designated Ac16, developed and characterized in the laboratory of Dr. Mercy Davidson, Columbia Invention Report No. 823, U.S. patent No. 7,223,599 were utilized. Cells were treated with TNF-α, alone or in combination with MSM. To confirm an appropriate dosage of MSM, the effect of various concentrations on cell viability, and IL-6 production were examined. The effect of MSM on transcript expression of pro-inflammatory markers and activation of NF-κB were examined with the established dose by real-time quantitative PCR and western blot, respectively. MSM treatment combined with TNF-α significantly decreased IL-6 production and transcript expression compared to TNF-α alone. These findings indicate that MSM may protect against inflammation in the heart, and thereby protect against inflammation-linked CVDs. Further study is warranted to determine the effect of MSM on cardiovascular health outcomes.

Methylsulfonylmethane (MSM) is a natural organosulfur compound has been widely used as a dietary supplement. MSM has protective effects against various disorders through its anti-inflammatory and antioxidant properties however the effect of MSM on gastric mucosal injury remains unclear. The aim of the present study is to determine whether MSM has beneficial effects on ethanol/HCl-induced gastric ulcer in mice. Macroscopic and histopathological evaluation of gastric mucosa revealed that ethanol/HCl administration produced apparent mucosal injuries, while pretreatment with MSM (200 and 400mg/kg, orally) could effectively protect gastric mucosa against the injuries caused by acidified ethanol. MSM significantly increased the levels of glutathione (GSH), catalase (CAT) and prostaglandin E<sub>2</sub> (PGE<sub>2</sub>), and decreased the levels of malondialdehyde (MDA), myeloperoxidase (MPO), carbonyl protein, and nitric oxide (NO) in gastric tissues compared with those in the ethanol group. MSM suppressed gastric inflammation by reducing the levels of proinflammatory cytokines tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-α, interleukin (IL)-1β, IL-6, monocyte chemoattractant protein (MCP)-1 and matrix metalloproteinase (MMP)-9. Moreover, pretreatment of mice with MSM decreased the expression of nuclear factor kappa B (NF-κB) as a key regulator of inflammation in gastric mucosa. Taken together, these data suggest that MSM is able to decrease the severity of ethanol/HCl-induced gastric mucosal injury through inhibition of oxidative stress and inflammation.

Osteoclast differentiation is dependent on the activities of receptor activator NF-kB ligand (RANKL) and macrophage colony-stimulating factor (M-CSF). Given that RANKL plays a critical role in osteoclast formation and bone resorption, any new compounds found to alter its activity would be predicted to have therapeutic potential for disorders associated with bone loss. Methylsulfonylmethane (MSM) is a naturally occurring sulfur compound with well-documented anti-oxidant and anti-inflammatory properties; currently its effects on osteoclast differentiation are unknown. We sought to investigate whether MSM could regulate osteoclastogenesis, and if so, its mechanism of action. In this study, we investigated the effects of MSM on RANKL-induced osteoclast differentiation, together with STAT3's involvement in the expression of osteoclastic gene markers. These experiments were conducted using bone marrow derived macrophages (BMMs) and cell line material, together with analyses that interrogated both protein and mRNA levels, as well as signaling pathway activity. Although MSM was not toxic to osteoclast precursors, MSM markedly inhibited RANKL-induced TRAP activity, multinucleated osteoclast formation, and bone resorptive activity. Additionally, the expression of several osteoclastogenesis-related marker genes, including TRAF6, c-Fos, NFATc1, cathepsin K, and OSCAR were suppressed by MSM. MSM mediated suppression of RANKL-induced osteoclastogenesis involved inhibition of ITAM signaling effectors such as PLCγ and Syk, with a blockade of NF-kB rather than MAPK activity. Furthermore, MSM inhibited RANKL-induced phosphorylation of STAT3 Ser727. Knockdown of STAT3 using shRNAs resulted in reduced RANKL-mediated phosphorylation of Ser727 STAT3, and TRAF6 in cells for which depletion of STAT3 was confirmed. Additionally, the expression of RANKL-induced osteoclastogenic marker genes were significantly decreased by MSM and STAT3 knockdown. Taken together, these results indicate that STAT3 plays a pivotal role in RANKL-induced osteoclast formation, and that MSM can attenuate RANKL-induced osteoclastogenesis by blocking both NF-kB and STAT3 activity.

Until now glucosamine sulfate (GS) has been the most widely used supplement and has been shown to be efficacious in the treatment of osteoarthritis (OA). Methylsulfonylmethane (MSM) and boswellic acids (BA) are new effective supplements for the management of inflammation and joint degeneration, according to previous experimental studies. The aim of our study is to test the effectiveness of association of MSM and BA in comparison with GS in knee arthritis.In this prospective randomized clinical trial, MEBAGA (Methylsulfonylmethane and Boswellic Acids versus Glucosamine sulfate in the treatment of knee Arthritis), 120 participants affected by arthritis of the knee were randomly assigned to an experimental group (MB group) or a control group (GS group) treated for 60 days with 5 g of MSM and 7.2 mg of BA or with 1500 mg of GS daily, respectively. At the 2-month (T1) and 6-months (T2) follow-up , the efficacy of these two nutraceuticals was assessed using the visual analog pain scale (VAS) and the Lequesne Index (LI) for joint function, along with the use of anti-inflammatory drugs (non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs and anti-cyclooxygenase-2).The repeated measures ANOVA analysis shows that for VAS, LI, and the use of anti-inflammatory drugs scores there are improvements due to the time in the two groups (respectively, F=26.0; P<0.0001; F=4.15; P=0.02; F=3.38; P=0.04), with a tendency to better values for the MB group at T2.On the basis of these preliminary data, we could support the efficacy of the MSM in association with BA in the treatment of OA. These results are consistent with the anti-inflammatory and chondroprotective effects previously occurred in experimental studies. This new combination of integration (MSM and BS) has presented good results and satisfactory in comparison with GS, until now the cornerstone of the treatment of arthritis in according to guidelines.

Glucosamine, classified as a slow-acting drug in osteoarthritis (SADOA), is an efficacious chondroprotective agent. Methylsulfonylmethane (MSM), the isoxidised form of dimethyl-sulfoxide (DSMO), is an effective natural analgesic and anti-inflammatory agent. The aim of this study was to compare the efficacy and safety of oral glucosamine (Glu), methylsulfonylmethane (MSM), their combination and placebo in osteoarthritis of the knee. A total of 118 patients of either sex with mild to moderate osteoarthritis were included in the study and randomised to receive either Glu 500mg, MSM 500mg, Glu and MSM or placebo capsules three times daily for 12 weeks. Patients were evaluated at 0 (before drug administration), 2, 4, 8 and 12 weeks post-treatment for efficacy and safety. The efficacy parameters studied were the pain index, the swelling index, visual analogue scale pain intensity, 15m walking time, the Lequesne index, and consumption of rescue medicine. Glu, MSM and their combination significantly improved signs and symptoms of osteoarthritis compared with placebo. There was a statistically significant decrease in mean (+/- SD) pain index from 1.74 +/- 0.47 at baseline to 0.65 +/- 0.71 at week 12 with Glu (p < 0.001). MSM significantly decreased the mean pain index from 1.53 +/- 0.51 to 0.74 +/- 0.65, and combination treatment resulted in a more significant decrease in the mean pain index (1.7 +/- 0.47 to 0.36 +/- 0.33; p < 0.001). After 12 weeks, the mean swelling index significantly decreased with Glu and MSM, while the decrease in swelling index with combination therapy was greater (1.43 +/- 0.63 to 0.14 +/- 0.35; p < 0.05) after 12 weeks. The combination produced a statistically significant decrease in the Lequesne index. All treatments were well tolerated. Glu, MSM and their combination produced an analgesic and anti-inflammatory effect in osteoarthritis. Combination therapy showed better efficacy in reducing pain and swelling and in improving the functional ability of joints than the individual agents. All the treatments were well tolerated. The onset of analgesic and anti-inflammatory activity was found to be more rapid with the combination than with Glu. It can be concluded that the combination of MSM with Glu provides better and more rapid improvement in patients with osteoarthritis.

Rotator cuff tears (RCTs) and rotator cuff disease (RCD) are important causes of disability in middle-aged individuals affected by nontraumatic shoulder dysfunctions. Our previous studies have demonstrated that four different hyaluronic acid preparations (HAPs), including Artrosulfur<sup>®</sup> hyaluronic acid (HA) (Alfakjn S.r.l., Garlasco, Italy), may exert a protective effect in human RCT-derived tendon cells undergoing oxidative stress damage. Recently, methylsulfonylmethane (MSM) (Barentz, Paderno Dugnano, Italy) has proven to have anti-inflammatory properties and to cause pain relief in patients affected by tendinopathies. This study aims at evaluating three preparations (Artrosulfur<sup>®</sup> HA, MSM, and Artrosulfur<sup>®</sup> MSM + HA) in the recovery from hydrogen peroxide-induced oxidative stress damage in human tenocyte. Cell proliferation, Lactate Dehydrogenase (LDH) release, and inducible nitric oxide synthases (iNOS) and prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) modulation were investigated. In parallel, expression of metalloproteinases 2 (MMP2) and 14 (MMP14) and collagen types I and III were also examined. Results demonstrate that Artrosulfur<sup>®</sup> MSM + HA improves cell escape from oxidative stress by decreasing cytotoxicity and by reducing iNOS and PGE2 secretion. Furthermore, it differentially modulates MMP2 and MMP14 levels and enhances collagen III expression after 24 h, proteins globally related to rapid acceleration of the extracellular matrix (ECM) remodelling and thus tendon healing. By improving the anti-cytotoxic effect of HA, the supplementation of MSM may represent a feasible strategy to ameliorate cuff tendinopathies.

Methylsulfonylmethane (MSM) is a commonly used diet supplement believed to decrease the inflammation in joints and fastens recovery in osteoarthritis, gastric mucosal injury, or obesity-related disorders. It was also suggested that MSM might play a beneficial role in cancer treatment. So far, the MSM might have a potentially beneficial effect in endometrial cancer (EC) treatment. This study evaluated the effect and usefulness of MSM in combinatory therapy with known drug doxorubicin (DOX). The effect of combinational treatment of MSM and DOX on the induction of apoptosis was evaluated in EC cell lines (ISHIKAWA, MFE-296, MFE-280). We observed that MSM itself induces apoptosis in EC cell lines, and pre-treatment with MSM for 24 h increases the sensitivity of EC cells to DOX-induced apoptosis and DNA damage and that effect might be regulated by p42/44 (Erk1/2) MAPK and Akt (protein kinase B). These results for the first time show that MSM might act as a sensitizer of EC cells to known drugs, for which EC cells quickly acquire resistance. Graphical abstract.

Methylsulfonylmethane (MSM), also known as dimethyl sulfone and methyl sulfone, is an organic sulfur-containing compound that occurs naturally in a variety of fruits, vegetables, grains, and animals, including humans. In the present study, we demonstrated the anti-inflammatory effects of MSM in lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-stimulated murine macrophages, RAW264.7 cells. MSM significantly inhibited the release of nitric oxide and prostaglandin E(2) by alleviating the expression of inducible nitric oxide synthase and cyclooxygenase-2 in LPS-stimulated RAW264.7 cells. Furthermore, the levels of interleukin-6 and tumor necrosis factor-alpha were decreased by MSM treatment in cell culture supernatants. Further study indicated that the translocation of the p65 subunit of nuclear factor (NF)-kappaB to the nucleus was inhibited by MSM treatment in LPS-stimulated RAW264.7 cells, in which it helped block degradation of inhibitor of NF-kappaB. In addition, in vivo studies demonstrated that topical administration of MSM at 500-1250 microg/ear resulted in similar inhibitory activities in 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol 13-acetate-induced mouse ear edema. Collectively, theses results indicate that MSM inhibits LPS-induced release of pro-inflammatory mediators in murine macrophages through downregulation of NF-kappaB signaling.
