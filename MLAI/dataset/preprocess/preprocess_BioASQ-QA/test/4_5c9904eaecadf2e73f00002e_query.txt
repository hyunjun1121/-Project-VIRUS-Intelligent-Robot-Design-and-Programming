Amphibian granular glands provide a wide range of compounds on the skin that defend against pathogens and predators. We identified three bufadienolides-the steroid-like compounds arenobufagin, gamabufotalin, and telocinobufagin-from the boreal toad, Anaxyrus boreas, through liquid chromatography mass spectrometry (LC/MS). Compounds were detected both after inducing skin gland secretions and in constitutive mucosal rinses from toads. We described the antimicrobial properties of each bufadienolide against Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis (Bd), an amphibian fungal pathogen linked with boreal toad population declines. All three bufadienolides were found to inhibit Bd growth at similar levels. The maximum Bd inhibition produced by arenobufagin, gamabufotalin, and telocinobufagin were approximately 50%, in contrast to the complete Bd inhibition shown by antimicrobial skin peptides produced by some amphibian species. In addition, skin mucus samples significantly reduced Bd viability, and bufadienolides were detected in 15 of 62 samples. Bufadienolides also appeared to enhance growth of the anti-Bd bacterium Janthinobacterium lividum, and thus may be involved in regulation of the skin microbiome. Here, we localized skin bacteria within the mucus layer and granular glands of toads with fluorescent in situ hybridization. Overall, our results suggest that bufadienolides can function in antifungal defense on amphibian skin and their production is a potentially convergent trait similar to antimicrobial peptide defenses found on the skin of other species. Further studies investigating bufadienolide expression across toad populations, their regulation, and interactions with other components of the skin mucosome will contribute to understanding the complexities of amphibian immune defense.

Gamabufotalin (CS-6), a major bufadienolide of Chansu, has been used for cancer therapy due to its desirable metabolic stability and less adverse effect. However, the underlying mechanism of CS-6 involved in anti-tumor activity remains poorly understood. The biological functions of gamabufotalin (CS-6) were investigated by migration, colony formation and apoptosis assays in NSCLC cells. The nuclear localization and interaction between transcriptional co-activator p300 and NF-κB p50/p65 and their binding to COX-2 promoter were analyzed after treatment with CS-6. Molecular docking study was used to simulate the interaction of CS-6 with IKKβ. The in vivo anti-tumor efficacy of CS-6 was also analyzed in xenografts nude mice. Western blot was used to detect the protein expression level. Gamabufotalin (CS-6) strongly suppressed COX-2 expression by inhibiting the phosphorylation of IKKβ via targeting the ATP-binding site, thereby abrogating NF-κB binding and p300 recruitment to COX-2 promoter. In addition, CS-6 induced apoptosis by activating the cytochrome c and caspase-dependent apoptotic pathway. Moreover, CS-6 markedly down-regulated the protein levels of COX-2 and phosphorylated p65 NF-κB in tumor tissues of the xenograft mice, and inhibited tumor weight and size. Our study provides pharmacological evidence that CS-6 exhibits potential use in the treatment of COX-2-mediated diseases such as lung cancer.

Deciding appropriate therapy for multiple myeloma (MM) is challenging because of the occurrence of multiple chromosomal changes and the fatal nature of the disease. In the current study, gamabufotalin (GBT) was isolated from toad venom, and its tumor-specific cytotoxicity was investigated in human MM cells. We found GBT inhibited cell growth and induced apoptosis with the IC50 values <50 nM. Mechanistic studies using functional approaches identified GBT as an inhibitor of c-Myc. Further analysis showed that GBT especially evoked the ubiquitination and degradation of c-Myc protein, thereby globally repressing the expression of c-Myc target genes. GBT treatment inhibited ERK and AKT signals, while stimulating the activation of JNK cascade. An E3 ubiquitin-protein ligase, WWP2, was upregulated following JNK activation and played an important role in c-Myc ubiquitination and degradation through direct protein-protein interaction. The antitumor effect of GBT was validated in a xenograft mouse model and the suppression of MM-induced osteolysis was verified in a SCID-hu model in vivo. Taken together, our study identified the potential of GBT as a promising therapeutic agent in the treatment of MM.

Toad venom (Chansu) is prepared from the dried secretion of parotid gland and skin gland from Bufo bufo gargarizans or B. melanostictus. Up to now, much attention shall be paid to the poor quality of commercial toad venom because of the adulteration. So, it is urgent to establish a scientific and perfect quality control method to improve the quality of toad venom and guarantee its safety and effectiveness in clinical application. The different batches of toad venom samples were assayed by high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) and the quantitative analysis of multi-components by single marker (QAMS) was used to detect the contents of five bufagenins. As a result, the reference characteristic chromatogram was established, displaying serotonin, gamabufotalin, arenobufagin, hellebrigenin, telocinobufagin, bufotalin, cinobufotalin, bufalin, cinobufagin and resibufogenin as characteristic peaks. Taking cinobufagin as an internal reference substance, QAMS was verified for the determination of five bufagenins (gamabufotalin, bufotalin, bufalin, cinobufagin, resibufogenin) in toad venom samples. The durability and applicability of the relative correction factor (RCF) were also studied systematically. RCFs of cinobufagin to gamabufotalin, bufotalin, bufalin and resibufogenin were determined as 1.05, 0.895, 1.09 and 0.913, respectively. The characteristic chromatogram and QAMS established in this study could effectively control the quality of toad venom and provide scientific evidence for the improvement of the quality standard of the toad venom to be described in Chinese Pharmacopoeia (2020 edition).
