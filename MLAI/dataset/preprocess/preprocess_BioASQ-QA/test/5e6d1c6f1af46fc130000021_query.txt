In the present study the pineal gland was examined in 2 outbred stocks and 6 inbred strains of rats some of which were pigmented to varying degrees, to see whether inbreeding affects the variability and whether differences exist between albino and pigmented rats. The animals were kept under 12 h light: 12 h darkness (12 L:12 D) and killed 7 h after the onset of light and darkness, respectively. The parameters examined were pineal protein content, serotonin and melatonin levels and hydroxyindole-O-methyltransferase (HIOMT) activity. All the parameters examined revealed interstrain differences, independently of whether the data were expressed per pineal or per mg protein. The variation coefficients for the various parameters were relatively high. They were mostly smaller when the data were expressed per pineal rather than per mg protein. No striking differences existed between the variation coefficients in inbred and outbred rats. When pineal size and the melatonin-related parameters expressed per pineal were used to assess the melatonin-synthesizing capacity of the pineal glands, it was found that the outbred Wistar and Sprague-Dawley rats and the inbred LEWIS-derived (LEW/Han) rats, all of which were albinos, had the most active pineals. Intermediate activity was noted in the hooded E3/Han and BDE/Han and the albino BDII/Han rats. The smallest and least active pineals were found in the totally pigmented BN/Han and DA/Han rats. The results taken together show that different stocks and strains exhibit significant differences in pineal size and melatonin-forming capacity. Albino rats appear to have larger and more active pineals than pigmented rats.

Time-related changes in the incidences of spontaneous neoplasms in skin (fibroma and keratoacanthoma), thyroid (C-cell and follicular cell adenomas/carcinomas), uterus (stromal polyp), testes (Leydig cell tumor) and hemolymphoreticular system (mesenteric lymph node hemangioma and malignant granular lymphocytic leukemia) were assessed statistically in Wistar, Sprague-Dawley and F344 rats employed by the BASF, Germany and major European contract research organizations over the last 20 years. Negative trends (5 out of 80 cases) were observed for skin fibromas in F344 males, for follicular cell adenomas in Han Wistar females and in Sprague-Dawley males and females, and for follicular cell carcinomas in Sprague-Dawley males. Positive trends (8 out of 80 cases) were observed for skin keratoacanthomas in Han Wistar males, for C-cell adenomas in BASF Wistar males and females, for stromal polyps in Han Wistar and Sprague-Dawley females, and for mesenteric lymph node hemangiomas in Han Wistar and Sprague-Dawley males and in BASF Wistar females. In 67 out of 80 cases there were no statistically significant trends. Tumor drift was not common but occurred far more often in outbred rat strains (Wistar and Sprague-Dawley) than in the inbred rat strain (F344). This observation suggests that tumor predisposition is genetically determined, that tumor drift is primarily caused by genetic drift and that non-genotoxic carcinogens operate by facilitating the expression of tumor predisposition in target cells.

In 2006 the National Toxicology Program (NTP) of the FDA shifted to the preferred use of Wistar-Han rats from the more commonly used Sprague-Dawley (SD) strain - and industry followed. While European laboratories preferred the Wistar-Han line, there was a paucity of relevant historical control data in many US research institutions for the new "industry standard" rat strain. In 2010 the NTP reversed its decision and shifted back to SD rats because of reproductive issues with the Wistar strain. For post hoc comparative analyses, we report minimal practical differences in Functional Observational Battery (FOB) data from a large sample of male and female Wistar-Han and SD rats. In summarizing data from the preclinical safety evaluations of the CNS effects of new drugs using the FOB, it is crucial to understand the value of not only how the functional expression of drug effects in the rat are predictive of the human response, but also how and why they differ. What we can predict from the behavioral and physiological response of the designated test system to drug administration is the foundation of "generalizability" to the human's response. Here, we conclude that the use of either SD or WH rat strains in standard CNS safety studies provide equivalent supportive data for CNS safety assessment required for IND approval under the harmonized guidelines.

Laboratory strains of rats are a commonly used subject to study play behavior. Recent research has shown that play in one laboratory strain of rat (e.g., Long-Evans hooded) differs in a number of ways from its wild counterparts. These findings suggest that domestication affects some aspects of play behavior. However, there are multiple strains of laboratory rats, which have been domesticated through different lineages all derived from wild rats and it cannot be assumed that all domestic strains are identical in their play. Therefore, the aim of this study was to compare the play behavior of three other strains of laboratory rats (e.g., Wistar, Sprague-Dawley, and Brown Norway). All strains were similar to each other as they all engaged in high frequencies of play, tolerated similar interanimal distances before initiating playful defense and displayed similar acrobatic capacities, suggesting domestication produces some common changes in play and other factors that influence play. However, strains differed significantly from one another in the use of tactics that promote bodily contact during play. Indeed, in this regard, some strains were more similar to wild rats than others, suggesting that some domestication-induced changes are either unique or more prominent in some laboratory strains than others. Such a mosaic pattern of transformation not only offers the possibility of using strain differences to characterize the genetic factors contributing to different facets of play, but also cautions researchers from making rat-general conclusions from studies on any one strain.

The aim of this study was to determine the range and incidences of spontaneous microscopic lesions of the pituitary gland in control Han-Wistar and Sprague-Dawley rats and CD-1 mice from 104-week carcinogenicity studies carried out between 1998 and 2010 at Charles River Edinburgh. In both strains of rats and in CD-1 mice, non-proliferative lesions of the pituitary gland were generally uncommon, excluding cysts/pseudocysts (6.42% in Han-Wistar rats, 5.85% in Sprague-Dawley rats, and 2.08% in CD-1 mice). Primary proliferative lesions were most frequently found in the pars distalis of the pituitary gland. Adenomas and carcinomas of the pars distalis were more common in Sprague-Dawley rats (49.33% and 2.85%, respectively) than in Han-Wistar rats (27.29% and 0.21%, respectively), and adenomas in both strains of rats and CD-1 mice exhibited a marked sex predisposition, with females more commonly affected.

The aims of the present study were to determine cytochrome P450 enzyme activity in six strains of experimental rodents (n = 5/sex/species): ICR, C57BL/6 and DBA/2 mice; Sprague Dawley and Wistar rats; and Dunkin Hartley guinea pigs. After animals were treated with the typical inducers β-naphthoflavone (BNF), dexamethasone (DEX) and phenobarbital (PB), the levels of O-dealkylation of ethoxyresorufin (EROD), methoxyresorufin (MROD), pentoxyresorufin (PROD) and benzyloxyresorufin (BROD) activity were determined using responsive catalytic reactions to study CYP1A1, CYP1A2 and CYP2B, respectively. A maximal induction of EROD and MROD was found in BNF-treated animals from all strains (2.4- to 15.1-fold) except DBA/2 (0.9- to 1.8-fold). C57BL/6 mice had the strongest BNF-induced EROD (15.1-fold) and MROD (8.3-fold) activities. No differences in BNF-induced EROD and MROD activities were observed between males and females. However, the EROD activity of Wistar rats and the MROD activity of Sprague Dawley rats were higher in males than females. DEX induced PROD activity only in mice (1.3- to 7.1-fold), but not in rats and guinea pigs (0.2- to 1.1-fold). However, induction of BROD activity was found in DEX-treated mice and rats (1.5 to 12.5-fold), but not in guinea pigs (0.3 to 0.4-fold). PB caused a significant elevation of PROD (1.7- to 10.4-fold) and BROD (31- to 13.2-fold) activities in all the animals. PB-induced BROD activity was higher in females than males in Sprague Dawley rats. These observations strongly suggest that the choice of experimental animal strain, species and inducer is of critical importance for studies of drug metabolism and interaction.

Strain-related differences in animals' cognitive ability affect the outcomes of experiments and may be responsible for discrepant results obtained by different research groups. Therefore, behavioral phenotyping of laboratory animals belonging to different strains is important. The aim of the present study was to compare the variation in allothetic visuospatial learning in most commonly used laboratory rat strains: inbred Wistar (W) and Sprague-Dawley (SD), outcrossed Wistar/Sprague-Dawley (W/SD), and outbred Long Evans (LE) rats. All rats were trained to the arbitrary performance criterion of 83 % correct responses in the partially baited 12-arm radial maze allowing for simultaneous evaluation of both working and reference memory. In the present study, testing albino versus pigmented and inbred versus outcrossed rats revealed significant strain-dependent differences with the inbred SD rats manifesting lower performance on all learning measures compared to other strains. On the other hand, the outcrossed W/SD rats showed a lower frequency of reference memory errors and faster rate of task acquisition compared to both LE and W rats, with W rats showing a lower frequency of working memory errors compared to other strains. In conclusion, albinism apparently did not reduce the animals' performance in the allothetic visuospatial learning task, while outcrossing improved the spatial learning. A differential effect of strain on the contribution of each error type to the animals' overall performance was observed. The strain-dependent differences were more pronounced between subpopulations of learning-deficient individuals ("poor" learners), and generally the reference memory errors contributed more to the final behavioral output than did the working memory errors.

A cross-laboratory analytic evaluation of a commercially available human inhibin B ELISA for measuring inhibin B in rat serum and plasma has been undertaken. Dilution linearity, spiked recovery, intra- and inter-assay precision, functional sensitivity, matrix effects, and frozen stability were assessed across five laboratories. Reference ranges were generated for male Sprague Dawley and Han Wistar rats. Acceptable performance was defined as an overall assay coefficient of variation ≤ 20% with an intraday LLOQ ≤ 20 pg/ml. Intra- and inter-assay precision and functional sensitivity (≤6.4 pg/ml) generally met these criteria, but with occasional evidence of greater variability, particularly at lower concentrations. Dilution linearity was acceptable with occasional low recovery. Acceptable recovery of kit calibrators from rat serum confirmed the absence of matrix effects. Matched serum and plasma samples gave comparable results. The signal increased on freezing, remained constant for ≥3 freeze-thaw cycles and was generally stable for at least 8 weeks. Mean inhibin B ranged from 33.5 to 140.6 pg/ml in adult rats across laboratories, with some evidence for a decline from 6 to 9 weeks of age. Power calculations using preliminary reference range data indicated 10 animals/group would generally detect a 40% decrease in inhibin B at AstraZeneca, but laboratories with lower control values would require larger groups. The assay meets the analytical performance criteria; however, precision at the low end of the standard curve, biological variability, and low control values observed in some laboratories indicate that the utility of the assay may be limited in some laboratories.

A substantial quantity of data on Sprague-Dawley (SD) and Hannover Wistar rats strains have been published concerning their source, diet, and housing conditions, as well as the incidences of nonneoplastic lesions and neoplasms observed in different laboratories. Differences between the commonly used rat strains provided by different breeders (i.e., CD (SD) vs. Harlan Sprague-Dawley strain or Crl: WI(Han) vs. Wistar Hannover (Han)-derived strain, continued breeding by RCC Ltd., Switzerland, thereafter continued breeding by Harlan) may include, but are not limited to, body weight, incidence, and onset of major nonneoplastic lesions and neoplasms, and these can impact the development of a nonclinical safety program. Fisher 344 (F344) and SD rat strains generally have the highest tumor incidences, exceeding that in Wistar rats. Certain tumors are more commonly observed in one strain, and for some, the difference in incidence may be so significant that the tumor may even be considered characteristic for a specific strain (e.g., thymoma in Wistar and amphophilic renal adenoma in SD).

The Sprague Dawley (SD) and Han Wistar (HW) are the two most commonly used rat strains in Europe and the US, with the Han Wistar increasing in popularity because of its greater longevity and lower tumor burden. This survey was undertaken at Covance CRS (Huntingdon and Eye) to compare in-house longevity and common spontaneous tumor profiles of the two strains with published data. Data were compiled from 104-week studies started between 2010 and 2017. Mean survival was greater for both sexes of HWs when compared with SDs. Pituitary tumors were the commonest in both strains, with slightly higher incidences and more malignant tumors in SDs of both sexes. Mammary tumors were the second most common tumor in both strains; the incidence being greater in SDs compared to HWs. Benign pheochromocytomas of the adrenal and fibromas of the skin/subcutis were commoner in male SDs than in HWs. Granular cell tumors of the uterine tract were recorded only in SDs, but uterine stromal and glandular tumors were more common in HWs, which also displayed a higher incidence of granulosa cell tumors of the ovaries. Vascular tumors of the mesenteric lymph nodes, thymomas and follicular cell tumors of the thyroids were recorded at a higher incidence in HWs than in SDs. Tumor profiles of other common tumors were broadly similar between the two strains. The results of this survey correlate closely with similar comparisons made at other laboratories, and with data compiled at our laboratories 10 years ago and published as a poster.

In the laboratory rat, differences in shape, dimension and function of the cochlea have been reported for various breeds. In contrast, no comparable investigations to date have been undertaken for the vestibular organ in different breeds of the rat. Vestibular organs of two breeds of rat (Wistar, Sprague-Dawley) were analyzed morphologically and morphometrically by means of microdissection techniques in order to determine the mechanical sensitivity of the cupula according to Oman et al; (Acta Otolaryngol., 1987;103:1-13, 1987). Differences in shape of the lateral semicircular duct exist between the two breeds and the cupular mechanical sensitivity is significantly higher in Wistar than in Sprague-Dawley rats. With respect to the other semicircular ducts, no differences in shape were found between the two strains. The cupular mechanical sensitivity of the anterior semicircular duct, however, is higher in Wistar than in Sprague-Dawley rats. The breeds also differ in the shape of their utriculus; obviously a correlation exists between the latter and the cupular mechanical sensitivity of the semicircular ducts. There are differences in the vestibular organs between the two breeds of the laboratory rat investigated. The cupular mechanical sensitivity of the semicircular duct does not seem to be correlated to body mass. The size and morphology of the utriculus influence the mechanical sensitivity of a single duct, but differences only become significant if other parameters also differ.

Developmental neurotoxicity (DNT) testing assesses potentially adverse effects on the developing nervous system. The present DNT study was conducted to generate historical data with the Wistar Han (WH) and Sprague Dawley (SD) rat strains, commonly used in Europe and the US, respectively. Potential differences between these strains in DNT endpoints have not been extensively investigated. Motor activity, startle response, learning and memory testing, and neurological (quantitative and qualitative) examinations were conducted using three groups of control, prenatally exposed (to Methylazoxymethanol [MAM] on gestation Day 15) and acutely treated (with IDPN, MK-801 or Chlorpromazine) animals for each strain. The positive controls produced clear effects in most endpoints investigated, with limited functional differences in baseline behavior and positive control sensitivity. However, SD rats were considerably more susceptible to MAM-induced learning and memory impairments and neurological damage. These data highlight differential sensitivity between the strains, which may require risk assessment consideration for developmental neurotoxicants.

A previous report of this work (Ringeissen et al. 2003) described the use of nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy coupled with multivariate statistical data analysis (MVDA) to identify novel biomarkers of peroxisome proliferation (PP) in Wistar Han rats. Two potential biomarkers of peroxisome proliferation in the rat were described, N-methylnicotinamide (NMN) and N-methyl-4-pyridone-3-carboxamide (4PY). The inference from these results was that the tryptophan-nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD(+)) pathway was altered in correlation with peroxisome proliferation, a hypothesis subsequently confirmed by TaqMan analysis of the relevant genes encoding two key enzymes in the pathway, aminocarboxymuconate-semialdehyde decarboxylase (EC 4.1.1.45) and quinolinate phosphoribosyltransferase (EC 2.4.2.19). The objective of the present study was to investigate these data further and identify other metabolites in the NMR spectrum correlating equally with PP. MVDA Partial Least Squares (PLS) models were constructed that provided a better prediction of PP in Wistar Han rats than levels of 4PY and NMN alone. The resulting Wistar Han rat predictive models were then used to predict PP in a test group of Sprague Dawley rats following administration of fenofibrate. The models predicted the presence or absence of PP (above on arbitrary threshold of >2-fold mean control) in all Sprague Dawley rats in the test group.

Knowledge of inter-strain and inter-gender differences in drug metabolism studies is important for animal selection in pharmacokinetic and toxicological studies. The effects of rat strain and gender in <i>in vitro</i> metabolism were investigated in Sprague Dawley (SD) and Wister Han (WH) rats based on the hepatocyte metabolic profiles of 14 small molecule drugs. Similarities were found between the hepatocyte metabolic clearances of SD and WH strains, suggesting that only one strain can be confidently used for the evaluation of hepatic clearance. Neither strain of rat was preferable over the other to cover human metabolites. Higher similarities in metabolic pathways were found between the same gender than the same strain. Differences in metabolite identities, metabolite formation rates and potential biotransformation pathways were observed between SD and WH rat strains. Eleven metabolites from six drugs were "disproportionally" formed between SD and WH rats. The use of a specific rat strain model and gender for ADME and toxicity testing should, therefore, be carefully considered as metabolic profiles may differ, even though metabolic clearance was similar between SD and WH rats.

NMR spectroscopic and statistical methods have been applied to investigate the biochemical variations within and between two phenotypically normal rat strains. The 600 MHz (1)H NMR spectra of urine were acquired as part of a series of drug toxicity studies from 450 control rat urine samples from each of two strains of laboratory rat (Han Wistar and Sprague Dawley). The spectra were data-reduced to 256 intensity descriptors over a range of delta 0.2-10.0. The spectral variation was analysed both within and between strains in terms of the mean, standard deviation, skewness and kurtosis of each descriptor. It is demonstrated that spectral intensities corresponding to a number of endogenous metabolites do not show Gaussian distributions and there is evidence for bimodality for some metabolites. Additionally, despite the visual similarity of the NMR spectra from the two strains of rat, the descriptor distributions and the statistics derived from them revealed differences in the metabolite profiles, which clearly distinguished the two populations. This work is of value in the determination of biochemical normality and variability, and thus can be used to investigate, and place confidence limits on the biochemical deviations, which arise as a consequence of genetic modification or pathophysiological events.

The purpose of the present study was to collect background data from repeated dose toxicity studies in Wistar Hannover [Crl:WI(Han)] (hereafter Wistar Han) rats with dosing periods of 4, 13 and 26 weeks from four safety research facilities of pharmaceutical companies and contract research organizations participating in the International Genetic Standardization (IGS) rat forum supported by Charles River Laboratories Japan, Inc. The data from Wistar Han rats were compared with those from Sprague Dawley Crl:CD(SD) rats. In addition, the effects of restricted feeding of SD rats were also investigated by one facility. As a result, body weights and food consumption in Wistar Han rats were lower than those of SD rats. White blood cell (WBC), neutrophil, lymphocyte, monocyte and eosinophil counts were almost half of those noted for SD rats and platelet counts were almost 20% less than those in SD rats. Minimal strain differences were noted in several biochemical parameters including aspartate aminotransferase (AST), alanine aminotransferase, total cholesterol, triglyceride and phospholipids, and in thymus, ovary and testis weights. Ophthalmologic or histopathologic examinations revealed a higher incidence of corneal opacities or corneal mineralization in Wistar Han rats. Restricted feeding of SD rats resulted in intermediate values for body weights and food consumption between the ad libitum fed SD and Wistar Han rats, and WBC and AST were lower than those in the ad libitum fed SD rats. Based on these results, some strain differences might be ascribable to reduced food consumption and associated body weight changes in Wistar Han rats.

The purpose of the present study was to collect the background data on Wistar Hannover [Crl:WI(Han)] (hereafter Wistar Han) rats in embryo-fetal development studies from the 6 safety research facilities of pharmaceutical companies and contract research organizations. In each facility, 20 or 22 female rats were dosed with vehicle solution during the organogenesis period. As a result, no abnormalities in clinical signs and necropsy findings in dams were found. Body weights and food consumption in dams were lower than those in Sprague Dawley (SD) rats. The number of corpora lutea (13.3 vs. 16.0 in SD) and implantations (11.8 vs. 14.7) were fewer, and fetal body weights (3.66 vs. 3.70) and placental weights (0.42 vs. 0.45) tended to be lower than those in SD rats. Regarding the fetal abnormalities, the incidence of several findings such as the persistent left umbilical artery (10.4% vs. 1.1%) and cervical (5.2% vs. 0.4%), full (7.4% vs. 0.9%) or short supernumerary (64.5% vs. 9.9%) and wavy ribs (6.6% vs. 0.3%) was higher than that in SD rats. Our present study showed that they maintained a sufficient number of live fetuses and the difference in the fetal sex ratio was not observed. In conclusion, Wistar Han rats were considered to be a suitable strain for embryo-fetal development toxicity study. Since the incidence of several abnormalities was higher than that in SD rats, it may be said that to accumulate background control data is important to evaluate the embryo-fetal development toxicity study using Wistar Han rats.

Many of the studies conducted to examine the developmental and reproductive toxicity potential of candidate pharmaceuticals use the Sprague-Dawley rat as the animal model. This is due in part to the large database for this outbred rat available for comparison of litter data, and the low incidence of fetal malformations and variations. The following study was conducted to generate information on potential embryo-fetal developmental defects and litter data in another outbred stock of rat, the Wistar Hannover. One hundred fifty pregnant female Wistar Hannover rats (Tac:Glx:WIfBR) were dosed orally once per day with distilled water from Gestation Days (GD) 6 through 17 covering the time from implantation to closure of the hard palate (GD0 = day of insemination). Caesarean sections were performed on Day 20 of gestation. All fetuses were examined for external, visceral and skeletal malformations and variations. Macroscopic and histomorphologic examinations were also completed for the F0 females at termination. The percent pregnant (88%) and litter size (average 10.6) were found to be lower than that commonly reported for the Sprague-Dawley rat (Crl:CD (SD)BR; 95.4% and 14.6, respectively). Pre-implantation loss (14.1%), post-implantation loss (7.4%) and percent resorptions (7.2%) occurred at a higher incidence than typically seen in the Sprague-Dawley rat (5.9, 5.6 and 5.1%, respectively). The average fetal body weights for both the female and male rats were lower than those typically seen in the Sprague-Dawley rat. External, visceral and skeletal examination of the F1 fetuses revealed numerous malformations and variations which also occurred at higher incidences than those reported for the Sprague-Dawley rat. Routine macroscopic and histomorphologic examination showed there were no changes that would be interpreted to have impaired mating performance, fertility or gestation. Thus, this study provides information on the reproductive effects and the background incidence of embryo-fetal development defects that could be used for comparison to those identified when using this outbred rat for developmental and reproductive toxicity studies, as well as for comparison to the more commonly used rat stock, the Sprague-Dawley rat. For the parameters evaluated, the Wistar Hannover rat had greater variability and an increased incidence of spontaneous malformations as compared to the Crl:CD (SD)BR Sprague-Dawley rat. These findings should be considered if this stock of rat is selected in the conduct of developmental and reproductive toxicity studies.
