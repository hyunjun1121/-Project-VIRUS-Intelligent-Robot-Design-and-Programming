IDEAL_ANSWER:
- Histone deacetylases influence diverse cellular processes and may contribute to tumor development and progression by multiple mechanisms. Histone deacetylases prevent the relaxation of chromatin, and positively or negatively regulate transcription. 
- Histone deacetylases (HDACs) prevent the relaxation of chromatin, and positively or negatively regulate transcription and thus cellular processes

EXACT_ANSWER:
- HDACs regulate chromatin structure and gene expression
