What is a HapMap

[PMID: 16877472]
With the availability of the HapMap--a resource which describes common patterns of linkage disequilibrium (LD) in four different human population samples, we now have a powerful tool to help dissect the role of genetic variation in the biology of the genome. HapMap is entirely complimentary to the human genome map and so it is particularly fitting that it should be viewed in a full genomic context. However, characterization of high resolution LD across the genome can be a challenging task, owing in part to the sheer volume of data and the inherent dimensionality that its analysis entails. However, a number of tools are now available to make this task easier for researchers. This review will examine tools for viewing and analysing haplotype and LD data, enabling a number of tasks; including identification of optimal sets of haplotype tagging single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs); drawing links between associated SNPs and putative causal alleles; or simply viewing LD and haplotypes across a gene or region of interest. The data generated by the HapMap also has other important applications, informing, for example, on the demographic history and evidence of selection in human populations and on previously undetected regulatory relationships and gene networks. All of these properties make the HapMap no less an important resource than the human genome sequence itself and so this makes it essential viewing for all in the field of human biology.

The HapMap project is a publicly available catalogue of common genetic variants that occur in humans, currently including several million SNPs across 1115 individuals spanning 11 different populations. This important database does not provide any programmatic access to the dataset, furthermore no standard relational database interface is provided. interPopula is a Python API to access the HapMap dataset. interPopula provides integration facilities with both the Python ecology of software (e.g. Biopython and matplotlib) and other relevant human population datasets (e.g. Ensembl gene annotation and UCSC Known Genes). A set of guidelines and code examples to address possible inconsistencies across heterogeneous data sources is also provided. interPopula is a straightforward and flexible Python API that facilitates the construction of scripts and applications that require access to the HapMap dataset.

The recent advancement in human genome sequencing and genotyping has revealed millions of single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNP) which determine the variation among human beings. One of the particular important projects is The International HapMap Project which provides the catalogue of human genetic variation for disease association studies. In this paper, we analyzed the genotype data in HapMap project by using National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences Environmental Genome Project (NIEHS EGP) SNPs. We first determine whether the HapMap data are transferable to the NIEHS data. Then, we study how well the HapMap SNPs capture the untyped SNPs in the region. Finally, we provide general guidelines for determining whether the SNPs chosen from HapMap may be able to capture most of the untyped SNPs. Our analysis shows that HapMap data are not robust enough to capture the untyped variants for most of the human genes. The performance of SNPs for European and Asian samples are marginal in capturing the untyped variants, i.e. approximately 55%. Expectedly, the SNPs from HapMap YRI panel can only capture approximately 30% of the variants. Although the overall performance is low, however, the SNPs for some genes perform very well and are able to capture most of the variants along the gene. This is observed in the European and Asian panel, but not in African panel. Through observation, we concluded that in order to have a well covered SNPs reference panel, the SNPs density and the association among reference SNPs are important to estimate the robustness of the chosen SNPs. We have analyzed the coverage of HapMap SNPs using NIEHS EGP data. The results show that HapMap SNPs are transferable to the NIEHS SNPs. However, HapMap SNPs cannot capture some of the untyped SNPs and therefore resequencing may be needed to uncover more SNPs in the missing region.

Advancements in our understanding of variation in the human genome and rapid improvements in high-throughput genotyping technology have made it feasible to study most of the human genetic diversity that is due to common variations in relation to observable phenotypes. Over the past few years, public SNP databases have matured and empirical genome-wide SNP data, such as that generated by the International HapMap Project, have shown the utility and efficiency of selecting and testing informative markers ("tag SNPs") that exploit redundancies among nearby polymorphisms due to linkage disequilibrium (LD). In this chapter, we will demonstrate how to use the HapMap resource and the Haploview program to process and analyze genetic data from HapMap, to evaluate LD relations between SNPs, and to select tagging SNPs to be examined in disease association studies.

Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) generate relationships between hundreds of thousands of single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and complex phenotypes. The contribution of the traditionally overlooked copy number variations (CNVs) to complex traits is also being actively studied. To facilitate the interpretation of the data and the designing of follow-up experimental validations, we have developed a database that enables the sensible prioritization of these variants by combining several approaches, involving not only publicly available physical and functional annotations but also multilocus linkage disequilibrium (LD) annotations as well as annotations of expression quantitative trait loci (eQTLs). For each SNP, the SCAN database provides: (i) summary information from eQTL mapping of HapMap SNPs to gene expression (evaluated by the Affymetrix exon array) in the full set of HapMap CEU (Caucasians from UT, USA) and YRI (Yoruba people from Ibadan, Nigeria) samples; (ii) LD information, in the case of a HapMap SNP, including what genes have variation in strong LD (pairwise or multilocus LD) with the variant and how well the SNP is covered by different high-throughput platforms; (iii) summary information available from public databases (e.g. physical and functional annotations); and (iv) summary information from other GWAS. For each gene, SCAN provides annotations on: (i) eQTLs for the gene (both local and distant SNPs) and (ii) the coverage of all variants in the HapMap at that gene on each high-throughput platform. For each genomic region, SCAN provides annotations on: (i) physical and functional annotations of all SNPs, genes and known CNVs within the region and (ii) all genes regulated by the eQTLs within the region. http://www.scandb.org. Supplementary data are available at Bioinformatics online.

The rapidly growing amount of genomic sequence data being generated and made publicly available necessitate the development of new data storage and archiving methods. The vast amount of data being shared and manipulated also create new challenges for network resources. Thus, developing advanced data compression techniques is becoming an integral part of data production and analysis. The HapMap project is one of the largest public resources of human single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), characterizing over 3 million SNPs genotyped in over 1000 individuals. The standard format and biological properties of HapMap data suggest that a dedicated genetic compression method can outperform generic compression tools. We propose a compression methodology for genetic data by introducing HapZipper, a lossless compression tool tailored to compress HapMap data beyond benchmarks defined by generic tools such as gzip, bzip2 and lzma. We demonstrate the usefulness of HapZipper by compressing HapMap 3 populations to <5% of their original sizes. HapZipper is freely downloadable from https://bitbucket.org/pchanda/hapzipper/downloads/HapZipper.tar.bz2.

We describe the Phase II HapMap, which characterizes over 3.1 million human single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) genotyped in 270 individuals from four geographically diverse populations and includes 25-35% of common SNP variation in the populations surveyed. The map is estimated to capture untyped common variation with an average maximum r2 of between 0.9 and 0.96 depending on population. We demonstrate that the current generation of commercial genome-wide genotyping products captures common Phase II SNPs with an average maximum r2 of up to 0.8 in African and up to 0.95 in non-African populations, and that potential gains in power in association studies can be obtained through imputation. These data also reveal novel aspects of the structure of linkage disequilibrium. We show that 10-30% of pairs of individuals within a population share at least one region of extended genetic identity arising from recent ancestry and that up to 1% of all common variants are untaggable, primarily because they lie within recombination hotspots. We show that recombination rates vary systematically around genes and between genes of different function. Finally, we demonstrate increased differentiation at non-synonymous, compared to synonymous, SNPs, resulting from systematic differences in the strength or efficacy of natural selection between populations.

Understanding of linkage disequilibrium (LD) in human populations could facilitate the discovery of genes that influence complex human diseases. The "HapMap" project is now underway to characterize patterns of LD in the human genome. A pilot study showed "haplotype blocks" in 51 regions scattered throughout the genome. These intriguing results raise important questions about the nature of recombination, and highlight practical issues of marker collection, the influence of statistical modelling on apparent block structure, and the levels of genotyping necessary for studies of common diseases. Knowledge of local disequilibrium patterns may help identify common polymorphisms involved in complex disease, but completely new analytical methods and experimental designs will be required to identify important rare variants.

The International Haplotype Map Project (HapMap) has provided an essential database for studies of human population genetics and genome-wide association. Phases I and II of the HapMap project generated genotype data across ∼3 million SNP loci in 270 individuals representing four populations. Phase III provides dense genotype data on ∼1.5 million SNPs, generated by Illumina and Affymetrix platforms in a larger set of individuals. Release 3 of phase III of the HapMap contains 1397 individuals from 11 populations, including 250 of the original 270 phase I and phase II individuals and 1147 additional individuals. Although some known relationships among the phase III individuals have been described in the data release, the genotype data that are currently available provide an opportunity to empirically ascertain previously unknown relationships. We performed a systematic analysis of genetic relatedness and were able not only to confirm the reported relationships, but also to detect numerous additional, previously unidentified pairs of close relatives in the HapMap sample. The inferred relative pairs make it possible to propose standardized subsets of unrelated individuals for use in future studies in which relatedness needs to be clearly defined.

In genome-wide association studies, only a subset of all genomic variants are typed by current, high-throughput, SNP-genotyping platforms. However, many of the untyped variants can be well predicted from typed variants, with linkage disequilibrium (LD) information among typed and untyped variants available from an external reference panel such as HapMap. Incorporation of such external information can allow one to perform tests of association between untyped variants and phenotype, thereby making more efficient use of the available genotype data. When related individuals are included in case-control samples, the dependence among their genotypes must be properly addressed for valid association testing. In the context of testing untyped variants, an additional analytical challenge is that the dependence, across related individuals, of the partial information on untyped-SNP genotypes must also be assessed and incorporated into the analysis for valid inference. We address this challenge with ATRIUM, a method for case-control association testing with untyped SNPs, based on genome screen data in samples in which some individuals are related. ATRIUM uses LD information from an external reference panel to specify a one-degree-of-freedom test of association with an untyped SNP. It properly accounts for dependence in the partial information on untyped-SNP genotypes across related individuals. We demonstrate that ATRIUM is robust in that it maintains the nominal type I error rate even when the external reference panel is not well matched to the case-control sample. We apply the method to detect association between type 2 diabetes and variants on chromosome 10 in the Framingham SHARe data.

HapMap provides linkage disequilibrium (LD) information on a sample of 3.7 million SNPs that can be used for tag SNP selection in whole-genome association studies. HapMap can also be used for tag SNP selection in candidate genes, although its performance has yet to be evaluated against gene resequencing data, where there is near-complete SNP ascertainment. The Environmental Genome Project (EGP) is the largest gene resequencing effort to date with over 500 resequenced genes. We used HapMap data to select tag SNPs and calculated the proportions of common SNPs (MAF>or=0.05) tagged (rho2>or=0.8) for each of 127 EGP Panel 2 genes where individual ethnic information was available. Median gene-tagging proportions are 50, 80 and 74% for African, Asian, and European groups, respectively. These low gene-tagging proportions may be problematic for some candidate gene studies. In addition, although HapMap targeted nonsynonymous SNPs (nsSNPs), we estimate only approximately 30% of nonsynonymous SNPs in EGP are in high LD with any HapMap SNP. We show that gene-tagging proportions can be improved by adding a relatively small number of tag SNPs that were selected based on resequencing data. We also demonstrate that ethnic-mixed data can be used to improve HapMap gene-tagging proportions, but are not as efficient as ethnic-specific data. Finally, we generalized the greedy algorithm proposed by Carlson et al (2004) to select tag SNPs for multiple populations and implemented the algorithm into a freely available software package mPopTag.

One of the goals of the International HapMap Project is the identification of common haplotypes in genes. However, HapMap uses an incomplete catalogue of single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and might miss some common haplotypes. We examined this issue using data from the Environmental Genome Project (EGP) which resequenced 335 genes in 90 people, and thus, has a nearly complete catalogue of gene SNPs. The EGP identified a total of 45,243 SNPs, of which 10,780 were common SNPs (minor allele frequency >or=0.1). Using EGP common SNP genotype data, we identified 1,459 haplotypes with frequency >or=0.05 and we use these as "benchmark" haplotypes. HapMap release 16 had genotype information for 1,573 of 10,780 (15%) EGP common SNPs. Using these SNPs, we identified common HapMap haplotypes (frequency >or=0.05) in each of the four HapMap ethnic groups. To compare common HapMap haplotypes to EGP benchmark haplotypes, we collapsed benchmark haplotypes to the set of 1,573 SNPs. Ninety-eight percent of the collapsed benchmark haplotypes could be found as common HapMap haplotypes in one or more of the four HapMap ethnic groups. However, collapsing benchmark haplotypes to the set of SNPs available in HapMap resulted in a loss of haplotype information: 545 of 1,459 (37%) benchmark haplotypes were uniquely identified, and only 25% of genes had all their benchmark haplotypes uniquely identified. We resampled the EGP data to examine the effect of increasing the number of HapMap SNPs to 5 million, and estimate that approximately 40% of common SNPs in genes will be sampled and that half of the genes will have sufficient SNPs to identify all common haplotypes. This inability to distinguish common haplotypes of genes may result in loss of power when examining haplotype-disease association.

The pattern and nature of linkage disequilibrium in the human genome is being studied and catalogued as part of the International HapMap Project [:2003 Nature 426:789-796]. A key goal of the HapMap Project is to enable identification of tag single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) that capture a substantial portion of common human genetic variability while requiring only a small fraction of SNPs to be genotyped [International HapMap Consortium, 2005: Nature 437:1299-1320]. In the current study, we examined the effectiveness of using the CEU HapMap database to select tag SNPs for a Finnish sample. We selected SNPs in a 17.9-Mb region of chromosome 14 based on pairwise linkage disequilibrium (r(2)) estimates from the HapMap CEU sample, and genotyped 956 of these SNPs in 1,425 Finnish individuals. An excess of SNPs showed significantly different allele frequencies between the HapMap CEU and the Finnish samples, consistent with population-specific differences. However, we observed strong correlations between the two samples for estimates of allele frequencies, r(2) values, and haplotype frequencies. Our results demonstrate that the HapMap CEU samples provide an adequate basis for tag SNP selection in Finnish individuals, without the need to create a map specifically for the Finnish population, and suggest that the four-population HapMap data will provide useful information for tag SNP selection beyond the specific populations from which they were sampled.

DTNBP1 was first identified as a putative schizophrenia-susceptibility gene in Irish pedigrees, with a report of association to common genetic variation. Several replication studies have reported confirmation of an association to DTNBP1 in independent European samples; however, reported risk alleles and haplotypes appear to differ between studies, and comparison among studies has been confounded because different marker sets were employed by each group. To facilitate evaluation of existing evidence of association and further work, we supplemented the extensive genotype data, available through the International HapMap Project (HapMap), about DTNBP1 by specifically typing all associated single-nucleotide polymorphisms reported in each of the studies of the Centre d'Etude du Polymorphisme Humain (CEPH)-derived HapMap sample (CEU). Using this high-density reference map, we compared the putative disease-associated haplotype from each study and found that the association studies are inconsistent with regard to the identity of the disease-associated haplotype at DTNBP1. Specifically, all five "replication" studies define a positively associated haplotype that is different from the association originally reported. We further demonstrate that, in all six studies, the European-derived populations studied have haplotype patterns and frequencies that are consistent with HapMap CEU samples (and each other). Thus, it is unlikely that population differences are creating the inconsistency of the association studies. Evidence of association is, at present, equivocal and unsatisfactory. The new dense map of the region may be valuable in more-comprehensive follow-up studies.

INTRODUCTIONThe primary goal of the International Haplotype Map Project has been to develop a haplotype map of the human genome that describes the common patterns of genetic variation, in order to accelerate the search for the genetic causes of human disease. Within the project, ~3.9 million distinct single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) have been genotyped in 270 individuals from four worldwide populations. The project data are available for unrestricted public use at the HapMap website. This site, which is the primary portal to genotype data produced by the project, offers bulk downloads of the data set, as well as interactive data browsing and analysis tools that are not available elsewhere. Research into the genetic contributions to a human disease commonly focuses on candidate genes identified from linkage and/or association studies, as well as from pathways suspected to be involved in a particular disease process. In studying candidate genes, a researcher will want to know whether there are any common SNPs in the immediate vicinity, what those SNPs' alleles are, and the relative frequencies of the alleles in the population. The researcher will also be particularly interested in coding SNPs, whose alleles change the amino acid sequence of the gene product and therefore might represent functional variations. This protocol provides details on how to use the genome browser to navigate to and explore HapMap data for a gene or region of interest.

The goal of the International HapMap Project is to determine the common patterns of DNA sequence variation in the human genome and to make this information freely available in the public domain. An international consortium is developing a map of these patterns across the genome by determining the genotypes of one million or more sequence variants, their frequencies and the degree of association between them, in DNA samples from populations with ancestry from parts of Africa, Asia and Europe. The HapMap will allow the discovery of sequence variants that affect common disease, will facilitate development of diagnostic tools, and will enhance our ability to choose targets for therapeutic intervention.

The approach to epilepsy care has transformed in the last 30 years, with more and better anti-epileptic medications, improved cerebral imaging and increased surgical options. Alongside this, developments in neuroscience and molecular genetics have furthered the understanding of epileptogenesis. Future developments in pharmacogenomics hold the promise of antiepileptic drugs matched to specific genotypes. Despite this rapid progress, one-third of epilepsy patients remain refractory to medication, with their seizures impacting upon day-to-day activity, social well-being, independence, economic output and quality of life. International genome collaborations, such as HapMap and the Welcome Trust Case-Control Consortium single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) mapping project have identified common genetic variations in diseases of major public health importance. Such genetic signposts should help to identify at-risk populations with a view to producing more effective pharmaceutical treatments. Neurological disorders, despite comprising one-fifth of UK acute medical hospital admissions, are surprisingly under-represented in these projects. Epilepsy is the commonest serious neurological disorder worldwide. Although physically, psychologically, socially and financially disabling, it rarely receives deserved attention from physicians, scientists and governmental bodies. As outlined in this article, research into epilepsy genetics presents unique challenges. These help to explain why the identification of its complex genetic traits has lagged well behind other disciplines, particularly the efforts made in neuropsychiatric disorders. Clinical beginnings must underpin any genetic understanding in epilepsy. Success in identifying genetic traits in other disorders does not make the automatic case for genome-wide screening in epilepsy, but such is a desired goal. The essential clinical approach of accurately phenotyping, diagnosing and interpreting the dynamic nature of epilepsy remains fundamental to harvesting its potential translational outcomes.

Determining the patterns of DNA sequence variation in the human genome is a useful first step toward identifying the genetic basis of a common disease. A haplotype map (HapMap), aimed at describing these variation patterns across the entire genome, has been recently developed by the International HapMap Consortium. In this article, we present a novel statistical model for directly characterizing specific sequence variants that are responsible for disease risk based on the haplotype structure provided by HapMap. Our model is developed in the maximum-likelihood context, implemented with the EM algorithm. We perform simulation studies to investigate the statistical properties of this disease-sequencing model. A worked example from a human obesity study with 155 patients was used to validate this model. In this example, we found that patients carrying a haplotype constituted by allele Gly16 at codon 16 and allele Gln27 at codon 27 genotyped within the beta2AR candidate gene display significantly lower body mass index than patients carrying the other haplotypes. The implications and extensions of our model are discussed.

Advances in high-throughput genotyping and the International HapMap Project have enabled association studies at the whole-genome level. We have constructed whole-genome genotyping panels of over 550,000 (HumanHap550) and 650,000 (HumanHap650Y) SNP loci by choosing tag SNPs from all populations genotyped by the International HapMap Project. These panels also contain additional SNP content in regions that have historically been overrepresented in diseases, such as nonsynonymous sites, the MHC region, copy number variant regions and mitochondrial DNA. We estimate that the tag SNP loci in these panels cover the majority of all common variation in the genome as measured by coverage of both all common HapMap SNPs and an independent set of SNPs derived from complete resequencing of genes obtained from SeattleSNPs. We also estimate that, given a sample size of 1,000 cases and 1,000 controls, these panels have the power to detect single disease loci of moderate risk (lambda approximately 1.8-2.0). Relative risks as low as lambda approximately 1.1-1.3 can be detected using 10,000 cases and 10,000 controls depending on the sample population and disease model. If multiple loci are involved, the power increases significantly to detect at least one locus such that relative risks 20%-35% lower can be detected with 80% power if between two and four independent loci are involved. Although our SNP selection was based on HapMap data, which is a subset of all common SNPs, these panels effectively capture the majority of all common variation and provide high power to detect risk alleles that are not represented in the HapMap data.

Since publication of the human genome in 2003, geneticists have been interested in risk variant associations to resolve the etiology of traits and complex diseases. The International HapMap Consortium undertook an effort to catalog all common variation across the genome (variants with a minor allele frequency (MAF) of at least 5% in one or more ethnic groups). HapMap along with advances in genotyping technology led to genome-wide association studies which have identified common variants associated with many traits and diseases. In 2008 the 1000 Genomes Project aimed to sequence 2500 individuals and identify rare variants and 99% of variants with a MAF of <1%. To determine whether the 1000 Genomes Project includes all the variants in HapMap, we examined the overlap between single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) genotyped in the two resources using merged phase II/III HapMap data and low coverage pilot data from 1000 Genomes. Comparison of the two data sets showed that approximately 72% of HapMap SNPs were also found in 1000 Genomes Project pilot data. After filtering out HapMap variants with a MAF of <5% (separately for each population), 99% of HapMap SNPs were found in 1000 Genomes data. Not all variants cataloged in HapMap are also cataloged in 1000 Genomes. This could affect decisions about which resource to use for SNP queries, rare variant validation, or imputation. Both the HapMap and 1000 Genomes Project databases are useful resources for human genetics, but it is important to understand the assumptions made and filtering strategies employed by these projects.

Genomic medicine is simply the routine use of genomic analysis, preferably by direct DNA studies, to improve the quality of medical care. A likely consequence will be to increase the predictive and prevention capacities of medicine, including common diseases, such as cancer, diabetes and others. The most common variability of the genome are the SNPs (single nucleotide polymorphisms), every person having between 3 and 10 million of them. SNPs may or not be harmless, and studies are in progress in cases and controls studies to answer the question of whether they determine why some persons have a given disease and others do not, and if they have something to do with that the individual variation in the response to drugs. We discuss in the same context the haplotype map project (HapMap) as a tool to facilitate the study of possible associations of genome changes and common diseases. We discuss the most successful effort in gene therapy, that of severe combined immunodeficiency, in which 17 out of 18 patients responded well to the procedure, although 2 of them developed late side effects in the form of acute leukemia, very likely related to the therapy. The ethical social and legal problems of genomic medicine are discussed very lightly and several references are given to readers interested in this matter.
