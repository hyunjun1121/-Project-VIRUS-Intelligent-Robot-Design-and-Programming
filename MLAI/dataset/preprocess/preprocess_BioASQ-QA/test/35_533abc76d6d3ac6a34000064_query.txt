The molecular mechanisms that regulate the age-induced increase of p16(INK4a) expression associated with decreased beta-cell proliferation and regeneration are not well understood. We report that in aged islets, derepression of the Ink4a/Arf locus is associated with decreased Bmi-1 binding, loss of H2A ubiquitylation, increased MLL1 recruitment, and a concomitant increase in H3K4 trimethylation. During beta-cell regeneration these histone modifications are reversed resulting in reduced p16(INK4a) expression and increased proliferation. We suggest that PcG and TrxG proteins impart a combinatorial code of histone modifications on the Ink4a/Arf locus to control beta-cell proliferation during aging and regeneration.

Androgenetic alopecia (AGA), a hereditary disorder that involves the progressive thinning of hair in a defined pattern, is driven by androgens. The hair follicle dermal papilla (DP) expresses androgen receptors (AR) and plays an important role in the control of normal hair growth. In AGA, it has been proposed that the inhibitory actions of androgens are mediated via the DP although the molecular nature of these interactions is poorly understood. To investigate mechanisms of AGA, we cultured DP cells (DPC) from balding and non-balding scalp and confirmed previous reports that balding DPC grow slower in vitro than non-balding DPC. Loss of proliferative capacity of balding DPC was associated with changes in cell morphology, expression of senescence-associated beta-galactosidase, as well as decreased expression of proliferating cell nuclear antigen and Bmi-1; upregulation of p16(INK4a)/pRb and nuclear expression of markers of oxidative stress and DNA damage including heat shock protein-27, super oxide dismutase catalase, ataxia-telangiectasia-mutated kinase (ATM), and ATM- and Rad3-related protein. Premature senescence of balding DPC in vitro in association with expression of p16(INK4a)/pRB suggests that balding DPC are sensitive to environmental stress and identifies alternative pathways that could lead to novel therapeutic strategies for treatment of AGA.

Thymocytes undergo massive proliferation before T cell receptor (TCR) gene rearrangement, ensuring the diversification of the TCR repertoire. Because activated cells are more susceptible to damage, cell-death restraint as well as promotion of cell-cycle progression is considered important for adequate cell growth. Although the molecular mechanism of pre-TCR-induced proliferation has been examined, the mechanisms of protection against cell death during the proliferation phase remain unknown. Here we show that the survival of activated pre-T cells induced by pre-TCR signaling required the Polycomb group (PcG) gene product Bmi-1-mediated repression of Cdkn2A, and that p19Arf expression resulted in thymocyte cell death and inhibited the transition from CD4(-)CD8(-) (DN) to CD4(+)CD8(+) (DP) stage upstream of the transcriptional factor p53 pathway. The expression of Cdkn2A (the gene encoding p19Arf) in immature thymocytes was directly regulated by PcG complex containing Bmi-1 and M33 through the maintenance of local trimethylated histone H3K27. Our results indicate that this epigenetic regulation critically contributes to the survival of the activated pre-T cells, thereby supporting their proliferation during the DN-DP transition.

In response to hyperproliferative signaling elicited by transforming oncogenes some normal human cells can enter replicative senescence as a tumor defense mechanism. We recently found that human fibroblasts or endothelial cells with genetically-engineered reduction of proto-oncogene c-Myc expression switched with an increased frequency to a senescent state by a telomere-independent mechanism involving the polycomb group repressor Bmi-1 and the cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor p16(INK4a). The same regulatory circuit was triggered upon exposure to mild oxidative stress. These findings point to the existence of a mechanism for monitoring hypoproliferative signaling, whose function may be to limit the proliferation and accretion of physiologically compromised cells. This mechanism may be another example of antagonistic pleiotropy leading to organismal aging.

Self-renewing divisions of normal and cancerous stem cells are responsible for the initiation and maintenance of normal and certain cancerous tissues, respectively. Recent findings suggest that tumor surveillance mechanisms can reduce regenerative capacity and frequency of normal stem cells, thereby contributing to tissue aging. Signaling pathways promoting self-renewal of stem cells can also drive proliferation in cancer. The BMI-1 proto-oncogene is required for the maintenance of tissue-specific stem cells and is involved in carcinogenesis within the same tissues. BMI-1 promotes self-renewal of stem cells largely by interfering with two central cellular tumor suppressor pathways, p16(Ink4a)/retinoblastoma protein (Rb) and ARF/p53, whose disruption is a hallmark of cancer. Nucleolin, an Rb-associated protein, is abundant in proliferating cancerous cells and likely contributes to the maintenance of human CD34-positive stem/progenitor cells of hematopoiesis. Elucidation of the involvement of proto-oncogenes and tumor suppressors in the maintenance of stem cells might have therapeutic implications.

Dental mesenchymal stem cells (dMSCs) might differentiate into odontoblast-like cells and form mineralized nodules. In the current study, we investigated the effects of senescence on odontogenic differentiation of dMSCs. dMSCs were serially subcultured until senescence. Telomere lengths and telomerase activities were determined by quantitative polymerase chain reaction. Expression of genes involved in cell proliferation and differentiation, eg, Bmi-1, p16(INK4A), osteocalcin (OC), dentin sialoprotein (DSP), bone sialoprotein (BSP), and dentin matrix protein-1 (DMP-1) were assayed by Western blotting and quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction. Exogenous Bmi-1 was expressed in dMSCs by using retroviral vectors. Odontogenic differentiation was assayed by alkaline phosphatase activity. Subculture-induced replicative senescence of dMSCs led to reduced expression of Bmi-1, OC, DSP, and BSP compared with rapidly proliferating cells, whereas p16(INK4A) level increased. The cells exhibited progressive loss of telomeric DNA during subculture, presumably as a result of lack of telomerase activity. Bmi-1 transduction did not affect proliferation of cells but enhanced the expression of OC and DSP in the late passage cultures. Bmi-1-transduced cells also demonstrated enhanced alkaline phosphatase activity and mineralized nodule formation. These results indicate that dMSCs lose their odontogenic differentiation potential during senescence, in part by reduced Bmi-1 expression.

The gene that encodes the ATM protein kinase is mutated in ataxia-telangiectasia (A-T). One of the prominent features of A-T is progressive neurodegeneration. We have previously reported that primary astrocytes isolated from Atm(-/-) mice grow slowly and die earlier than control cells in culture. However, the mechanisms for this remain unclear. We show here that intrinsic elevated intracellular levels of reactive oxygen species (ROS) are associated with the senescence-like growth defect of Atm(-/-) astrocytes. This condition is accompanied by constitutively higher levels of ERK1/2 phosphorylation and p16(Ink4a) in Atm(-/-) astrocytes. We also observe that ROS-induced up-regulation of p16(Ink4a) occurs correlatively with ERK1/2-dependent down-regulation and subsequent dissociation from chromatin of Bmi-1. Furthermore, both mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK)/ERK inhibitor PD98059 and antioxidant N-acetyl-l-cysteine restored normal proliferation of Atm(-/-) astrocytes. These results suggest that ATM is required for normal astrocyte growth through its ability to stabilize intracellular redox status and that the inability to control ROS is the molecular basis of limited cell growth of Atm(-/-) astrocytes. This defect may be mediated by a mechanism involving ERK1/2 activation and Bmi-1 derepression of p16(Ink4a). These data identify new potential targets for therapeutic intervention in A-T neurodegeneration.

The bmi-1 gene was first isolated as an oncogene that cooperates with c-myc in the generation of mouse lymphomas. We subsequently identified Bmi-1 as a transcriptional repressor belonging to the mouse Polycomb group. The Polycomb group comprises an important, conserved set of proteins that are required to maintain stable repression of specific target genes, such as homeobox-cluster genes, during development. In mice, the absence of bmi-1 expression results in neurological defects and severe proliferative defects in lymphoid cells, whereas bmi-1 overexpression induces lymphomas. Here we show that bmi-1-deficient primary mouse embryonic fibroblasts are impaired in progression into the S phase of the cell cycle and undergo premature senescence. In these fibroblasts and in bmi-1-deficient lymphocytes, the expression of the tumour suppressors p16 and p19Arf, which are encoded by ink4a, is raised markedly. Conversely, overexpression of bmi-1 allows fibroblast immortalization, downregulates expression of p16 and p19Arf and, in combination with H-ras, leads to neoplastic transformation. Removal of ink4a dramatically reduces the lymphoid and neurological defects seen in bmi-1-deficient mice, indicating that ink4a is a critical in vivo target for Bmi-1. Our results connect transcriptional repression by Polycomb-group proteins with cell-cycle control and senescence.

Genes of the polycomb group function by silencing homeotic selector genes that regulate embryogenesis. In mice, downregulation of one of the polycomb genes, bmi-1, leads to neurological alterations and severe proliferative defects in lymphoid cells, whilst bmi-1 overexpression, together with upregulation of myc-1, induces lymphoma. An oncogenic function has been further supported in primary fibroblast studies where bmi-1 overexpression induces immortalization due to repression of p16/p19ARF, and where together with H-ras, it readily transforms MEFs. It was the aim of this study to assess the expression of bmi-1 in resectable non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) in association with p16 and p14ARF (=human p19ARF). Tumours (48 resectable NSCLC (32 squamous, 9 adeno-, 2 large cell, 4 undifferentiated carcinomas and 1 carcinoid); stage I, 29, II, 7, III, 12; T1, 18, T2, 30; differentiation: G1 12, G2 19, G3 17) were studied by immunohistochemistry for protein expression and by comparative multiplex PCR for gene amplification analysis. In tumour-free, normal lung tissue from patients, weak - moderate bmi-1 staining was seen in some epithelial cells, lymphocytes, glandular cells and in fibroblasts, whereas blood, endothelial, chondrocytes, muscle cells and adipocytes did not exhibit any bmi-1 expression. In tumours, malignant cells were negative/weakly, moderately and strongly positive in 20, 22 and 6 cases, respectively. As assessed by multiplex PCR, bmi-1 gene amplification was not the reason for high-level bmi-1 expression. Tumours with moderate or strong bmi-1 expression were more likely to have low levels of p16 and p14ARF (P = 0.02). Similarly, tumours negative for both, p16 and p14ARF, exhibit moderate-strong bmi-1 staining. 58% of resectable NSCLC exhibit moderate-high levels of bmi-1 protein. The inverse correlation of bmi-1 and the INK4 locus proteins expression (p16/p14ARF) supports a possible role for bmi-1 misregulation in lung carcinogenesis.

It is generally assumed that squamous cell carcinoma develops in a stepwise manner from normal bronchial epithelium towards cancer by the accumulation of (epi)genetic alterations. Several mechanisms including mutations and homozygous deletions or hypermethylation of the p16(INK4a) promoter region can cause loss of p16 expression. Recent studies suggest overexpression of the polycomb-group gene BMI-1 might also down-regulate p16 expression. In this study, we analyzed the p16 expression in relation to the methylation status of the p16 promoter region of the p16(INK4a) gene and the expression of BMI-1 in bronchial squamous cell carcinomas (SCC) and its premalignant lesions. Nine (69%) SCC showed loss of p16 expression and 10 (77%) showed expression of BMI-1. Of four p16 positive samples two (50%) were BMI-1 positive, whereas among nine p16 negative samples, eight (89%) revealed BMI-1 staining. Four (44%) p16 negative samples were hypermethylated at the p16(INK4a) promoter region; the other p16 negative tumors that showed no hypermethylation revealed BMI-1 staining. Only two premalignant lesions showed absence of p16 expression, of which one (carcinoma in situ) was hypermethylated at the p16(INK4a) promoter region and the other (severe dysplasia) showed BMI-1 expression. In total, 11 precursor lesions (48%) revealed BMI-1 expression. In conclusion, the results of this study suggest that loss of p16 expression by promoter hypermethylation is inconsistently and occurs late in the carcinogenic process at the level of severe dysplasia. To what extent overexpression of the polycomb-group protein BMI-1 attributes to down regulating of p16 expression remains unclear.

Bmi-1, the first functionally identified polycomb gene family member, plays critical roles in cell cycle regulation, cell immortalization, and cell senescence. Bmi-1 is involved in the development and progression of carcinomas and is a potent target for cancer therapy. One important pathway regulated by Bmi-1 is that involving two cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitors, p16(Ink4a) and p19(Arf), as Bmi-1 represses the INK4a locus on which they are encoded. A close correlation between the up-regulation of Bmi-1 and down-regulation of p16 has been demonstrated in various tumors; however, how Bmi-1 regulates p16 expression is not clear. In this study, we revealed that Bmi-1 regulates the expression of p16 by binding directly to the Bmi-1-responding element (BRE) within the p16 promoter. The BRE resided at bp -821 to -732 upstream of the p16 ATG codon. BRE alone was sufficient to allow Bmi-1-mediated regulation of the CMV promoter. Bmi-1 typically functions by forming a complex with Ring2; however, regulation of p16 was independent of Ring2. Chromatin immunoprecipitation sequencing of Bmi-1-precipitated chromatin DNA revealed that 1536 genes were targeted by Bmi-1, including genes involved in tissue-specific differentiation, cell cycle, and apoptosis. By analyzing the binding sequences of these genes, we found two highly conserved Bmi-1-binding motifs, which were required for Bmi-1-mediated p16 promoter regulation. Taken together, our results revealed the molecular mechanism of Bmi-1-mediated regulation of the p16 gene, thus providing further insights into the functions of Bmi-1 as well as a sensitive high-throughput platform with which to screen Bmi-1-targeted small molecules for cancer therapy.

Knockout studies have shown that the polycomb gene Bmi-1 is important for postnatal, but not embryonic, neural stem cell (NSC) self-renewal and have identified the cell-cycle inhibitors p16/p19 as molecular targets. Here, using lentiviral-delivered shRNAs in vitro and in vivo, we determined that Bmi-1 is also important for NSC self-renewal in the embryo. We found that neural progenitors depend increasingly on Bmi-1 for proliferation as development proceeds from embryonic through adult stages. Acute shRNA-mediated Bmi-1 reduction causes defects in embryonic and adult NSC proliferation and self-renewal that, unexpectedly, are mediated by a different cell-cycle inhibitor, p21. Gene array analyses revealed developmental differences in Bmi-1-controlled expression of genes in the p21-Rb cell cycle regulatory pathway. Our data therefore implicate p21 as an important Bmi-1 target in NSCs, potentially with stage-related differences. Understanding stage-related mechanisms underlying NSC self-renewal has important implications for development of stem cell-based therapies.

The human oncogene B-cell-specific Moloney murine leukemia virus integration site 1 (BMI-1) is a member of the mammalian Polycomb group family. The overexpression of BMI-1 is associated with human malignancies. In this study, the effects of knockdown of BMI-1 by shRNA-mediated RNA interference on cell cycle and possible downstream targets in human cervical adenocarcinoma HeLa cells were investigated. As a result, when the shRNA plasmid was stably introduced into the cell line, the mRNA and protein of BMI-1 were specifically down-regulated, and the cells increased in the phase of G1 and cells in S phase significantly decreased by flow cytometric analysis; the knockdown of BMI-1 expression could lead to significant up-regulation of p16INK4a, HOXA9 and HOXC13 mRNA expression, but hTERT and HOXB4 mRNA expression did not change significantly. In conclusion, RNAi-mediated knockdown of BMI-1 expression can induce cell-cycle arrest and up-regulate p16INK4a, HOXA9 and HOXC13 in HeLa cells. Our results suggest that targeting BMI-1 might be a therapeutic potential for the treatment of cancer.

Recent studies provided strong support for the view that ubiquitin-specific protease 22 (USP22) plays a central role in cell-cycle progression and also in pathological processes such as oncogenesis. We have recently shown that USP22 levels are elevated in colorectal carcinoma with associated increase in the expression of several cell-cycle-related genes. However, the precise mechanism for these functions of USP22 at molecular level has not been fully elucidated. Currently, we investigated the role of USP22 in human colorectal cancer (CRC). We observed that USP22 expression was statistically significantly correlated positively with that of BMI-1, c-Myc and both, pAkt (Ser473), and pAkt (Thr308), in primary tumor tissues from 43 CRC patients. Down-regulation of USP22 expression in HCT116 colorectal cancer cells by siRNA resulted in the accumulation of cells in the G1 phase of the cell cycle. RNAi-knockdown of USP22 in HCT16 cells also led to the repression of BMI-1 and was accompanied by the up-regulation of p16INK4a and p14ARF, with a consequent decrease in E2F1 and p53 levels. In addition, down-regulation of c-Myc-targeted cyclin D2 was also noticed in cells treated with USP22-siRNA. Furthermore, our results showed that USP22 deletion also caused down-regulation of Akt/GSK3β activity, which can also contribute to the reduction of cyclin D2. Collectively, our current results suggest that USP22 may act as an oncogene in CRC as it positively regulates cell cycle via both BMI-1-mediated INK4a/ARF pathway and Akt signaling pathway.

Networks of proto-oncogenes and tumor suppressors that control cancer cell proliferation also regulate stem cell self-renewal and possibly stem cell aging. Proto-oncogenes promote regenerative capacity by promoting stem cell function but must be balanced with tumor suppressor activity to avoid neoplastic proliferation. Conversely, tumor suppressors inhibit regenerative capacity by promoting cell death or senescence in stem cells. For example, the polycomb family proto-oncogene, Bmi-1, is consistently required for the self-renewal of diverse adult stem cells, as well as for the proliferation of cancer cells in the same tissues. Bmi-1 promotes stem cell self-renewal partly by repressing the expression of Ink4a and Arf, tumor suppressor genes that are commonly deleted in cancer. Despite ongoing Bmi-1 expression, Ink4a expression increases with age, potentially reducing stem cell frequency and function. Increased tumor suppressor activity during aging therefore may partly account for age-related declines in stem cell function. Thus, networks of proto-oncogenes and tumor suppressors have evolved to coordinately regulate stem cell function throughout life. Imbalances within such networks cause cancer or premature declines in stem cell activity that resemble accelerated aging.

The polycomb factor BMI-1 has recently been implicated in tumorigenesis of the central nervous system in several experimental animal models. However, the significance of BMI-1 in human glioma has not been investigated. Here we describe expression of the polycomb protein BMI-1 and its downstream targets p16(Ink4a) and MDM2 in both high- and low-grade human glioma. Tumour samples were collected from 305 adult patients treated for primary grades 2-4 gliomas between 1980 and 2006 in Finland and Germany. BMI-1, p16 and MDM2 expression was evaluated using immunohistochemistry in representative paraffin-embedded tumour tissue. The significance of observed immunoreactivity, age at onset, gender, histopathological findings and proliferative index was analysed in univariate and multivariate survival models. BMI-1 was expressed in all histologic types of diffuse gliomas. We found a significant correlation (P = 0.007) between the frequency of BMI-1 immunoreactive tumour cells and poor survival in World Health Organization grades II-III oligodendrogliomas and oligoastrocytomas (n = 62). The median survival of patients grouped by low, intermediate or high frequency of BMI-1 immunoreactive tumour cells was 191 months, 151 months and 68 months, respectively. This association was also significant in the Cox multivariate regression model. Nuclear p16 immunopositivity predicted better survival in astrocytomas and an inverse correlation between p16 expression and the Ki-67 mitotic index was also observed. BMI-1 is found in all histological types of gliomas and the relative protein expression of BMI-1 is a novel independent prognostic marker in oligodendroglial tumours.

The Bmi-1 oncoprotein regulates proliferation and oncogenesis in human cells. Its overexpression leads to senescence bypass in human fibroblasts and immortalization of human mammary epithelial cells. In this study, we report that compared with normal nasopharyngeal epithelial cells (NPEC), Bmi-1 is overexpressed in nasopharyngeal carcinoma cell lines. Importantly, Bmi-1 was also found to be overexpressed in 29 of 75 nasopharyngeal carcinoma tumors (38.7%) by immunohistochemical analysis. In contrast to nasopharyngeal carcinoma, there was no detectable expression of Bmi-1 in noncancerous nasopharyngeal epithelium. Moreover, high Bmi-1 expression positively correlated with poor prognosis of nasopharyngeal carcinoma patients. We also report that the overexpression of Bmi-1 leads to bypass of senescence and immortalization of NPECs, which normally express p16(INK4a) and exhibit finite replicative life span. Overexpression of Bmi-1 in NPECs led to the induction of human telomerase reverse transcriptase activity and reduction of p16(INK4a) expression. Mutational analysis of Bmi-1 showed that both RING finger and helix-turn-helix domains of it are required for immortalization of NPECs. Our findings suggest that Bmi-1 plays an important role in the development and progression of nasopharyngeal carcinoma, and that Bmi-1 is a valuable marker for assessing the prognosis of nasopharyngeal carcinoma patients. Furthermore, this study provides the first cellular proto-oncogene immortalized nasopharyngeal epithelial cell line, which may serve as a cell model system for studying the mechanisms involved in the tumorigenesis of nasopharyngeal carcinoma.

Stem cell-like cells have recently been identified in melanoma cell lines, but their relevance for melanoma pathogenesis is controversial. To characterize the stem cell signature of melanoma, expression of stem cell markers BMI-1 and nestin was studied in 64 cutaneous melanomas, 165 melanoma metastases as well as 53 melanoma cell lines. Stem cell renewal factor BMI-1 is a transcriptional repressor of the Ink4a/Arf locus encoding p16(ink4a) and p14(Arf). Increased nuclear BMI-1 expression was detectable in 41 of 64 (64%) primary melanomas, 117 of 165 melanoma metastases (71%) and 15 of 53 (28%) melanoma cell lines. High nestin expression was observed in 14 of 56 primary melanomas (25%), 84 of 165 melanoma metastases (50%) and 21 of 53 melanoma cell lines (40%). There was a significant correlation between BMI-1 and nestin expression in cell lines (p = 0.001) and metastases (p = 0.02). These data indicate that cells in primary melanomas and their metastases may have stem cell properties. Cell lines obtained from melanoma metastases showed a significant higher BMI-1 expression compared to cell lines from primary melanoma (p = 0.001). Further, primary melanoma lacking lymphatic metastases at presentation (pN0, n = 40) was less frequently BMI-1 positive than melanomas presenting with lymphatic metastases (pN1; n = 24; 52% versus 83%; p = 0.01). Therefore, BMI-1 expression appears to induce a metastatic tendency. Because BMI-1 functions as a transcriptional repressor of the Ink4a/Arf locus, p16(ink4a) and p14(Arf) expression was also analyzed. A high BMI-1/low p16(ink4a) expression pattern was a significant predictor of metastasis by means of logistic regression analysis (p = 0.005). This suggests that BMI-1 mediated repression of p16(ink4a) may contribute to an increased aggressive behavior of stem cell-like melanoma cells.

Human Polycomb-group (PcG) genes play a crucial role in the regulation of embryonic development and regulation of the cell cycle and hematopoiesis. PcG genes encode proteins that form two distinct PcG complexes, involved in maintenance of cell identity and gene silencing patterns. We recently showed that expression of the BMI-1 and EZH2 PcG genes is separated during normal B-cell development in germinal centers, whereas Hodgkin/Reed-Sternberg (H/RS) cells co-express BMI-1 and EZH2. In the current study, we used immunohistochemistry and immunofluorescence to determine whether the binding partners of these PcG proteins are also present in H/RS cells and H/RS-derived cell lines. PcG expression profiles were analyzed in combination with expression of the cell cycle inhibitor p16INK4a, because experimental model systems indicate that p16 is a downstream target of Bmi-1. We found that H/RS cells and HL-derived cell lines co-express all core proteins of the two known PcG complexes, including BMI-1, MEL-18, RING1, HPH1, HPC1, and -2, EED, EZH2, YY1, and the HPC2 binding partner, CtBP. Expression of HPC1 has not been found in normal mature B cells and other malignant lymphomas of B-cell origin, suggesting that the PcG expression profile of H/RS is unique. In contrast to Bmi-1 transgenic mice where p16INK4a is down-regulated, 27 of 52 BMI-1POS cases of HL revealed strong nuclear expression of p16INK4a. We propose that abnormal expression of BMI-1 and its binding partners in H/RS cells contributes to development of HL. However, abnormal expression of BMI-1 in HL is not necessarily associated with down-regulation of p16INK4a.

Bmi-1 is required for the post-natal maintenance of stem cells in multiple tissues including the central nervous system (CNS) and peripheral nervous system (PNS). Deletion of Ink4a or Arf from Bmi-1(-/-) mice partially rescued stem cell self-renewal and stem cell frequency in the CNS and PNS, as well as forebrain proliferation and gut neurogenesis. Arf deficiency, but not Ink4a deficiency, partially rescued cerebellum development, demonstrating regional differences in the sensitivity of progenitors to p16Ink4a and p19Arf. Deletion of both Ink4a and Arf did not affect the growth or survival of Bmi-1(-/-) mice or completely rescue neural development. Bmi-1 thus prevents the premature senescence of neural stem cells by repressing Ink4a and Arf, but additional pathways must also function downstream of Bmi-1.

Previous studies have shown that Bmi-1 is overexpressed in a variety of tumors, suggesting that Bmi-1 plays an important role in tumorigenesis. In this study, we investigated the effect of Bim-1 siRNA on cell proliferation, cell cycle, cell apoptosis and migration of human esophageal carcinoma EC9706 cells, and explored its potential mechanisms. Bmi-1 small interfering RNA (siRNA) was transferred into EC9706 cells. Then, cell proliferation was measured using cell counting kit-8 (CCK-8), cell cycle and cell apoptosis were analyzed by flow cytometry, cell migration ability was detected using Boyden chamber assay, and the mRNA and protein expression levels of Bmi-1, p16, Bcl-2, Bax, and MMP-2 were determined using real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and Western blot analysis, respectively. Bmi-1 siRNA treatment significantly inhibited the expression of Bmi-1 at both mRNA and protein levels in EC9706 cells. Cell proliferation rate decreased dramatically in the Bmi-1 siRNA treated group than in the untreated group and in the scrambled siRNA treated group (both P < 0.001). In Bmi-1 treated group, the percentage of cells at G(0)/G(1) stage was 71.93%, which was higher than that in the untreated group (47.36%) or scramble siRNA treated group (48.47%) (both P < 0.001). Early cell apoptosis rate also increased significantly in the Bmi-1 siRNA treated group (both 17.32%) than in the untreated group (2.61%) and in the scramble siRNA treated group (2.73%) (both P < 0.001). Further experiment suggested that downregulation of Bmi-1 led to less cell migration. In EC9706 cells transfected by Bmi-1 siRNA, the expression levels of p16 and Bax increased, while the expression level of Bcl-2 decreased. Bmi-1 downregulation in esophageal carcinoma cells inhibits cell proliferation, cell cycle, and cell migration, while increases cell apoptosis. These results suggest that Bmi-1 is a potential molecular target of treating esophageal cancer.

Because evasion of tumor suppression is a critical step in cancer development, cancer cells have developed a variety of mechanisms to circumvent the influence of tumor suppressive pathways. Thus, genes that negatively regulate tumor suppressors could be considered novel types of oncogenes such as Bmi-1 repressing p16Ink4a and inhibiting p53 and were found to be frequently up-regulated in a variety of cancers. p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK), which reportedly plays a crucial role as a tumor suppressor, is activated in number of lung adenocarcinomas, which is seemingly at odds with its role as a tumor suppressor. We examined 10 lung adenocarcinomas and corresponding normal tissues and determined the expression levels of a variety of tumor suppressor proteins through real-time polymerase chain reaction and immunohistochemistry and measured p38 MAPK activity by immunoblotting or immunohistochemistry analysis. In the in vitro cellular model, p38 activation by H-Ras and consequent senescence induction was achieved through retro-viral gene transduction. Similarly, the suppression of p16Ink4a by Bmi-1 after the introduction of H-Ras was achieved through transient transfection with cationic liposome. We detected several lung adenocarcinomas that were positive for activated p38 MAPK but evidenced reduced levels of p16Ink4a expression. The suppression of p16Ink4a occurred in parallel with an increase in Bmi-1 and/or p16Ink4a promoter hypermethylation. Consistent with these observations, the H-Ras-stimulated induction of p16Ink4a was suppressed significantly through the coexpression of Bmi-1 in vitro. These results demonstrate that the suppression of p16Ink4a by either the induction of Bmi-1 or the hypermethylation of p16Ink4 may be an important step in avoiding tumor surveillance by p38 MAPK during the development of lung cancer.

Activation of telomerase is sufficient for immortalization of some types of human cells but additional factors may also be essential. It has been proposed that stress imposed by inadequate culture conditions induces senescence due to accumulation of p16(INK4a). Here, we present evidence that many human cell types undergo senescence by activation of the p16(INK4a)/Rb pathway, and that introduction of Bmi-1 can inhibit p16(INK4a) expression and extend the life span of human epithelial cells derived from skin, mammary gland and lung. Introduction of p16(INK4a)-specific short hairpin RNA, as well as Bmi-1, suppressed p16(INK4a) expression in human mammary epithelial cells without promoter methylation, and extended their life span. Subsequent introduction of hTERT, the telomerase catalytic subunit, into cells with low p16(INK4a) levels resulted in efficient immortalization of three cell types without crisis or growth arrest. The majority of the human mammary epithelial cells thus immortalized showed almost normal ploidy as judged by G-banding and spectral karyotyping analysis. Our data suggest that inhibition of p16(INK4a) and introduction of hTERT can immortalize many human cell types with little chromosomal instability.

The polycomb gene Bmi-1 is required for the self-renewal of stem cells from diverse tissues, including the central nervous system (CNS). Bmi-1 expression is elevated in most human gliomas, irrespective of grade, raising the question of whether Bmi-1 over-expression is sufficient to promote self-renewal or tumorigenesis by CNS stem/progenitor cells. To test this we generated Nestin-Bmi-1-GFP transgenic mice. Analysis of two independent lines with expression in the fetal and adult CNS demonstrated that transgenic neural stem cells formed larger colonies, more self-renewing divisions, and more neurons in culture. However, in vivo, Bmi-1 over-expression had little effect on CNS stem cell frequency, subventricular zone proliferation, olfactory bulb neurogenesis, or neurogenesis/gliogenesis during development. Bmi-1 transgenic mice were born with enlarged lateral ventricles and a minority developed idiopathic hydrocephalus as adults, but none of the transgenic mice formed detectable CNS tumors, even when aged. The more pronounced effects of Bmi-1 over-expression in culture were largely attributable to the attenuated induction of p16(Ink4a) and p19(Arf) in culture, proteins that are generally not expressed by neural stem/progenitor cells in young mice in vivo. Bmi-1 over-expression therefore has more pronounced effects in culture and does not appear to be sufficient to induce tumorigenesis in vivo.

Loss-of-function alterations of INK4A are commonly observed in lymphoid malignancies, but are consistently absent in pre-B cell leukemias induced by the chimeric oncoprotein E2a-Pbx1 created by t(1;19) chromosomal translocations. We report here that experimental induction of E2a-Pbx1 enhances expression of BMI-1, a lymphoid oncogene whose product functions as a transcriptional repressor of the INK4A-ARF tumor suppressor locus. Bmi-1-deficient hematopoietic progenitors are resistant to transformation by E2a-Pbx1; however, the requirement for Bmi-1 is alleviated in cells deficient for both Bmi-1 and INK4A-ARF. Furthermore, the adverse effects of E2a-Pbx1 on pre-B cell survival and differentiation are partially bypassed by forced expression of p16(Ink4a). These results link E2a-Pbx1 with Bmi-1 on an oncogenic pathway that is likely to play a role in the pathogenesis of human lymphoid leukemias through downregulation of the INK4A-ARF gene.

Stem cells persist throughout life by self-renewing in numerous tissues including the central and peripheral nervous systems. This raises the issue of whether there is a conserved mechanism to effect self-renewing divisions. Deficiency in the polycomb family transcriptional repressor Bmi-1 leads to progressive postnatal growth retardation and neurological defects. Here we show that Bmi-1 is required for the self-renewal of stem cells in the peripheral and central nervous systems but not for their survival or differentiation. The reduced self-renewal of Bmi-1-deficient neural stem cells leads to their postnatal depletion. In the absence of Bmi-1, the cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor gene p16Ink4a is upregulated in neural stem cells, reducing the rate of proliferation. p16Ink4a deficiency partially reverses the self-renewal defect in Bmi-1-/- neural stem cells. This conserved requirement for Bmi-1 to promote self-renewal and to repress p16Ink4a expression suggests that a common mechanism regulates the self-renewal and postnatal persistence of diverse types of stem cell. Restricted neural progenitors from the gut and forebrain proliferate normally in the absence of Bmi-1. Thus, Bmi-1 dependence distinguishes stem cell self-renewal from restricted progenitor proliferation in these tissues.

To clarify the roles of Bmi-1 in colorectal carcinoma, we examined the expression of Bmi-1 in 41 samples out of 46 colorectal carcinomas by reverse transcription-PCR, whereas all 46 were analyzed by immunostaining. In addition, we analyzed the expression patterns of Bmi-1 in association with p16INK4a and p14ARF (in mouse p19ARF) in a series of colorectal carcinomas. The level of Bmi-1 mRNA in the carcinoma tissues was significantly higher than those of the adjacent non-neoplastic colonic mucosal tissues. Immunohistochemistry for Bmi-1 showed moderate or strong expression levels in 65% (30/46) of colorectal carcinomas. Colorectal carcinomas with moderate or strong Bmi-1 expression were more likely to have low levels of the INK4 locus proteins (p16INK4a/p14ARF) (P<0.07). These results suggested that modulation of Bmi-1 protein might be involved in human colorectal carcinogenesis by repressing the INK4a/ARF proteins.

Increased mitogenic signaling by positive effectors such as Ras or Myc can trigger senescence in normal cells, a response believed to function as a tumor-suppressive mechanism. We report here the existence of a checkpoint that monitors hypoproliferative signaling imbalances. Normal human fibroblasts with one copy of the c-myc gene inactivated by targeted homologous recombination switched with an increased frequency to a telomere-independent senescent state mediated by the cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor p16(INK4a). p16(INK4a) expression was regulated by the Polycomb group repressor Bmi-1, which we show is a direct transcriptional target of c-Myc. The Myc-Bmi circuit provides a mechanism for the conversion of environmental inputs that converge on c-Myc into discrete cell-fate decisions coupled to cell-cycle recruitment. A mechanism for limiting the proliferation of damaged or otherwise physiologically compromised cells would be expected to have important consequences on the generation of replicatively senescent cells during organismal aging.

Deregulation of mammalian Polycomb group (PcG) members may contribute to human carcinogenesis. p16INK4a and p14ARF tumor suppressors, human telomerase reverse transcriptase (h-TERT), and oncoprotein c-Myc have been implicated in the regulation of the cell cycle and proliferation mediated by PcG proteins, mainly Bmi-1, in mice and in cell culture experiments. Here, we examine whether these in vitro findings can be extrapolated to the in vivo situation. We measure the expression of PcG members Bmi-1, Mel-18, and Hpc-2 and their potential targets by reverse transcription-PCR, immunostaining, and Western blotting in a series of 134 breast carcinomas and correlate the data with several clinical-pathologic variables of the tumors. Expression of PcG genes was variably detected, but overexpression of Bmi-1 was the most frequent PcG alteration observed. In addition, statistical direct correlation in expression level of the three PcG members was detected. A correlation between c-Myc and Bmi-1 expression levels was observed; however, there was no correlation between expression of Bmi-1 and p16INK4a, p14ARF, or h-TERT. However, expression of the other PcG members Mel-18 and Hpc-2 correlated with the cell cycle regulators. Moreover, PcG mRNA-altered expression correlated significantly with certain clinical-pathologic variables associated with poor prognosis. Our data suggest that the oncogenic role of Bmi-1 in human primary breast carcinomas is not determined by its capacity to inhibit INK4a/ARF proteins or to induce telomerase activity.

Mantle-cell lymphoma (MCL) is a well-defined subtype of B-cell non-Hodgkin's lymphomas (B-NHL), accounts for approximately 6% of all lymphoid neoplasms, and has a median survival of 3 to 4 years. The genetic hallmark of MCL is the chromosomal translocation t(11;14)(q13;q32) that leads to deregulation and upregulation of Cyclin D1, an important regulator of the G1 phase of the cell cycle. This genetic event is present in virtually all cases of MCL, whereas additional genetic alterations that occur in subsets of MCL have been described. Most of these alterations appear to disturb the cell cycle machinery/interfere with the cellular response to DNA damage, thus making MCL a paradigm for cell cycle and DNA damage response dysregulation in cancer in general. In particular, Cyclin D1 upregulation, genomic amplification of the cyclin-dependent kinase (CDK) -4, deletions of the CDK inhibitor p16(INK4a) and overexpression of BMI-1, a transcriptional repressor of the p16(INK4a) locus, are associated with dysregulation of the cell cycle machinery in MCL. The DNA damage response pathway is affected by frequent alterations of the ataxia-telangiectasia mutated (ATM) kinase as well as occasional inactivation of checkpoint kinase (CHK)-1 and CHK2 that are kinases that act downstream of ATM in response to detection of DNA damage. Moreover, p53 is frequently targeted by alterations in MCL. A recent gene expression profiling study defined the proliferation signature, a quantitative measure of gene expression of proliferation-associated genes as the strongest survival predictor available to date allowing the definition of prognostic MCL subgroups that differ in median survival by more than 5 years.

The polycomb protein Bmi-1 represses the INK4a locus, which encodes the tumor suppressors p16 and p14(ARF). Here we report that Bmi-1 is downregulated when WI-38 human fibroblasts undergo replicative senescence, but not quiescence, and extends replicative life span when overexpressed. Life span extension by Bmi-1 required the pRb, but not p53, tumor suppressor protein. Deletion analysis showed that the RING finger and helix-turn-helix domains of Bmi-1 were required for life span extension and suppression of p16. Furthermore, a RING finger deletion mutant exhibited dominant negative activity, inducing p16 and premature senescence. Interestingly, presenescent cultures of some, but not all, human fibroblasts contained growth-arrested cells expressing high levels of p16 and apparently arrested by a p53- and telomere-independent mechanism. Bmi-1 selectively extended the life span of these cultures. Low O(2) concentrations had no effect on p16 levels or life span extension by Bmi-1 but reduced expression of the p53 target, p21. We propose that some human fibroblast strains are more sensitive to stress-induced senescence and have both p16-dependent and p53/telomere-dependent pathways of senescence. Our data suggest that Bmi-1 extends the replicative life span of human fibroblasts by suppressing the p16-dependent senescence pathway.

A central issue in stem cell biology is to understand the mechanisms that regulate the self-renewal of haematopoietic stem cells (HSCs), which are required for haematopoiesis to persist for the lifetime of the animal. We found that adult and fetal mouse and adult human HSCs express the proto-oncogene Bmi-1. The number of HSCs in the fetal liver of Bmi-1-/- mice was normal. In postnatal Bmi-1-/- mice, the number of HSCs was markedly reduced. Transplanted fetal liver and bone marrow cells obtained from Bmi-1-/- mice were able to contribute only transiently to haematopoiesis. There was no detectable self-renewal of adult HSCs, indicating a cell autonomous defect in Bmi-1-/- mice. A gene expression analysis revealed that the expression of stem cell associated genes, cell survival genes, transcription factors, and genes modulating proliferation including p16Ink4a and p19Arf was altered in bone marrow cells of the Bmi-1-/- mice. Expression of p16Ink4a and p19Arf in normal HSCs resulted in proliferative arrest and p53-dependent cell death, respectively. Our results indicate that Bmi-1 is essential for the generation of self-renewing adult HSCs.

Accumulation of senescent cells contributes to the reduced regenerative capacity in aged tissues. By evaluating the molecular pathways of senescence in relation to proliferative potential of primary keratinocyte cultures from young and old healthy donors, and from young patients with inherited defects leading to premature aging, we demonstrated that p16(INK4a) is a reliable marker of both physiological and premature epidermal aging. Analysis of the expression and activity of p16(INK4a) regulators showed that stem cell depletion, reduced proliferation, and p16(INK4a) upregulation in keratinocytes derived from the chronologically and prematurely aged epidermis strongly correlate with Bmi-1 downregulation. In highly proliferative tissues, replicative and premature senescence participate in determining senescent cell accumulation. Our findings demonstrated that Bmi-1 is downregulated in human keratinocytes during both in vitro processes, in parallel with p16(INK4a) upregulation and accomplishment of clonal conversion. When premature senescence was induced by specific exogenous stimuli, concomitant Ets-1 upregulation was also observed. Moreover, Bmi-1 inhibited Ets-1-mediated p16(INK4a) upregulation. Finally, Bmi-1 overexpression reduced p16(INK4a) promoter activity and decreased protein expression in aged and diseased keratinocytes, inducing a delay of clonal conversion and an increase of cell clonogenic ability. Altogether these findings underline a key role of Bmi-1 downregulation in enforcing aging in primary human keratinocytes.

Bmi-1 gene determines the proliferative capacity of normal and leukemia stem cells. Expression of Bmi-1 has been found in all types of myeloid leukemia cells in both humans and mice. This study aimed at assessing the effect of antisense Bmi-1 expression on K562 cells proliferation and p16 protein (p16) expression. A transcriptional repressor, Bmi-1 cDNA was cloned by reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) of its mRNA from K562 cells. A plasmid expressing antisense Bmi-1 mRNA was then constructed by reverse design of PCR primers and cloned to the plasmid pLNCX2; G418 was added to the medium after the plasmid was successfully introduced in K562 cells by lipofectin-mediated DNA transfection. The effects of the antisense expression on the proliferation of K562 cells were analyzed by using microculture tetrazolium and colony forming. Cell cycle was analyzed by using flow cytometry. The p16 expression of K562 cells was observed by immunofluorescence histochemical stain. K562 cells transfected with antisense Bmi-1 plasmid grew significantly slower than that of controls (the parental K562 and cells transfected with empty plasmid). The colony forming ability of antisense Bmi-1 plasmid transfected cells decreased significantly (P < 0.01) compared with controls. The p16 expression of cells transfected with antisense Bmi-1 was upgraded more apparently than that of controls. The antisense Bmi-1 gene can inhibit the growth of K562 cell and upgrade expression of p16 in K562 cells.

In this issue of Cell Stem Cell, Fasano et al. (2007) investigate the role of Bmi-1 in neural stem cells in vitro and in vivo. They find a progressively increasing requirement for Bmi-1 function in stem cells during development that, surprisingly, seems to involve regulation of the cell-cycle inhibitor p21.
