We have investigated the presence of diazoxide- and nicorandil-activated K+ channels in rat skeletal muscle. Activation of potassium transport in the rat skeletal muscle myoblast cell line L6 caused a stimulation of cellular oxygen consumption, implying a mitochondrial effect. Working with isolated rat skeletal muscle mitochondria, both potassium channel openers (KCOs) stimulate respiration, depolarize the mitochondrial inner membrane and lead to oxidation of the mitochondrial NAD-system in a strict potassium-dependent manner. This is a strong indication for KCO-mediated stimulation of potassium transport at the mitochondrial inner membrane. Moreover, the potassium-specific effects of both diazoxide and nicorandil on oxidative phosphorylation in skeletal muscle mitochondria were completely abolished by the antidiabetic sulfonylurea derivative glibenclamide, a well-known inhibitor of ATP-regulated potassium channels (K(ATP) channels). Since both diazoxide and nicorandil facilitated swelling of de-energised mitochondria in KSCN buffer at the same concentrations, our results implicate the presence of a mitochondrial ATP-regulated potassium channel (mitoK(ATP) channel) in rat skeletal muscle which can modulate mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation.

Diabetes mellitus is frequent during pregnancy and is associated with substantial risks both for the mother and the newborn. An adequate therapy ensures the normal course of pregnancy and delivery and postnatal development of the baby. Insulin, for its well known safety record, has long been considered the drug of first choice for achieving optimal glycemic control in pregnant women. Pregnancy is an indication for intensive insulin therapy. The pre-mixed insulins are not recommended due to their inability to provide the needed therapeutic flexibility during the different periods of pregnancy. The short acting insulin analogue aspart is currently registered for meal-time use in basal therapy with NPH insulin. The long-acting analogues glargine and detemir are still investigated clinically and for the moment are only used off label in pregnancy. Maternal hypoglycemia, the need of injection and the high cost are the main drawbacks of insulin therapy. Evidence has accumulated in recent years that some oral antidiabetics are as efficacious and safe as insulin in gestational diabetes. Metformin and glibenclamide are now increasingly viewed as a rational alternative to insulin therapy--a treatment both preferred by the women and a less expensive one, during pregnancy and breastfeeding.

1. The hypoglycaemic effect of fermented seeds of Parkia biglobosa (PB; African locust bean), a natural nutritional condiment that features frequently in some African diets as a spice, was investigated in the present study in alloxan-induced diabetic rats. Its effect was compared with that of glibenclamide (Daonil; Sanofi-Aventis, Paris, France), a reference antidiabetic drug. The effects of PB on lipid profiles were also examined. 2. In order to assess the hypoglycaemic and hypolipidaemic effects of aqueous and methanolic extracts of PB on experimental animals, fasting plasma glucose (FPG), total cholesterol, triglyceride, high-density lipoprotein (HDL) and low-density lipoprotein (LDL) were determined. In addition, the weight of each animal was determined to assess any possible weight gain or loss in the experimental animals (diabetic rats treated with Daonil (group C), the aqueous extract of PB (group D) or the methanolic extract of PB (group E)) compared with control groups (non-diabetic (group A) and non-treated diabetic (group B)). 3. A single dose of 120 mg/kg, i.v., alloxan administered to rats resulted in significant increases in the FPG (P < 0.001) of test animals compared with controls. However, dietary supplementation with PB (6 g/kg extract for 4 weeks administered orally using an intragastric tube) ameliorated the alloxan-induced diabetes in a manner comparable with that of the reference antidiabetic drug glibenclamide. Aqueous and methanolic extracts of PB (6% w/w) elicited 69.2% and 64.4% reductions, respectively, in FPG compared with 70.4% in 0.01 mg/150 g glibenclamide-treated rats. 4. Although animals treated with the aqueous extract of PB gained weight in manner similar to normal controls, animals given the methanolic extract and glibenclamide lost weight in manner similar to non-treated diabetic rats. In addition, high levels of HDL and low LDL were observed in animals treated with the aqueous extract of PB, a pattern similar to that seen in normal controls. Low levels of HDL and high levels of LDL were observed in animals treated with the methanolic extract of PB, a pattern similar to that seen in non-treated diabetic controls. 5. The results of the present study demonstrate that both aqueous and methanolic extracts of fermented seeds of PB exert a hypoglycaemic effect; hence, PB has an antidiabetic property. However, only the aqueous extract of PB ameliorated the loss of bodyweight usually associated with diabetes. Although the aqueous extract has a favourable lipid profile, which is probably an indication of its possible anti-arteriogenic property (hypertension and ischaemic heart diseases being common complications in diabetes mellitus), the methanolic extract shows possible contraindication to ischaemic heart diseases.

In normal weight persons with impaired glucose tolerance (IGT; normal fasting glycaemia and pathological glucose tolerance) and still normal or already decreased insulin secretion the influence of glibenclamide (maninil) on the carbohydrate and lipid metabolism as well as the insulin secretion was studied after one year (n = 18), after 2 years (n =13), after 3 years (n = 10) and after 5 years (n = 6). Glucose tolerance and insulin secretion were characterized by means of a 2 hours' glucose infusion test (0.33 g/kg as bolus and 12 mg/kg/min over 120 min). In no case the diabetes became manifest during the 5-year duration of the observation. An improvement of the glucose tolerance could be observed up to 3 years, whereas after a 5-year glibenclamide therapy no certain influence on the glucose tolerance and insulin secretion could be proved. In general the improvement of the glucose tolerance was not associated with an increased secretion of insulin, so that an extrapancreatic effect of glibenclamide (improvement of the peripheral insulin sensitivity?) seems to be possible. A complete normalization of the glucose tolerance could be observed only in some individual cases. The body-weight remained constant in all groups, whereas the concentration of triglyceride and cholesterol decreased in their tendency. From clinical and practical point of view the findings would support the opinion that normal weight persons with IGT, particularly in already decreased insulin secretion, have an indication for a glibenclamide therapy.

"In all things of nature there is something of the marvelous". In the present study the anti-hyperglycemic and anti-oxidative potential of aqueous extract of Trigonella foenum graceum (TFG), a traditional medicinal herb was assessed in liver and WBC of alloxan induced diabetic rats. Free radicals can cause oxidative damage, which is balanced by the antioxidants. This has been implicated in aging, and diseases such as diabetes and other chronic conditions. TFG extract was administered orally [500 (LM) and 1000 mg/kg body weight (HM)] for six weeks. The effect of TFG on blood glucose were studied and the levels of lipid peroxidation [MDA (Malondialdehyde)] and antioxidant enzymes [SOD (Superoxide dismutase), GPx (Reduced Glutathione peroxidase)] were estimated and compared with standard drugs glibenclamide and insulin. Treatment with TFG, insulin and glibenclamide resulted in significantly reduced blood glucose in LM (8.71%) and HM (3.87%) in comparison with normal controls. There was a significant decrease in lipid peroxidation in liver and white blood cells (WBC) in both low and high doses [liver LM (49%), HM (57.25%)], [WBC LM (54.28%), HM (62.5%)] and increase in antioxidant enzymes SOD [liver LM (33.59%), HM (58.7%)] [WBC LM (44.9%)] HM (58.7%) and GPx [Liver LM (58.55%), HM (40.20%)], [WBC LM (55.46%), HM (56.4%)] when compared to diabetic controls. Potency of TFG in restoring several parameters to normal values is comparable to glibenclamide, though not as efficient as insulin, an indication of its antihyperglycemic and antioxidant effect.

The main action of SU in the treatment of diabetes mellitus is the stimulation of insulin secretion, and the extrapancreatic action including stimulation of insulin actions in glycogen synthesis and inhibition of glucose production in liver is also reported. The indication of SU in the treatment of diabetes mellitus is for NIDDM usually after diet therapy or suitable exercise therapy. In IDDM and several special cases including diabetic ketoacidosis, severe infection, pregnancy, poor-controlled NIDDM, gangrane, surgery operation, severe renal or hepatic failure et al. insulin therapy should be started. In mild NIDDM, gliclazide, tolbutamide or acetohexamide is used, and in more severe NIDDM glibenclamide is used. The action time of chlorpropamide is very long, usually from 20 to 60 hours, therefore special care should be taken for hypoglycemia. As the causes for secondary failure, transition from NIDDM to IDDM, failure of diet therapy, glucose toxity and others are considered.
