For millions of women, breast cancer remains a potentially life-endangering diagnosis. With advances in research, new therapies targeted to tumor biology are emerging to treat the most common form of this disease. Cyclin-dependent kinase (CDK) 4/6 inhibitors are a new class of therapeutic agents that have the potential to improve the outcomes of patients with hormone receptor-positive (HR(+)) breast cancer. Three CDK 4/6 inhibitors have been investigated for the treatment of HR(+) breast cancer, including palbociclib (PD 0332991), ribociclib (LEE011), and abemaciclib (LY2835219). Palbociclib recently received accelerated Food and Drug Administration approval for the treatment of HR(+) metastatic breast cancer in combination with letrozole, and recent data suggest improved outcome when combined with fulvestrant. In this article, the mechanism of action of CDK 4/6 inhibitors, preclinical studies on their efficacy, ongoing clinical trials in breast cancer, and toxicity profiles are reviewed.

<b>Purpose:</b> Neuroblastoma is treated with aggressive multimodal therapy, yet more than 50% of patients experience relapse. We recently showed that relapsed neuroblastomas frequently harbor mutations leading to hyperactivated ERK signaling and sensitivity to MEK inhibition therapy. Here we sought to define a synergistic therapeutic partner to potentiate MEK inhibition.<b>Experimental Design:</b> We first surveyed 22 genetically annotated human neuroblastoma-derived cell lines (from 20 unique patients) for sensitivity to the MEK inhibitor binimetinib. After noting an inverse correlation with sensitivity to ribociclib (CDK4/6 inhibitor), we studied the combinatorial effect of these two agents using proliferation assays, cell-cycle analysis, Ki67 immunostaining, time-lapse microscopy, and xenograft studies.<b>Results:</b> Sensitivity to binimetinib and ribociclib was inversely related (<i>r</i> = -0.58, <i>P</i> = 0.009). <i>MYCN</i> amplification status and expression were associated with ribociclib sensitivity and binimetinib resistance, whereas increased MAPK signaling was the main determinant of binimetinib sensitivity and ribociclib resistance. Treatment with both compounds resulted in synergistic or additive cellular growth inhibition in all lines tested and significant inhibition of tumor growth in three of four xenograft models of neuroblastoma. The augmented growth inhibition was attributed to diminished cell-cycle progression that was reversible upon removal of drugs.<b>Conclusions:</b> Here we demonstrate that combined binimetinib and ribociclib treatment shows therapeutic synergy across a broad panel of high-risk neuroblastoma preclinical models. These data support testing this combination therapy in relapsed high-risk neuroblastoma patients, with focus on cases with hyperactivated RAS-MAPK signaling. <i>Clin Cancer Res; 23(7); 1785-96.

The cyclin D-cyclin dependent kinase (CDK) 4/6-inhibitor of CDK4 (INK4)-retinoblastoma (Rb) pathway controls cell cycle progression by regulating the G1-S checkpoint. Dysregulation of the cyclin D-CDK4/6-INK4-Rb pathway results in increased proliferation, and is frequently observed in many types of cancer. Pathway activation can occur through a variety of mechanisms, including gene amplification or rearrangement, loss of negative regulators, epigenetic alterations, and point mutations in key pathway components. Due to the importance of CDK4/6 activity in cancer cells, CDK4/6 inhibitors have emerged as promising candidates for cancer treatment. Moreover, combination of a CDK4/6 inhibitor with other targeted therapies may help overcome acquired or de novo treatment resistance. Ongoing studies include combinations of CDK4/6 inhibitors with endocrine therapy and phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K) pathway inhibitors for hormone receptor-positive (HR+) breast cancers, and with selective RAF and MEK inhibitors for tumors with alterations in the mitogen activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathway such as melanoma. In particular, the combination of CDK4/6 inhibitors with endocrine therapy, such as palbociclib's recent first-line approval in combination with letrozole, is expected to transform the treatment of HR+ breast cancer. Currently, three selective CDK4/6 inhibitors have been approved or are in late-stage development: palbociclib (PD-0332991), ribociclib (LEE011), and abemaciclib (LY2835219). Here we describe the current preclinical and clinical data for these novel agents and discuss combination strategies with other agents for the treatment of cancer.

Cancer cells bypass normal controls over mitotic cell-cycle progression to achieve a deregulated state of proliferation. The retinoblastoma tumor suppressor protein (pRb) governs a key cell-cycle checkpoint that normally prevents G1-phase cells from entering S-phase in the absence of appropriate mitogenic signals. Cancer cells frequently overcome pRb-dependent growth suppression via constitutive phosphorylation and inactivation of pRb function by cyclin-dependent kinase (CDK) 4 or CDK6 partnered with D-type cyclins. Three selective CDK4/6 inhibitors, palbociclib (Ibrance; Pfizer), ribociclib (Novartis), and abemaciclib (Lilly), are in various stages of development in a variety of pRb-positive tumor types, including breast cancer, melanoma, liposarcoma, and non-small cell lung cancer. The emerging, positive clinical data obtained to date finally validate the two decades-old hypothesis that the cyclin D-CDK4/6 pathway is a rational target for cancer therapy.

In this article, we not only review the preclinical and clinical studies of cyclin-dependent kinase (CDK) 4/6 inhibitors in breast cancer, liposarcoma, mantel cell lymphoma, melanoma and germ cell tumors, but also examine promising preclinical data in glioblastoma, renal and ovarian cancer models that may provide directions for future development. Targeting CDKs has been the focus of considerable basic science and clinical research. The CDK 4/6 inhibitors are a novel class of therapeutics that target the CDK 4/6 kinases that promote transition through the cell cycle. Currently, palbociclib (PD0332991, Pfizer), abemaciclib (LY2835219, Lilly) and ribociclib (LEE011, Novartis) are being investigated in clinical trials. These oral agents offer the hope of clinical efficacy in many tumor types, and have been associated with minimal toxicity. Amplification/overexpression of cyclin D, loss of CDKN2A (p16) and amplification/overexpression of CDK4 are proposed biomarkers of improved response to CDK4/6 inhibition. Palbociclib, abemaciclib and ribociclib have demonstrated very promising clinical activity in breast cancer, liposarcoma, mantel cell lymphoma and melanoma. Moreover, CDK4/6 inhibitors have shown promising preclinical activity in glioblastoma, renal and ovarian cancer models that may provide directions for their future clinical development. Further preclinical and clinical research is needed to better understand mechanisms of resistance and develop rational combination therapies with other targeted agents.

Uncontrolled cellular proliferation, mediated by dysregulation of the cell-cycle machinery and activation of cyclin-dependent kinases (CDKs) to promote cell-cycle progression, lies at the heart of cancer as a pathological process. Clinical implementation of first-generation, nonselective CDK inhibitors, designed to inhibit this proliferation, was originally hampered by the high risk of toxicity and lack of efficacy noted with these agents. The emergence of a new generation of selective CDK4/6 inhibitors, including ribociclib, abemaciclib and palbociclib, has enabled tumour types in which CDK4/6 has a pivotal role in the G1-to-S-phase cell-cycle transition to be targeted with improved effectiveness, and fewer adverse effects. Results of pivotal phase III trials investigating palbociclib in patients with advanced-stage oestrogen receptor (ER)-positive breast cancer have demonstrated a substantial improvement in progression-free survival, with a well-tolerated toxicity profile. Mechanisms of acquired resistance to CDK4/6 inhibitors are beginning to emerge that, although unwelcome, might enable rational post-CDK4/6 inhibitor therapeutic strategies to be identified. Extending the use of CDK4/6 inhibitors beyond ER-positive breast cancer is challenging, and will likely require biomarkers that are predictive of a response, and the use of combination therapies in order to optimize CDK4/6 targeting.

Although survival rates among patients with breast cancer have improved in recent years, those diagnosed with advanced disease with distant metastasis face a 5-year survival rate of less than 25%, making the management of these patients an area still in significant need of continued research. Selecting the optimal treatment order from among the variety of currently available therapy options presents a relevant challenge for medical oncologists. With the understanding that the majority of patients with breast cancer and those who succumb to this disease have HR-positive disease, this review will focus on treatment options and treatment order in patients with HR-positive advanced breast cancer. While endocrine therapy is considered the preferred treatment for first-line therapy in HR-positive/HER2-negative breast cancer, selection of the specific agent depends on the menopausal status of the patient. Palbociclib, a cyclin-dependent kinase (CDK) 4/6 inhibitor, is also recommended as first-line treatment in patients with ER-positive/HER2-negative disease. In patients with endocrine therapy-resistant disease, specific strategies include sequencing of other antiestrogen receptor agents, or agents that target other molecular pathways. Future treatment strategies for patients with primary or secondary resistance to endocrine therapy for advanced disease are discussed. These strategies include first-line therapy with high-dose fulvestrant or everolimus (in combination with exemestane or letrozole or with other endocrine therapies), use of the PI3K inhibitors (e.g., buparlisib, alpelisib, pictilisib, taselisib), entinostat, CDK 4/6 inhibitors (e.g., palbociclib, ribociclib, abemaciclib), and novel selective estrogen receptor degradation agents that may enhance the targeting of acquired mutations in the ESR1 gene.

Therapeutically targeting aberrant intracellular kinase signaling is attractive from a biological perspective but drug development is often hindered by toxicities and inadequate efficacy. Predicting drug behaviors using cellular and animal models is confounded by redundant kinase activities, a lack of unique substrates, and cell-specific signaling networks. Cyclin-dependent kinase (CDK) drugs exemplify this phenomenon because they are reported to target common processes yet have distinct clinical activities. Tumor cell studies of ATP-competitive CDK drugs (dinaciclib, AG-024322, abemaciclib, palbociclib, ribociclib) indicate similar pharmacology while analyses in untransformed cells illuminates significant differences. To resolve this apparent disconnect, drug behaviors are described at the molecular level. Nonkinase binding studies and kinome interaction analysis (recombinant and endogenous kinases) reveal that proteins outside of the CDK family appear to have little role in dinaciclib/palbociclib/ribociclib pharmacology, may contribute for abemaciclib, and confounds AG-024322 analysis. CDK2 and CDK6 cocrystal structures with the drugs identify the molecular interactions responsible for potency and kinase selectivity. Efficient drug binding to the unique hinge architecture of CDKs enables selectivity toward most of the human kinome. Selectivity between CDK family members is achieved through interactions with nonconserved elements of the ATP-binding pocket. Integrating clinical drug exposures into the analysis predicts that both palbociclib and ribociclib are CDK4/6 inhibitors, abemaciclib inhibits CDK4/6/9, and dinaciclib is a broad-spectrum CDK inhibitor (CDK2/3/4/6/9). Understanding the molecular components of potency and selectivity also facilitates rational design of future generations of kinase-directed drugs. Mol Cancer Ther; 15(10); 2273-81. Â©2016 AACR.

Clinical and preclinical data support a significant role for inhibitors of the cyclin-dependent kinases (CDKs) 4 and 6 in the treatment of patients with breast cancer. Recently, based on data showing improvement in progression-free survival, the use of palbociclib (Ibrance; Pfizer, Inc.) in combination with endocrine agents was approved to treat patients with hormone receptor-positive advanced disease. Importantly, 2 other CDK4/6 inhibitors, abemaciclib (LY2835219; Lilly) and ribociclib (LEE011; Novartis), are in the late stage of clinical development. In this review, we will focus on clinical data on these 2 new drugs, highlighting their differences compared to palbociclib in terms of single-agent activity, central nervous system penetration, and common adverse events. In addition, we will present the ongoing clinical trials and discuss future directions in the field.

Acute kidney injury (AKI) is a potentially fatal syndrome characterized by a rapid decline in kidney function caused by ischemic or toxic injury to renal tubular cells. The widely used chemotherapy drug cisplatin accumulates preferentially in the renal tubular cells and is a frequent cause of drug-induced AKI. During the development of AKI the quiescent tubular cells reenter the cell cycle. Strategies that block cell-cycle progression ameliorate kidney injury, possibly by averting cell division in the presence of extensive DNA damage. However, the early signaling events that lead to cell-cycle activation during AKI are not known. In the current study, using mouse models of cisplatin nephrotoxicity, we show that the G1/S-regulating cyclin-dependent kinase 4/6 (CDK4/6) pathway is activated in parallel with renal cell-cycle entry but before the development of AKI. Targeted inhibition of CDK4/6 pathway by small-molecule inhibitors palbociclib (PD-0332991) and ribociclib (LEE011) resulted in inhibition of cell-cycle progression, amelioration of kidney injury, and improved overall survival. Of additional significance, these compounds were found to be potent inhibitors of organic cation transporter 2 (OCT2), which contributes to the cellular accumulation of cisplatin and subsequent kidney injury. The unique cell-cycle and OCT2-targeting activities of palbociclib and LEE011, combined with their potential for clinical translation, support their further exploration as therapeutic candidates for prevention of AKI.

The inhibition of cyclin-dependent kinases 4 and 6 (CDK4/6) could potentially overcome or delay resistance to endocrine therapy in advanced breast cancer that is positive for hormone receptor (HR) and negative for human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2). In this randomized, placebo-controlled, phase 3 trial, we evaluated the efficacy and safety of the selective CDK4/6 inhibitor ribociclib combined with letrozole for first-line treatment in 668 postmenopausal women with HR-positive, HER2-negative recurrent or metastatic breast cancer who had not received previous systemic therapy for advanced disease. We randomly assigned the patients to receive either ribociclib (600 mg per day on a 3-weeks-on, 1-week-off schedule) plus letrozole (2.5 mg per day) or placebo plus letrozole. The primary end point was investigator-assessed progression-free survival. Secondary end points included overall survival, overall response rate, and safety. A preplanned interim analysis was performed on January 29, 2016, after 243 patients had disease progression or died. Prespecified criteria for superiority required a hazard ratio of 0.56 or less with P<1.29Ã10<sup>-5</sup>. The duration of progression-free survival was significantly longer in the ribociclib group than in the placebo group (hazard ratio, 0.56; 95% CI, 0.43 to 0.72; P=3.29Ã10<sup>-6</sup> for superiority). The median duration of follow-up was 15.3 months. After 18 months, the progression-free survival rate was 63.0% (95% confidence interval [CI], 54.6 to 70.3) in the ribociclib group and 42.2% (95% CI, 34.8 to 49.5) in the placebo group. In patients with measurable disease at baseline, the overall response rate was 52.7% and 37.1%, respectively (P<0.001). Common grade 3 or 4 adverse events that were reported in more than 10% of the patients in either group were neutropenia (59.3% in the ribociclib group vs. 0.9% in the placebo group) and leukopenia (21.0% vs. 0.6%); the rates of discontinuation because of adverse events were 7.5% and 2.1%, respectively. Among patients receiving initial systemic treatment for HR-positive, HER2-negative advanced breast cancer, the duration of progression-free survival was significantly longer among those receiving ribociclib plus letrozole than among those receiving placebo plus letrozole, with a higher rate of myelosuppression in the ribociclib group.

The combination of antiestrogen therapy and ribociclib, an investigational CDK4/6 inhibitor, led to improved outcomes in women with metastatic HR-positive, HER2-negative breast cancer, according to findings presented at a meeting of the European Society for Medical Oncology. The combination significantly increased progression-free survival compared with letrozole alone in a large phase III trial-data that could lead to FDA approval.

Ribociclib (an oral, highly specific cyclin-dependent kinase 4/6 inhibitor) inhibits tumor growth in preclinical models with intact retinoblastoma protein (Rb<sup>+</sup>). This first-in-human study investigated the MTD, recommended dose for expansion (RDE), safety, preliminary activity, pharmacokinetics, and pharmacodynamics of ribociclib in patients with Rb<sup>+</sup> advanced solid tumors or lymphomas. Patients received escalating doses of ribociclib (3-weeks-on/1-week-off or continuous). Dose escalation was guided by a Bayesian Logistic Regression Model with overdose control principle. Among 132 patients, 125 received ribociclib 3-weeks-on/1-week-off and 7 were dosed continuously. Nine dose-limiting toxicities were observed among 70 MTD/RDE evaluable patients during cycle 1, most commonly neutropenia (n = 3) and thrombocytopenia (n = 2). The MTD and RDE were established as 900 and 600 mg/day 3-weeks-on/1-week-off, respectively. Common treatment-related adverse events were (all-grade; grade 3/4) neutropenia (46%; 27%), leukopenia (43%; 17%), fatigue (45%; 2%), and nausea (42%; 2%). Asymptomatic Fridericia's corrected QT prolongation was specific to doses â¥600 mg/day (9% of patients at 600 mg/day; 33% at doses >600 mg/day). Plasma exposure increases were slightly higher than dose proportional; mean half-life at the RDE was 32.6 hours. Reduced Ki67 was observed in paired skin and tumor biopsies, consistent with ribociclib-mediated antiproliferative activity. There were 3 partial responses and 43 patients achieved a best response of stable disease; 8 patients were progression-free for >6 months. Ribociclib demonstrated an acceptable safety profile, dose-dependent plasma exposure, and preliminary signs of clinical activity. Phase I-III studies of ribociclib are under way in various indications. Clin Cancer Res; 22(23); 5696-705. Â©2016 AACR.

Deregulation of the cyclin-dependent kinase (CDK) 4/6-retinoblastoma (RB) axis can occur through a number of mechanisms and contributes towards the unrestrained growth witnessed in a variety of cancers including breast cancers. Recent years have seen the development of selective CDK4/6 inhibitors, which have delivered promising preclinical and clinical results in breast cancer and other tumours. A number of trials assessing antitumour efficacy in various disease settings and combinations are ongoing. The cyclin D1-CDK-Rb axis and its role in the cell cycle of normal and cancer cells are delineated. The early pan-CDK inhibitor flavopiridol and subsequent preclinical and clinical development of selective CDK4/6 inhibitors are described. Ongoing studies in breast cancer with novel CDK4/6 inhibitors (palbociclib, abemaciclib and ribociclib) are explored. A literature search of these topics was performed through PubMed. Abstracts from major oncology meetings were also reviewed. Selective CDK4/6 inhibitors, as represented by the competing compounds currently in clinical development, comprise a novel, safe and, thus far, promisingly efficacious group of drugs. Considerable resources are being devoted towards exploring the efficacy of these drugs in combination with endocrine therapies, an approach that has yielded encouraging results and accelerated approval by the US Food and Drugs Administration for one of these agents (palbociclib). The results of confirmatory phase 3 trials are, however, awaited. We discuss further therapy combinations in development and highlight potential areas for caution including the potential for antagonistic interactions with cytotoxic chemotherapies.

Cyclins and cyclin-dependent protein kinases (CDKs) are important regulatory components that are required for cell cycle progression. The levels of the cell cycle CDKs are generally constant and their activities are controlled by cyclins, proteins whose levels oscillate during each cell cycle. Additional CDK family members were subsequently discovered that play significant roles in a wide range of activities including the control of gene transcription, metabolism, and neuronal function. In response to mitogenic stimuli, cells in the G1 phase of the cell cycle produce cyclins of the D type that activate CDK4/6. These activated enzymes catalyze the monophosphorylation of the retinoblastoma protein. Then CDK2-cyclin E catalyzes the hyperphosphorylation of Rb that promotes the release and activation of the E2F transcription factors, which in turn lead to the generation of several proteins required for cell cycle progression. As a result, cells pass through the G1-restriction point and are committed to complete cell division. CDK2-cyclin A, CDK1-cyclin A, and CDK1-cyclin B are required for S, G2, and M-phase progression. Increased cyclin or CDK expression or decreased levels of endogenous CDK inhibitors such as INK4 or CIP/KIP have been observed in various cancers. In contrast to the mutational activation of EGFR, Kit, or B-Raf in the pathogenesis of malignancies, mutations in the CDKs that cause cancers are rare. Owing to their role in cell proliferation, CDKs represent natural targets for anticancer therapies. Abemaciclib (LY2835219), ribociclib (Lee011), and palbociclib (Ibrance(Â®) or PD0332991) target CDK4/6 with IC50 values in the low nanomolar range. Palbociclib and other CDK inhibitors bind in the cleft between the small and large lobes of the CDKs and inhibit the binding of ATP. Like ATP, palbociclib forms hydrogen bonds with residues in the hinge segment of the cleft. Like the adenine base of ATP, palbociclib interacts with catalytic spine residues CS6 and CS7. CDK antagonists are in clinical trials for the treatment of a variety of malignancies. Significantly, palbociclib has been approved by the FDA for the treatment of hormone-receptor positive/human epidermal growth factor receptor-2 negative breast cancer in conjunction with letrozole as a first-line therapy and with fulvestrant as a second-line treatment. As inhibitors of the cell cycle, it is not surprising that one of their most common toxicities is myelosuppression with decreased neutrophil production.

Cyclin D-cyclin-dependent kinase (CDK) 4/6-inhibitor of CDK4/6-retinoblastoma (Rb) pathway hyperactivation is associated with hormone receptor-positive (HR+) breast cancer (BC). This study assessed the biological activity of ribociclib (LEE011; CDK4/6 inhibitor) plus letrozole compared with single-agent letrozole in the presurgical setting. Postmenopausal women (NÂ =Â 14) with resectable, HR+, human epidermal growth factor receptor 2-negative (HER2-) early BC were randomized 1:1:1 to receive 2.5Â mg/day letrozole alone (Arm 1), or with 400 or 600Â mg/day ribociclib (Arm 2 or 3). Circulating tumor DNA and tumor biopsies were collected at baseline and, following 14 days of treatment, prior to or during surgery. The primary objective was to assess antiproliferative response per Ki67 levels in Arms 2 and 3 compared with Arm 1. Additional assessments included safety, pharmacokinetics, and genetic profiling. Mean decreases in the Ki67-positive cell fraction from baseline were: Arm 1 69% (range 38-100%; nÂ =Â 2), Arm 2 96% (range 78-100%; nÂ =Â 6), Arm 3 92% (range 75-100%; nÂ =Â 3). Decreased phosphorylated Rb levels and CDK4, CDK6, CCND2, CCND3, and CCNE1 gene expression were observed following ribociclib treatment. Ribociclib and letrozole pharmacokinetic parameters were consistent with single-agent data. The ribociclib plus letrozole combination was well tolerated, with no Grade 3/4 adverse events over the treatment. The results suggest absence of a drug-drug interaction between ribociclib and letrozole and indicate ribociclib plus letrozole may reduce Ki67 expression in HR+, HER2- BC (NCT01919229).

Several selective CDK4/6 inhibitors are in clinical trials for non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). Palbociclib (PD0332991) is included in the phase II/III Lung-MAP trial for squamous cell lung carcinoma (LUSQ). We noted differential cellular activity between palbociclib and the structurally related ribociclib (LEE011) in LUSQ cells. Applying an unbiased mass spectrometry-based chemoproteomics approach in H157 cells and primary tumor samples, we here report distinct proteome-wide target profiles of these two drug candidates in LUSQ, which encompass novel protein and, for palbociclib only, lipid kinases. In addition to CDK4 and 6, we observed CDK9 as a potent target of both drugs. Palbociclib interacted with several kinases not targeted by ribociclib, such as casein kinase 2 and PIK3R4, which regulate autophagy. Furthermore, palbociclib engaged several lipid kinases, most notably, PIK3CD and PIP4K2A/B/C. Accordingly, we observed modulation of autophagy and inhibition of AKT signaling by palbociclib but not ribociclib.

Treatment of metastatic breast cancer (MBC) that is resistant to endocrine therapy presents a significant clinical challenge. The well-known role of cell cycle dysregulation in these patients is partly mediated by cyclin-dependent kinase (CDK) activity. Specific cyclin and CDK complexes regulate cell cycle progression by managing the transition through the cell cycle, and inhibition of CDKs represents an important target for novel agents. First-generation CDK inhibitors (e.g., flavopiridol) were relatively nonselective and had an unacceptable toxicity profile in early trials. Second-generation CDK inhibitors were designed to target the CDK4 and CDK6 (CDK4/6) pathway and have shown promising clinical activity with an acceptable toxicity profile in patients with MBC. Palbociclib is a first-in-class CDK4/6 inhibitor that was granted accelerated U.S. Food and Drug Administration approval in combination with letrozole for the treatment of MBC in the first-line setting (February 2015) as well as in combination with fulvestrant for MBC that had progressed on previous endocrine therapy (February 2016). Other CDK4/6 inhibitors, including ribociclib and abemaciclib, are under investigation as monotherapy and in combination with endocrine or anti-human epidermal growth receptor 2 therapy for the treatment of MBC. Ongoing clinical trials should provide additional information to guide the appropriate use of these agents and identify patient populations that could derive the most benefit.

Imbalance of the cyclin D and cyclin-dependent kinase (CDK) pathway in cancer cells may result in diversion away from a pathway to senescence and toward a more proliferative phenotype. Cancer cells may increase cyclin D-dependent activity through a variety of mechanisms. Therapeutic inhibition of CDKs in tumors to negate their evasion of growth suppressors has been identified as a key anticancer strategy. In this review, we outline the development of CDK inhibitory therapy in breast cancer, including the initial experience with the pan-CDK inhibitor flavopiridol and the next generation of oral highly selective CDK4 and CDK6 inhibitors PD0332991 (palbociclib), LEE011 (ribociclib), and LY2835219 (abemaciclib). Data from phase I and II studies in estrogen receptor-positive (ER+) breast cancer demonstrate promising efficacy with manageable toxic effects, chiefly neutropenia. We discuss these studies and the phase III studies that are accruing or nearing completion. We describe the application of such therapy to other breast cancer settings, including HER2-positive breast cancer and the adjuvant treatment of early breast cancer. We also discuss potential concerns surrounding the combination of CDK inhibitors with chemotherapy and their effects on repair of double-strand DNA breaks in cancer cells. Oral highly selective CDK inhibitors show great promise in improving the outcomes of patients with ER+ breast cancer, although caution must apply to their combination with other agents and in the early breast cancer setting.

Dysregulation of the cyclin D-cyclin-dependent kinase (CDK) 4/6-INK4-retinoblastoma (Rb) pathway is an important contributor to endocrine therapy resistance. Recent clinical development of selective inhibitors of CDK4 and CDK6 kinases has led to renewed interest in cell cycle regulators, following experience with relatively non-selective pan-CDK inhibitors that often resulted in limited activity and poor safety profiles in the clinic. The highly selective oral CDK 4/6 inhibitors palbociclib (PD0332991), ribociclib (LEE011), and abemaciclib (LY2835219) are able to inhibit the proliferation of Rb-positive tumor cells and have demonstrated dose-dependent growth inhibition in ER+ breast cancer models. In metastatic breast cancer, all three agents are being explored in combination with endocrine therapy in Phase III studies. Results so far indicated promising efficacy and manageable safety profiles, and led to the FDA approval of palbociclib. Phase II-III studies of these agents, in combination with endocrine therapy, are also underway in early breast cancer in the neoadjuvant and adjuvant settings. Selective CDK 4/6 inhibitors are also being investigated with other targeted agents or chemotherapy in the advanced setting. This article reviews the rationale for targeting cyclin D-CDK 4/6 in hormone receptor-positive (HR+) breast cancer, provides an overview of the available preclinical and clinical data with CDK 4/6 inhibitors in breast cancer to date, and summarizes the main features of ongoing clinical trials of these new agents in breast cancer. Future trials evaluating further combination strategies with CDK 4/6 backbone and translational studies refining predictive biomarkers are needed to help personalize the optimal treatment regimen for individual patients with ER+ breast cancer.
