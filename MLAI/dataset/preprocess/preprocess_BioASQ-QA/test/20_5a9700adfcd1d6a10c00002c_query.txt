Sclerostin regulates what process?

[PMID: 20043874]
Sclerostin, a secreted glycoprotein, regulates osteoblast function. Using yeast two-hybrid and direct protein interaction analyses, we demonstrate that sclerostin binds the Wnt-modulating and Wnt-modulated, extracellular matrix protein, cysteine-rich protein 61 (Cyr61, CCN1), which regulates mesenchymal stem cell proliferation and differentiation, osteoblast and osteoclast function, and angiogenesis. Sclerostin was shown to inhibit Cyr61-mediated fibroblast attachment, and Cyr61 together with sclerostin increases vascular endothelial cell migration and increases osteoblast cell division. The data show that sclerostin binds to and influences the activity of Cyr61.

The glycoprotein sclerostin (Scl; 22 kDa), which is involved in bone metabolism, may play a role in vascular calcification in haemodialysis (HD) patients. In the present study, we investigated the relation between serum Scl (sScl) and mortality. The effects of dialysis modality and the magnitude of the convection volume in haemodiafiltration (HDF) on sScl were also investigated. In a subset of patients from the CONTRAST study, a randomized controlled trial comparing HDF with HD, sScl was measured at baseline and at intervals of 6, 12, 24 and 36 months. Patients were divided into quartiles, according to their baseline sScl. The relation between time-varying sScl and mortality with a 4-year follow-up period was investigated using crude and adjusted Cox regression models. Linear mixed models were used for longitudinal measurements of sScl. The mean (±standard deviation) age of 396 test subjects was 63.6 (±13.9 years), 61.6% were male and the median follow-up was 2.9 years. Subjects with the highest sScl had a lower mortality risk than those with the lowest concentrations [adjusted hazard ratio 0.51 (95% confidence interval, CI, 0.31-0.86, P = 0.01)]. Stratified models showed a stable sScl in patients treated with HD (Δ +2.9 pmol/L/year, 95% CI -0.5 to +6.3, P = 0.09) and a decreasing concentration in those treated with HDF (Δ -4.5 pmol/L/year, 95% CI -8.0 to -0.9, P = 0.02). The relative change in the latter group was related to the magnitude of the convection volume. (i) A high sScl is associated with a lower mortality risk in patients with end-stage kidney disease; (ii) treatment with HDF causes sScl to fall; and (iii) the relative decline in patients treated with HDF is dependent on the magnitude of the convection volume.

Sclerostin is a Wnt pathway antagonist regulating osteoblast activity and bone turnover, and it plays a role in cardiovascular calcification processes. Previous findings indicate that sclerostin regulation is disturbed in chronic kidney disease (CKD). The aim of this study was to assess the association of circulating sclerostin levels with mortality in dialysis patients. From a prospective cohort study of incident dialysis patients in the Netherlands, all patients with measured circulating sclerostin at 3 months after the start of dialysis (baseline) were included in the present analysis: n = 673, age 63 ± 14 years, mean serum sclerostin (ELISA) 1.24 ± 0.57 ng/mL. By Cox regression analyses, we assessed the association of sclerostin levels with cardiovascular and non-cardiovascular mortality both in the short (18 months) and long term (4-year follow-up). Serum sclerostin levels in the entire cohort correlated with intact parathyroid hormone levels (r = -0.25, P < 0.001), age (r = 0.16, P < 0.001) and serum alkaline phosphatase (r = -0.13, P = 0.001). After adjustment for various clinical and biochemical parameters, patients in the highest sclerostin tertile had a significantly lower risk of cardiovascular death [hazard ratio 0.29, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.13-0.62] and for all-cause mortality (0.39, 95% CI 0.22-0.68) within 18 months compared with patients of the lowest tertile. The association of sclerostin levels with outcome was less pronounced for long-term cardiovascular mortality and absent for non-cardiovascular mortality. High levels of serum sclerostin are associated with lower short-term cardiovascular mortality in dialysis patients. The exact mechanisms of this association, e.g. how sclerostin influences or reflects uraemic vascular calcification, need to be investigated in further studies.

The osteocyte product sclerostin is emerging as an important paracrine regulator of bone mass. It has recently been shown that osteocyte production of receptor activator of NF-κB ligand (RANKL) is important in osteoclastic bone resorption, and we reported that exogenous treatment of osteocytes with sclerostin can increase RANKL-mediated osteoclast activity. There is good evidence that osteocytes can themselves liberate mineral from bone in a process known as osteocytic osteolysis. In the current study, we investigated sclerostin-stimulated mineral dissolution by human primary osteocyte-like cells (hOCy) and mouse MLO-Y4 cells. We found that sclerostin upregulated osteocyte expression of carbonic anhydrase 2 (CA2/Car2), cathepsin K (CTSK/Ctsk), and tartrate-resistant acid phosphatase (ACP5/Acp5). Because acidification of the extracellular matrix is a critical step in the release of mineral from bone, we further examined the regulation by sclerostin of CA2. Sclerostin stimulated CA2 mRNA and protein expression in hOCy and in MLO-Y4 cells. Sclerostin induced a decrease in intracellular pH (pHi) in both cell types as well as a decrease in extracellular pH (pHo) and the release of calcium ions from mineralized substrate. These effects were reversed in the co-presence of the carbonic anhydrase inhibitor, acetozolamide. Car2-siRNA knockdown in MLO-Y4 cells significantly inhibited the ability of sclerostin to both reduce the pHo and release calcium from a mineralized substrate. Knockdown in MLO-Y4 cells of each of the putative sclerostin receptors, Lrp4, Lrp5 and Lrp6, using siRNA, inhibited the sclerostin induction of Car2, Catk and Acp5 mRNA, as well as pHo and calcium release. Consistent with this activity of sclerostin resulting in osteocytic osteolysis, human trabecular bone samples treated ex vivo with recombinant human sclerostin for 7 days exhibited an increased osteocyte lacunar area, an effect that was reversed by the co-addition of acetozolamide. These findings suggest a new role for sclerostin in the regulation of perilacunar mineral by osteocytes.

Sclerostin regulates bone formation by inhibiting Wnt pathway signaling. Low circulating sclerostin levels cause high bone mass. We hypothesized that postmenopausal women with increased sclerostin levels have a greater risk for osteoporosis-related fractures. We examined the association between circulating sclerostin together with bone turnover markers and osteoporosis-related fracture risk in 707 postmenopausal women, in a population-based study with a mean follow-up period of 5.2 ± 1.3 years. Multivariate Cox proportional hazards regression models were used to analyze fracture risk, adjusted for age, body mass index, and other confounding risk factors. High sclerostin levels were strongly associated with increased fracture risk. After adjustment for age and other confounders, the relative fracture risk was more than sevenfold among postmenopausal women for each 1-SD increment increase in sclerostin level. Women in the highest quartile of sclerostin levels had about a 15-fold increase in fracture risk. Results were similar when we compared sclerostin at the 1-year visit to an average of two to three annual measurements. Fracture risk attributable to sclerostin levels was 56.6% in the highest quartile. Only high levels of bone resorption markers (plasma cross-linked C-terminal telopeptide of type 1 collagen [p-CTx], urinary CTx [u-CTx], and urinary N-telopeptide of type 1 collagen [u-NTx]) were predictive of osteoporosis-related fractures but at much lower hazard ratio (HR) values than that of serum sclerostin. Associations between sclerostin levels and fracture risk were independent of bone mineral density and other confounding risk factors. High sclerostin levels are a strong and independent risk factor for osteoporosis-related fractures among postmenopausal women. © 2012 American Society for Bone and Mineral Research.

In humans, the SOST gene encodes sclerostin, an inhibitor of bone growth and remodeling, which also negatively regulates the bone repair process. Sclerostin has also been implicated in tooth formation, but its potential role in pulp healing remains unknown. The aim of this study was to explore the role of sclerostin in reparative dentinogenesis using Sost knockout mice ( Sost<sup>-/-</sup>). The pulps of the first maxillary molars were mechanically exposed in 3-mo-old Sost<sup>-/-</sup> and wild-type (WT) mice ( n = 14 mice per group), capped with mineral trioxide aggregate cement, and the cavities were filled with a bonded composite resin. Reparative dentinogenesis was dynamically followed up by micro-computed tomography and characterized by histological analyses. Presurgical analysis revealed a significantly lower pulp volume in Sost<sup>-/-</sup> mice compared with WT. At 30 and 49 d postsurgery, a large-forming reparative mineralized bridge, associated with osteopontin-positive mineralization foci, was observed in the Sost<sup>-/-</sup> pulps, whereas a much smaller bridge was detected in WT. At the longer time points, the bridge, which was associated with dentin sialoprotein-positive cells, had expanded in both groups but remained significantly larger in Sost<sup>-/-</sup> pulps. Sclerostin expression in the healing WT pulps was detected in the cells neighboring the forming dentin bridge. In vitro, mineralization induced by Sost<sup>-/-</sup> dental pulp cells (DPCs) was also dramatically enhanced when compared with WT DPCs. These observations were associated with an increased Sost expression in WT cells. Taken together, our data show that sclerostin deficiency hastened reparative dentinogenesis after pulp injury, suggesting that the inhibition of sclerostin may constitute a promising therapeutic strategy for improving the healing of damaged pulps.

Estrogen deficiency leads to rapid bone loss and skeletal fragility. Sclerostin, encoded by the sost gene, and a product of the osteocyte, is a negative regulator of bone formation. Blocking sclerostin increases bone mass and strength in animals and humans. Sirtuin1 (Sirt1), a player in aging and metabolism, regulates bone mass and inhibits sost expression by deacetylating histone 3 at its promoter. We asked whether a Sirt1-activating compound could rescue ovariectomy (OVX)-induced bone loss and biomechanical deterioration in 9-week-old C57BL/6 mice. OVX resulted in a substantial decrease in skeletal Sirt1 expression accompanied by an increase in sclerostin. Oral administration of SRT3025, a Sirt1 activator, at 50 and 100 mg/kg·d for 6 weeks starting 6 weeks after OVX fully reversed the deleterious effects of OVX on vertebral bone mass, microarchitecture, and femoral biomechanical properties. Treatment with SRT3025 decreased bone sclerostin expression and increased cortical periosteal mineralizing surface and serum propeptide of type I procollagen, a bone formation marker. In vitro, in the murine long bone osteocyte-Y4 osteocyte-like cell line SRT3025 down-regulated sclerostin and inactive β-catenin, whereas a reciprocal effect was observed with EX-527, a Sirt1 inhibitor. Sirt1 activation by Sirt1-activating compounds is a potential novel pathway to down-regulate sclerostin and design anabolic therapies for osteoporosis concurrently ameliorating other metabolic and age-associated conditions.

TGF-β1 regulates bone metabolism and mediates bone turnover during postmenopause. Sclerostin negatively regulates Wnt signaling pathway and also has an important role in postmenopausal bone loss. Little is known about the relationship between serum TGF-β1 and sclerostin during menopause. We compared serum levels of TGF-β1 and sclerostin in pre- and postmenopausal women and assessed the potential correlations of these levels with each other and with serum levels of bone turnover markers and bone mineral density. A total of 176 women (58 premenopausal, 62 early postmenopausal, and 56 late postmenopausal) were included in this study. Serum TGF-β1 level was significantly higher in early postmenopausal women compared with premenopausal (32.0±7.19 vs. 26.55±6.67 ng/ml, p=0.01) and late postmenopausal (32.0±7.19 vs. 28.65±7.70 pg/ml, p=0.031) women, and no significant differences in serum sclerostin levels were observed among the 3 groups. There was a significant negative correlation between TGF-β1 and sclerostin in early postmenopausal women, but not in other groups of women. Based on multiple regression analysis, only TGF-β1 (β=-0.362; p=0.007) was an independent predictor of sclerostin during early postmenopause. Our findings suggest that serum TGF-β1 level increases during postmenopause and declines in old age. Sclerostin production is inhibited by TGF-β1 during early postmenopause.

Sclerostin is a key negative regulator of bone formation. It was hypothesized that sclerostin might also play a potential role in the development of aortic valve calcification (AVC). The study aim was to evaluate serum sclerostin levels in patients with different degrees of AVC compared to a healthy control group, and to investigate local sclerostin expression in explanted calcified and non-calcified aortic valves. A prospective cross-sectional study was performed in 115 patients (mean age 74 +/- 7 years) with echocardiographically proven AVC. Sclerostin serum levels were measured using ELISA and compared to values obtained from a healthy control population. For quantification of AVC, all patients of the study cohort underwent non-contrast-enhanced dual-source computed tomography (DSCT). Immunohistochemistry (IHC) staining for sclerostin and mRNA sclerostin expression was analyzed in 10 calcified aortic valves and 10 non-calcified age-matched control valves. Patients with AVC showed significantly higher sclerostin serum levels as compared to healthy controls (0.94 +/- 0.45 versus 0.58 +/- 0.26 ng/ml, p < 0.001). A significant correlation between sclerostin serum levels and Agatston AVC scores as assessed by DSCT was observed (r = 0.62, p < 0.001) in the study cohort. IHC revealed positive sclerostin staining in nine calcified valves, in contrast to negative staining for sclerostin in all non-calcified valves. Quantitative real-time PCR confirmed the increased sclerostin expression on mRNA level, with a significant up-regulation of sclerostin mRNA (fold change 150 +/- 52, p < 0.001) expression being shown in calcified aortic valves compared to non-calcified control valves. Co-staining experiments revealed that sclerostin-expressing cells co-express the major osteogenic transcription factor Runx2 and the extracellular matrix protein osteocalcin. Patients with AVC showed increased sclerostin serum levels compared to a healthy reference population, and it was revealed that the severity of AVC may be linked to increased sclerostin serum levels. Moreover, the PCR and staining data demonstrated an increased sclerostin expression in parallel to prototypic markers of osteogenic transdifferentiation, indicating a role of sclerostin in the valvular calcification process.

The secreted glycoprotein, sclerostin alters bone formation. To gain insights into the mechanism of action of sclerostin, we examined the interactions of sclerostin with bone proteins using a sclerostin affinity capture technique. Proteins from decalcified rat bone were captured on a sclerostin-maltose binding protein (MBP) amylose column, or on a MBP amylose column. The columns were extensively washed with low ionic strength buffer, and bound proteins were eluted with buffer containing 1M sodium chloride. Eluted proteins were separated by denaturing sodium-dodecyl sulfate gel electrophoresis and were identified by mass spectrometry. Several previously unidentified full-length sclerostin-interacting proteins such as alkaline phosphatase, carbonic anhydrase, gremlin-1, fetuin A, midkine, annexin A1 and A2, and collagen α1, which have established roles in bone formation or resorption processes, were bound to the sclerostin-MBP amylose resin but not to the MBP amylose resin. Other full-length sclerostin-interacting proteins such as casein kinase II and secreted frizzled related protein 4 that modulate Wnt signaling were identified. Several peptides derived from proteins such as Phex, asporin and follistatin that regulate bone metabolism also bound sclerostin. Sclerostin interacts with multiple proteins that alter bone formation and resorption and is likely to function by altering several biologically relevant pathways in bone.

After discovering that lack of Sost/sclerostin expression is the cause of the high bone mass human syndromes Van Buchem disease and sclerosteosis, extensive animal experimentation and clinical studies demonstrated that sclerostin plays a critical role in bone homeostasis and that its deficiency or pharmacological neutralization increases bone formation. Dysregulation of sclerostin expression also underlies the pathophysiology of skeletal disorders characterized by loss of bone mass, as well as the damaging effects of some cancers in bone. Thus, sclerostin has quickly become a promising molecular target for the treatment of osteoporosis and other skeletal diseases, and beneficial skeletal outcomes are observed in animal studies and clinical trials using neutralizing antibodies against sclerostin. However, the anabolic effect of blocking sclerostin decreases with time, bone mass accrual is also accompanied by anti-catabolic effects, and there is bone loss over time after therapy discontinuation. Further, the cellular source of sclerostin in the bone/bone marrow microenvironment under physiological and pathological conditions, the pathways that regulate sclerostin expression and the mechanisms by which sclerostin modulates the activity of osteocytes, osteoblasts, and osteoclasts remain unclear. In this review, we highlight the current knowledge on the regulation of Sost/sclerotin expression and its mechanism(s) of action, discuss novel observations regarding its role in signaling pathways activated by hormones and mechanical stimuli in bone, and propose future research needed to understand the full potential of therapeutic interventions that modulate Sost/sclerostin expression.

The Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway plays an essential role in osteoblast biology. Sclerostin is a soluble antagonist of Wnt/β-catenin signaling secreted primarily by osteocytes. Current evidence indicates that sclerostin likely functions as a local/paracrine regulator of bone metabolism rather than as an endocrine hormone. Nonetheless, circulating sclerostin levels in humans often reflect changes in the bone microenvironment, although there may be exceptions to this observation. Using existing assays, circulating sclerostin levels have been shown to be altered in response to both hormonal stimuli and across a variety of normal physiological and pathophysiological conditions. In both rodents and humans, parathyroid hormone provided either intermittently or continuously suppresses sclerostin levels. Likewise, most evidence from both human and animal studies supports a suppressive effect of estrogen on sclerostin levels. Efforts to examine non-hormonal/systemic regulation of sclerostin have in general shown less consistent findings or have provided associations rather than direct interventional information, with the exception of mechanosensory studies which have consistently demonstrated increased sclerostin levels with skeletal unloading, and conversely decreases in sclerostin with enhanced skeletal loading. Herein, we will review the existent literature on both hormonal and non-hormonal/systemic factors which have been studied for their impact on sclerostin regulation.

Sclerosteosis is a progressive sclerosing bone dysplasia. Sclerostin (the SOST gene) was originally identified as the sclerosteosis-causing gene. However, the physiological role of sclerostin remains to be elucidated. Sclerostin was intensely expressed in developing bones of mouse embryos. Punctuated expression of sclerostin was localized on the surfaces of both intramembranously forming skull bones and endochondrally forming long bones. Sclerostin-positive cells were identified as osteoclasts. Recombinant sclerostin protein produced in cultured cells was efficiently secreted as a monomer. We examined effects of sclerostin on the activity of BMP2, BMP4, BMP6, and BMP7 for mouse preosteoblastic MC3T3-E1 cells. Sclerostin inhibited the BMP6 and BMP7 activity but not the BMP2 and BMP4 activity. Sclerostin bound to BMP6 and BMP7 with high affinity but bound to BMP2 and BMP4 with lower affinity. In conclusion, sclerostin is a novel secreted osteoclast-derived BMP antagonist with unique ligand specificity. We suggest that sclerostin negatively regulates the formation of bone by repressing the differentiation and/or function of osteoblasts induced by BMPs. Since sclerostin expression is confined to the bone-resorbing osteoclast, it provides a mechanism whereby bone apposition is inhibited in the vicinity of resorption. Our findings indicate that sclerostin plays an important role in bone remodeling and links bone resorption and bone apposition.

Sclerostin plays a major role in regulating skeletal bone mass, but its effects in articular cartilage are not known. The purpose of this study was to determine whether genetic loss or pharmacologic inhibition of sclerostin has an impact on knee joint articular cartilage. Expression of sclerostin was determined in articular cartilage and bone tissue obtained from mice, rats, and human subjects, including patients with knee osteoarthritis (OA). Mice with genetic knockout (KO) of sclerostin and pharmacologic inhibition of sclerostin with a sclerostin-neutralizing monoclonal antibody (Scl-Ab) in aged male rats and ovariectomized (OVX) female rats were used to study the effects of sclerostin on pathologic processes in the knee joint. The rat medial meniscus tear (MMT) model of OA was used to investigate the pharmacologic efficacy of systemic Scl-Ab or intraarticular (IA) delivery of a sclerostin antibody-Fab (Scl-Fab) fragment. Sclerostin expression was detected in rodent and human articular chondrocytes. No difference was observed in the magnitude or distribution of sclerostin expression between normal and OA cartilage or bone. Sclerostin-KO mice showed no difference in histopathologic features of the knee joint compared to age-matched wild-type mice. Pharmacologic treatment of intact aged male rats or OVX female rats with Scl-Ab had no effect on morphologic characteristics of the articular cartilage. In the rat MMT model, pharmacologic treatment of animals with either systemic Scl-Ab or IA injection of Scl-Fab had no effect on lesion development or severity. Genetic absence of sclerostin does not alter the normal development of age-dependent OA in mice, and pharmacologic inhibition of sclerostin with Scl-Ab has no impact on articular cartilage remodeling in rats with posttraumatic OA.

Insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF-1) is a determinant of bone mass and is inversely associated with vertebral fractures (VFs). Sclerostin regulates bone formation by inhibiting Wnt/β-catenin signaling. Currently, there is little information on circulating sclerostin levels among postmenopausal women with type-2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) with VFs in relation to serum IGF-1 (s-IGF-1). We investigated the relationships between serum sclerostin, s-IGF-1, and VFs in postmenopausal women with T2DM. We assessed cross-sectionally 482 postmenopausal women with T2DM and 482 age-matched postmenopausal women without T2DM who were recruited at diabetic clinics and primary health care centers for inclusion in a bone health survey. The main outcome measures were serum sclerostin, s-IGF-1, bone mineral density (BMD), and bone turnover markers. Lateral X-rays of the thoracic and lumbar spine were taken to diagnose VFs. Serum sclerostin levels were increased, whereas s-IGF-1 levels were decreased when T2DM women were stratified by the number of VFs (P<0.0001). Multiple logistic regression analysis showed that serum sclerostin levels were positively associated with 1 VF (odds ratio [OR]=1.27, (95% CI:1.01-2.03), P=0.016), 2 VFs (OR=1.41, (95% CI:1.03-2.36), P=0.006), and ≥3 VFs (OR=1.54, (95% CI:1.12-2.44) P=0.005). s-IGF-1 levels were inversely associated with 1 VF (OR=0.58, (95% CI:0.39-0.88), P=0.041), 2 VFs (OR=0.42, (95% CI:0.21-0.90), P=0.012), and ≥3 VFs (OR=0.19, (95% CI: 0.14-0.27), P<0.001). Increased serum sclerostin and decreased s-IGF-1 were associated with VFs among postmenopausal women with T2DM, suggesting that sclerostin and/or IGF-1 may be involved in increased bone fragility in T2DM and could be potential markers of VF severity.

Sclerostin is a product of mature osteocytes embedded in mineralised bone and is a negative regulator of bone mass and osteoblast differentiation. While evidence suggests that sclerostin has an anti-anabolic role, the possibility also exists that sclerostin has catabolic activity. To test this we treated human primary pre-osteocyte cultures, cells we have found are exquisitely sensitive to sclerostin, or mouse osteocyte-like MLO-Y4 cells, with recombinant human sclerostin (rhSCL) and measured effects on pro-catabolic gene expression. Sclerostin dose-dependently up-regulated the expression of receptor activator of nuclear factor kappa B (RANKL) mRNA and down-regulated that of osteoprotegerin (OPG) mRNA, causing an increase in the RANK:OPG mRNA ratio. To examine the effects of rhSCL on resulting osteoclastic activity, MLO-Y4 cells plated onto a bone-like substrate were primed with rhSCL for 3 days and then either mouse splenocytes or human peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) were added. This resulted in cultures with elevated osteoclastic resorption (approximately 7-fold) compared to untreated co-cultures. The increased resorption was abolished by co-addition of recombinant OPG. In co-cultures of MLO-Y4 cells with PBMC, SCL also increased the number and size of the TRAP-positive multinucleated cells formed. Importantly, rhSCL had no effect on TRAP-positive cell formation from monocultures of either splenocytes or PBMC. Further, rhSCL did not induce apoptosis of MLO-Y4 cells, as determined by caspase activity assays, demonstrating that the osteoclastic response was not driven by dying osteocytes. Together, these results suggest that sclerostin may have a catabolic action through promotion of osteoclast formation and activity by osteocytes, in a RANKL-dependent manner.

Tooth movement is a biological process of bone remodeling induced by mechanical force. Sclerostin secreted by osteocytes is mechanosensory and important in bone remodeling. However, little is known regarding the role of sclerostin in tooth movement. In this study, models of experimental tooth movement were established in rats and mice. Sclerostin expression was investigated with immunohistochemistry staining, and osteoclastic activity was analyzed with tartrate-resistant acid phosphatase (TRAP) staining. MLO-Y4 osteocyte-like cells underwent uniaxial compression and tension stress or were cultured in hypoxia conditions. Expression of sclerostin was assessed by RT-qPCR and ELISA. MLO-Y4 cells were cultured with recombinant human sclerostin (rhSCL) interference and then co-cultured with RAW264.7 osteoclast precursor cells. Expressions of RANKL and OPG were analyzed by RT-qPCR, and osteoclastic activity was assessed by TRAP staining. During tooth movement, sclerostin was expressed differently in compression and tension sites. In SOST knock-out mice, there were significantly fewer TRAP-positive cells than in WT mice during tooth movement in compression sites. In-vitro studies showed that the expression of sclerostin in MLO-Y4 osteocyte-like cells was not different under a uniaxial compression and tension force, whereas hypoxia conditions significantly increased sclerostin expression in MLO-Y4 cells. rhSCL interference increased the expression of RANKL and the RANKL/OPG ratio in MLO-Y4 cells and the osteoclastic induction ability of MLO-Y4 cells in experimental osteocyte-osteoclast co-culture. These data suggest that sclerostin plays an important role in the bone remodeling of tooth movement.

Sclerostin, an osteocyte-expressed negative regulator of bone formation, is one of the inhibitors of Wnt signaling that is a critical pathway in the correct process of osteoblast differentiation. It has been demonstrated that Wnt signaling through the secretion of Wnt inhibitors, such as DKK1, sFRP-2, and sFRP-3, plays a key role in the decreased osteoblast activity associated with multiple myeloma (MM) bone disease. We provide evidence that sclerostin is expressed by myeloma cells that are human myeloma cell lines and plasma cells (CD138(+) cells) obtained from the bone marrow (BM) of a large number of MM patients with bone disease. Moreover, we show that there are no differences in sclerostin serum levels between MM patients and controls. Thus, our data indicate that MM cells, as a sclerostin source in the BM, could create a microenvironment with high sclerostin concentration that could contribute toward inhibiting osteoblast differentiation.

Sclerostin is a secreted inhibitor of Wnt signaling and plays an essential role in the regulation of bone mass. The expression of sclerostin is largely restricted to osteocytes although its mode of transcriptional regulation is not well understood. We observed regulated expression of sclerostin mRNA and protein that was directly correlated with the mineralization response in cultured human Saos-2 osteosarcoma cells and rat primary calvarial cells. Sclerostin mRNA and protein levels were increased following treatment of cells with BMP2, BMP4 and BMP7. Analysis of deletion mutants from the -7.4 kb upstream region of the human sclerostin promoter did not reveal any specific regions that were responsive to BMPs, Wnt3a, PTH, TGFβ1 or Activin A in Saos-2 cells. The downstream ECR5 element did not show enhancer activity in Saos-2 cells and also was not affected when Saos-2 cells were treated with BMPs or PTH. Genome-wide microarray analysis of Saos-2 cells treated with BMP2 showed significant changes in expression of several transcription factors with putative consensus DNA binding sites in the region of the sclerostin promoter. However, whereas most factors tested showed either a range of inhibitory activity (DLX family, MSX2, HEY1, SMAD6/7) or lack of activity on the sclerostin promoter including SMAD9, only MEF2B showed a positive effect on both the promoter and ECR5 element. These results suggest that the dramatic induction of sclerostin gene expression by BMPs in Saos-2 cells occurs indirectly and is associated with late stage differentiation of osteoblasts and the mineralization process.

The identity of the cell type responsive to sclerostin, a negative regulator of bone mass, is unknown. Since sclerostin is expressed in vivo by mineral-embedded osteocytes, we tested the hypothesis that sclerostin would regulate the behavior of cells actively involved in mineralization in adult bone, the preosteocyte. Differentiating cultures of human primary osteoblasts exposed to recombinant human sclerostin (rhSCL) for 35 days displayed dose- and time-dependent inhibition of in vitro mineralization, with late cultures being most responsive in terms of mineralization and gene expression. Treatment of advanced (day 35) cultures with rhSCL markedly increased the expression of the preosteocyte marker E11 and decreased the expression of mature markers DMP1 and SOST. Concomitantly, matrix extracellular phosphoglycoprotein (MEPE) expression was increased by rhSCL at both the mRNA and protein levels, whereas PHEX was decreased, implying regulation through the MEPE-ASARM axis. We confirmed that mineralization by human osteoblasts is exquisitely sensitive to the triphosphorylated ASARM-PO4 peptide. Immunostaining revealed that rhSCL increased the endogenous levels of MEPE-ASARM. Importantly, antibody-mediated neutralization of endogenous MEPE-ASARM antagonized the effect of rhSCL on mineralization, as did the PHEX synthetic peptide SPR4. Finally, we found elevated Sost mRNA expression in the long bones of HYP mice, suggesting that sclerostin may drive the increased MEPE-ASARM levels and mineralization defect in this genotype. Our results suggest that sclerostin acts through regulation of the PHEX/MEPE axis at the preosteocyte stage and serves as a master regulator of physiologic bone mineralization, consistent with its localization in vivo and its established role in the inhibition of bone formation.
