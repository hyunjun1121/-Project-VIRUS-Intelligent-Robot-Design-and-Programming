Which is the prevalence of cystic fibrosis in the human population?

Cystic fibrosis (CF) is considered to be rare among individuals from the Indian subcontinent. Furthermore, affected individuals are reported to experience a more severe clinical course. It was hypothesised that CF is under diagnosed in people of South Asian origin and therefore the prevalence may be higher than previously estimated. The prevalence of CF in the South Asian and in the general population living in the same geographic region (Metropolitan Toronto) were compared between 1996 and 2001. Population data were obtained from the Canadian census survey. CF phenotype and genotype data were obtained from the Toronto CF database. Among 381 patients with CF, 15 were of South Asian descent. The age related prevalence of CF among the South Asian and general populations was: 0-14 years, 1:9200 versus 1:6600; 15-24 years, 1:13,200 versus 1:7600; older than 25 years, 1:56,600 versus 1:12,400. Age at diagnosis, duration and severity of symptoms at diagnosis, current nutritional status, and FEV(1) were similar in the two groups. While not significant, FEV1 tended to be lower (48% versus 57% predicted) among adult South Asians, compared to the general CF population. Also, the percentage with pancreatic sufficiency was higher (27% versus 16%) and the frequency of DeltaF508 allele was lower (50% versus 65.1%). These data suggest that the prevalence and natural history of CF in South Asians is similar to that among individuals of European origin. The relatively lower prevalence among older South Asians may reflect an improving recognition of CF in this ethnic subgroup.

The aim of this study was to evaluate the screening policies of cystic fibrosis (CF) in the Jewish population. The prevalence of mutations that account for CF in Israel have been defined in the past by determining the frequency of CF mutations in affected individuals. This study is a population-based study and is, therefore, different from previous patient-based studies. We found that the CF mutations D1152H, W1089X, and 405 + IG-->A were present in some ethnic groups in which no CF patients carrying these mutations were reported. These facts necessitate a reevaluation of the screening policy regarding the ethnic groups in Israel. We studied 9,430 healthy Jewish Israeli individuals of 36 countries of origin. The prevalence of CF mutations was 1:19, 1:19, 1:28, and 1:42 for the Ashkenazi, Sephardi, North African, and Eastern Jews, respectively. CF mutations were identified in 374 (4.0%) individuals. These included 173 (46.3%) carriers of the W1282X mutation; 110 (29.4%) found to carry delF508; 23 (6.1%) who carried G542X; 22 (5.9%) who carried 3849 + 10Kb (C-->T; 20 (5.3%) who carried D1152H; 10 (2.7%) who carried N1303K; 11 (2.9%) who carried 405 + IG-->A; 4 (1.1%) who carried W1089X; and one (0.3%) who carried S549R. No carriers were detected for the 1717-1G-->A, G85E, and T360K mutations, which were tested for in 7,383, 1,558, and 41 individuals, respectively.

This study combined a variety of methods to determine the prevalence of cystic fibrosis in the European Union. The results of literature reviews, surveys, and registry analyses revealed a mean prevalence of 0.737/10,000 in the 27 EU countries, which is similar to the value of 0.797 in the United States, and only one outlier, namely the Republic of Ireland at 2.98.

Cystic fibrosis is the most common hereditary disease in populations of European descent, with its prevalence depending on the populations and ethnic groups studied. In contrast to Europe and North America, there is little information about this disease in Latin America. Uruguay currently has a human population of 3,000,000, with a low rate of miscegenation and no remaining isolated Amerindian groups. In the present study, we estimated the prevalence of cystic fibrosis in this country based on the detection of DeltaF508 mutation carriers in 500 unrelated individuals and on the frequency of individuals homozygous for this mutation within the affected population. The latter was calculated from the frequency of the different mutations and genotypes observed in a sample of 52 previously described patients with confirmed cystic fibrosis. A theoretical estimate of the prevalence of cystic fibrosis based on anthropological data suggested a frequency of 25 affected individuals/100,000 inhabitants. However, our data indicated that the true prevalence in the population was considerably lower (6.9 cases/100,000 inhabitants).

This study reports on the phenotype of cystic fibrosis patients identified to be carriers of the p.Ser489X (p.Ser489*; c.1466C>A) cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) mutation, a variant rarely described in the cystic fibrosis literature, as well as on its allelic frequency in a French-Canadian cystic fibrosis patient cohort. Reported phenotypes and allelic frequency of this variant were collected based on the data from a large French-Canadian cystic fibrosis patient cohort. Cystic fibrosis patients found to carry the p.Ser489X variant generally presented with classic gastrointestinal manifestations of this condition in infancy. The allelic frequency of this variant was calculated to be 0.7% for this population. The p.Ser489X CFTR variant is a severe disease-causing CFTR allele that is relatively frequent in the French-Canadian cystic fibrosis patient population, warranting its inclusion into CFTR molecular testing panel for this population.

The epidemiology of cystic fibrosis (CF) is poorly known in North African populations, in particular in Morocco and the CF carrier frequency in the general Moroccan population has never been evaluated. To estimate the prevalence of CF mutations in Morocco, blood samples from 150 healthy Moroccans were tested for frequent CFTR mutations and the intron 8 polyT variant. Two subjects were heterozygous for F508del and eight others for the (T)5 variant. These findings indicate that the Moroccan population is at risk for CF and CFTR-related disorders. CF prevalence could be in the range of that found in European populations. Wider studies are necessary to identify the clinical pattern and accurately determine the prevalence and molecular basis of CF in Morocco.
