Fostamatinib (Tavalisse) for thrombocytopenia in adults with chronic immune thrombocytopenia; coagulation factor Xa (recombinant), inactivated-zhzo (Andexxa) for the reversal of anticoagulation; epoetin alfa-epbx (Retacrit), a biosimilar for the treatment of anemia.

The direct oral anticoagulants (DOACs) have gained popularity recently among both patients and providers for their comparable or better efficacy and safety profiles compared with warfarin and the lack of need for routine monitoring of anticoagulant effect. One obstacle for the more widespread use of the DOACs in clinical practice has been the lack of a reversal agent. Most DOACs act by directly binding to and inhibiting the effects of factor Xa. Andexanet alfa (Andexxa, Portola Pharmaceuticals, San Francisco, CA) is a modified form of factor Xa that acts as a decoy binding entity for DOACs, thereby allowing endogenous factor Xa to perform its normal clotting functions. Andexanet has proven efficacious in clinical trials for reversing the anticoagulant effects of apixaban, edoxaban, and rivaroxaban, although its impact on clinical outcomes has not been adequately studied. Andexanet has a boxed warning for thromboembolic risks, ischemic risks, cardiac arrest, and sudden death, with these adverse events occurring in up to 18% of patients in clinical trials. However, the occurrence of these adverse events needs to be considered in relation to the fragile nature of patients who receive this agent. Because the duration of the DOACs is much less than that of warfarin, it is unclear how many patients would actually need andexanet in clinical practice, because cessation of the DOAC may be all that is needed to effectively manage bleeding. Nonetheless, having andexanet available in cases of DOAC-associated severe or life-threatening bleeding represents a therapeutic advance and should provide an added level of comfort with the clinical use of DOACs.

The use of direct oral anticoagulants over traditional warfarin has increased in the United States over the past 10 years because of advantages such as ease of use, predictable pharmacokinetic response, and safety. In 2015, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration approved idarucizumab (Praxbind) for the reversal of the direct thrombin inhibitor dabigatran, but no reversal agent has been available for oral factor Xa (FXa) inhibitors until recently. Andexanet alfa was approved in May 2018, under the brand name ANDEXXA, for the reversal of 2 of FXa inhibitors, apixaban and rivaroxaban, when life-threatening or uncontrolled bleeding occurs. This accelerated approval was based on change in anti-FXa activity from baseline that indicated a reversal of the anticoagulant effect. Any expanded Food and Drug Administration indication will be contingent on results demonstrating improved hemostasis and efficacy for reversing other FXa inhibitors.

Intravenous andexanet alfa [coagulation factor Xa (recombinant), inactivated-zhzo; Andexxa<sup>®</sup>] is a first-in-class recombinant modified factor Xa protein that has been developed by Portola Pharmaceuticals as a universal antidote to reverse anticoagulant effects of direct or indirect factor Xa inhibitors. In May 2018, andexanet alfa received its first global approval in the USA for use in patients treated with rivaroxaban and apixaban, when reversal of anticoagulant effects is required in life-threatening or uncontrolled bleeding. Intravenous andexanet alfa is under regulatory review in the EU and is undergoing clinical development in Japan. This article summarizes the milestones in the development of andexanet alfa leading to this first global approval for reversing anticoagulation of rivaroxaban and apixaban in adults.

Andexanet alfa (Andexxa<sup>®</sup>), a first-in-class recombinant modified factor Xa protein, is currently the only specific agent available to reverse life-threatening or uncontrolled bleeding with the factor Xa inhibitors apixaban and rivaroxaban. Andexanet alfa acts as a decoy and competes with endogenous factor Xa to bind factor Xa inhibitors, thereby reversing the anticoagulant effects of factor Xa inhibitors, and restoring the activity of endogenous factor Xa. In adults with major bleeding associated with the use of apixaban or rivaroxaban, intravenous administration of andexanet alfa effectively and rapidly reduces anti-factor Xa levels, with reduced levels being maintained during continued treatment. The tolerability profile of andexanet alfa in patients is generally similar to that reported of other approved anticoagulation reversal agents. With the known increased risk of thromboembolic events following andexanet alfa treatment, anticoagulant therapy should be resumed as soon as medically appropriate.
