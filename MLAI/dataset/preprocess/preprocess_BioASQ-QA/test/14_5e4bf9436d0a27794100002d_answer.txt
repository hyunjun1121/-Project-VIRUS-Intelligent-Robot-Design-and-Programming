IDEAL_ANSWER:
- The Notch/Hes axis represses a cohort of transcription factor genes . In Drosophila, activation of the Notch receptor induces transcriptional repressors encoded by the hairy/Enhancer of split (HES) genes, which shut off achaete-scute transcription . The molecular details of how Hes and Hey proteins control transcription are still poorly understood .
- Hes genes encode factors that mediate many of the activities of the Notch pathway. Hes genes are functionally classified into two groups: those that are regulated by Notch and those that are not.
- Mammalian Hes genes encode transcriptional factors that mediate many of the activities of the Notch pathway. HES transcriptional repressors are important components of the Notch pathway that regulates neurogenesis from Drosophila to vertebrates.
- In Drosophila, activation of the Notch receptor induces transcriptional repressors encoded by the hairy/Enhancer of split (HES) genes, which interact with the Groucho protein to shut off achaete-scute transcription.
- Transcriptional dynamics elicited by a short pulse of notch activation involves feed-forward regulation by E(spl)/Hes genes. Mammalian Hes genes encode transcriptional factors that mediate many of the activities of the Notch pathway.
- HES transcriptional repressors are important components of the Notch pathway that regulates neurogenesis from Drosophila to vertebrates. Hes genes are responsible for co-ordinating the Notch response of a wide spectrum of other targets, explaining the critical functions these key regulators play in many developmental and disease contexts. Hes1, Hes5, and Hes7 are known as downstream effectors of canonical Notch signaling, which regulates cell differentiation via cell-cell interaction
- The Notch/Hes axis represses a cohort of transcription factor genes . The molecular details of how Hes and Hey proteins control transcription are still poorly understood . In Drosophila, activation of the Notch receptor induces transcriptional repressors encoded by the hairy/Enhancer of split (HES) genes, which act as negative regulators in this process .
- Transcriptional dynamics elicited by a short pulse of notch activation involves feed-forward regulation by E(spl)/Hes genes. Hes1, Hes5, and Hes7 are known as downstream effectors of canonical Notch signaling, which regulates cell differentiation via cell-cell interaction
- Transcriptional dynamics elicited by a short pulse of notch activation involves feed-forward regulation by E(spl)/Hes genes. Based on these data, we propose a model in which Hes genes are responsible for co-ordinating the Notch response of a wide spectrum of other targets, explaining the critical functions these key regulators play in many developmental and disease contexts.
- Mammalian Hes genes encode transcriptional factors that mediate many of the activities of the Notch pathway . Hes1, Hes5, and Hes7 are known as downstream effectors of canonical Notch signaling . The Notch-Hes1 pathway regulates ovarian somatic cell development, which is necessary for oocyte survival and maturation .
