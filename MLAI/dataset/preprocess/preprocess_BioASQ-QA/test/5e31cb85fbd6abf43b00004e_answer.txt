IDEAL_ANSWER:
- Huntington's disease (HD) is a fully penetrant neurodegenerative disease caused by a dominantly inherited CAG trinucleotide repeat expansion in the huntingtin gene HTT encoding the Huntingtin protein on chromosome 4.
- Huntington's disease (HD; OMIM 143100), a progressive neurodegenerative disorder, is caused by an expanded trinucleotide CAG (polyQ) motif in the huntingtin gene.
- (HD) is a neurodegenerative disorder that is caused by abnormal expansion of CAG repeats in the HTT gene.
- Huntington's disease (HD) is a neurodegenerative disorder that is caused by abnormal expansion of CAG repeats in the HTT gene.

EXACT_ANSWER:
- HTT gene encoding the protein huntingtin
