Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease type 4B (CMT4B) is a severe, demyelinating peripheral neuropathy characterized by distinctive, focally folded myelin sheaths. CMT4B is caused by recessively inherited mutations in either myotubularin-related 2 (MTMR2) or MTMR13 (also called SET-binding factor 2). MTMR2 encodes a member of the myotubularin family of phosphoinositide-3-phosphatases, which dephosphorylate phosphatidylinositol 3-phosphate (PI(3)P) and bisphosphate PI(3,5)P2. MTMR13 encodes a large, uncharacterized member of the myotubularin family. The MTMR13 phosphatase domain is catalytically inactive because the essential Cys and Arg residues are absent. Given the genetic association of both MTMR2 and MTMR13 with CMT4B, we investigated the biochemical relationship between these two proteins. We found that the endogenous MTMR2 and MTMR13 proteins are associated in human embryonic kidney 293 cells. MTMR2-MTMR13 association is mediated by coiled-coil sequences present in each protein. We also examined the cellular localization of MTMR2 and MTMR13 using fluorescence microscopy and subcellular fractionation. We found that (i) MTMR13 is a predominantly membrane-associated protein; (ii) MTMR2 and MTMR13 cofractionate in both a light membrane fraction and a cytosolic fraction; and (iii) MTMR13 membrane association is mediated by the segment of the protein which contains the pseudophosphatase domain. This work, which describes the first cellular or biochemical investigation of the MTMR13 pseudophosphatase protein, suggests that MTMR13 functions in association with MTMR2. Loss of MTMR13 function in CMT4B2 patients may lead to alterations in MTMR2 function and subsequent alterations in 3-phosphoinositide signaling. Such a mechanism would explain the strikingly similar phenotypes of patients with recessive mutations in either MTMR2 or MTMR13.

The level and turnover of phosphoinositides (PIs) are tightly controlled by a large set of PI-specific enzymes (PI kinases and phosphatases). Mammalian PI phosphatases are conserved through evolution and among this large family the dual-specificity phosphatase (PTP/DSP) are metal-independent enzymes displaying the amino acid signature Cys-X5-Arg-Thr/Ser (CX5RT/S) in their active site. Such catalytic site characterizes the myotubularin 3-phosphatases that dephosphorylate PtdIns3P and PtdIns(3,5)P₂ and produce PtdIns5P. Substrates of myotubularins have been implicated in endocytosis and membrane trafficking while PtdIns5P may have a role in signal transduction. As a paradox, 6 of the 14 members of the myotubularin family lack enzymatic activity and are considered as dead phosphatases. Several myotubularins have been genetically linked to human diseases: MTM1 is mutated in the congenital myopathy X-linked centronuclear or myotubular myopathy (XLCNM) and MTMR14 (JUMPY) has been linked to an autosomal form of such disease, while MTMR2 and MTMR13 are mutated in Charcot-Marie-Tooth (CMT) neuropathies. Furthermore, recent evidences from genetic association studies revealed that several other myotubularins could be associated to chronic disorders such as cancer and obesity, highlighting their importance for human health. Here, we discuss cellular and physiological roles of myotubularins and their implication in human diseases, and we present potential pathological mechanisms affecting specific tissues in myotubularin-associated diseases.

Phosphoinositides control many different processes required for normal cellular function. Myotubularins are a family of Phosphatidylinositol 3-phosphate (PtdIns3P) phosphatases identified by the positional cloning of the MTM1 gene in patients suffering from X-linked myotubular myopathy and the MTMR2 gene in patients suffering from the demyelinating neuropathy Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease type 4B. MTM1 is a phosphatidylinositol phosphatase with reported specificity toward PtdIns3P, while the related proteins MTMR2 and MTMR3 hydrolyze both PtdIns3P and PtdIns(3,5)P2. We have investigated MTM1 and MTMR6 and find that they use PtdIns(3,5)P2 in addition to PtdIns3P as a substrate in vitro. The product of PtdIns(3,5)P2 hydrolysis, PtdIns5P, causes MTM1 to form a heptameric ring that is 12.5 nm in diameter, and it is a specific allosteric activator of MTM1, MTMR3, and MTMR6. A disease-causing mutation at arginine 69 of MTM1 falling within a putative pleckstrin homology domain reduces the ability of the enzyme to respond to PtdIns5P. We propose that the myotubularin family of enzymes utilize both PtdIns3P and PtdIns(3,5)P2 as substrates, and that PtdIns5P functions in a positive feedback loop controlling their activity. These findings highlight the importance of regulated phosphatase activity for the control of phosphoinositide metabolism.

MTMR2 is a member of the myotubularin family of inositol lipid phosphatases, a large protein-tyrosine phosphatase subgroup that is conserved from yeast to humans. Furthermore, the peripheral neuromuscular disease Charcot-Marie Tooth disease type 4B has been attributed to mutations in the mtmr2 gene. Because the molecular mechanisms regulating MTMR2 have been poorly defined, we investigated whether reversible phosphorylation might regulate MTMR2 function. We used mass spectrometry-based methods to identify a high stoichiometry phosphorylation site on serine 58 of MTMR2. Phosphorylation at Ser(58), or a phosphomimetic S58E mutation, markedly decreased MTMR2 localization to endocytic vesicular structures. In contrast, a phosphorylation-deficient MTMR2 mutant (S58A) displayed constitutive localization to early endocytic structures. This localization pattern was accompanied by displacement of a PI(3)P-specific sensor protein and an increase in signal transduction pathways. Thus, MTMR2 phosphorylation is likely to be a critical mechanism by which MTMR2 access to its lipid substrate(s) is temporally and spatially regulated, thereby contributing to the control of downstream endosome maturation events.

The myotubularin family of phosphoinositide phosphatases includes several members mutated in neuromuscular diseases or associated with metabolic syndrome, obesity, and cancer. Catalytically dead phosphatases regulate their active homologs by heterodimerization and potentially represent key players in the phosphatase-kinase balance. Although the enzymatic specificity for phosphoinositides indicates a role for myotubularins in endocytosis and membrane trafficking, recent findings in cellular and animal models suggest that myotubularins regulate additional processes including cell proliferation and differentiation, autophagy, cytokinesis, and cytoskeletal and cell junction dynamics. In this review, we discuss how myotubularins regulate such diverse processes, emphasizing newly identified functions in a physiological and pathological context. A better understanding of myotubularin pathophysiology will pave the way towards therapeutic strategies.

The Protein Tyrosine Phosphatase (PTP) family comprises a large and diverse group of enzymes, regulating a range of biological processes through de-phosphorylation of many proteins and lipids. These enzymes share a catalytic mechanism that requires a reduced and reactive cysteine nucleophile, making them potentially sensitive to inactivation and regulation by oxidation. Analysis of ten PTPs identified substantial differences in the sensitivity of these enzymes to oxidation in vitro. More detailed experiments confirmed the following rank order of sensitivity: PTEN and Sac1>PTPL1/FAP-1>>myotubularins. When the apparent sensitivity to oxidation of these PTPs in cells treated with hydrogen peroxide was analysed, this correlated well with the observed sensitivities to oxidation in vitro. These data suggested that different PTPs may fall into at least three different classes with respect to mechanisms of cellular redox regulation. 1. PTEN and Sac1 were readily and reversibly oxidised in vitro and in cells treated with hydrogen peroxide 2. PTPL1 appeared to be resistant to oxidation in cells, correlating with its sensitivity to reduction by glutathione in vitro 3. The myotubularin family of lipid phosphatases was almost completely resistant to oxidation in vitro and in cells. Our results show that sensitivity to reversible oxidation is not a necessary characteristic of the PTPs and imply that such sensitivity has evolved as a regulatory mechanism for some of this large family, but not others.

Myotubularins (MTMs) constitute a large family of lipid phosphatases that specifically dephosphorylate phosphatidylinositol (3)P. MTM1 and MTM2 are mutated in X-linked myotubular myopathy and Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease (type 4B), respectively, although the mechanisms whereby MTM dysfunction leads to these diseases is unknown. To gain insight into MTM function, we undertook the study of MTMs in the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans, which possesses representative homologues of the four major subgroups of MTMs identified in mammals. As in mammals, we found that C. elegans MTMs mediate distinct functions. let-512 (vps34) encodes the C. elegans homologue of the yeast and mammalian homologue of the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase Vps34. We found that reduction of mtm-6 (F53A2.8) function by RNA inhibition rescued the larval lethality of let-512 (vps34) mutants and that the reduction of mtm-1 (Y110A7A.5) activity by RNA inhibition rescued the endocytosis defect of let-512 animals. Together, these observations provide genetic evidence that MTMs negatively regulate phosphatidylinositol (3)P levels. Analysis of MTM expression patterns using transcriptional green fluorescence protein reporters demonstrated that these two MTMs exhibit mostly non-overlapping expression patterns and that MTM-green fluorescence protein fusion proteins are localized to different subcellular locations. These observations suggest that some of the different functions of MTMs might, in part, be a consequence of unique expression and localization patterns. However, our finding that at least three C. elegans MTMs play essential roles in coelomocyte endocytosis, a process that also requires VPS34, indicates that MTMs do not simply turn off VPS34 but unexpectedly also function as positive regulators of biological processes.

Autophagy initiation is strictly dependent on phosphatidylinositol 3-phosphate (PI3P) synthesis. PI3P production is under tight control of PI3Kinase, hVps34, in complex with Beclin-1. Mammalian cells express several PI3P phosphatases that belong to the myotubularin family. Even though some of them have been linked to serious human diseases, their cellular function is largely unknown. Two recent studies indicate that PI3P metabolism involved in autophagy initiation is further regulated by the PI3P phosphatases Jumpy and MTMR3. Additional pools of PI3P, upstream of mTOR and on the endocytic pathway, may modulate autophagy indirectly, suggesting that other PI3P phosphatases might be involved in this process. This review sums up our knowledge on PI3P phosphatases and discusses the recent progress on their role in autophagy.

X-linked myotubular myopathy (XLMTM) is a congenital disorder caused by mutations of the myotubularin gene, MTM1. Myotubularin belongs to a large family of conserved lipid phosphatases that include both catalytically active and inactive myotubularin-related proteins (i.e., "MTMRs"). Biochemically, catalytically inactive MTMRs have been shown to form heteroligomers with active members within the myotubularin family through protein-protein interactions. However, the pathophysiological significance of catalytically inactive MTMRs remains unknown in muscle. By in vitro as well as in vivo studies, we have identified that catalytically inactive myotubularin-related protein 12 (MTMR12) binds to myotubularin in skeletal muscle. Knockdown of the mtmr12 gene in zebrafish resulted in skeletal muscle defects and impaired motor function. Analysis of mtmr12 morphant fish showed pathological changes with central nucleation, disorganized Triads, myofiber hypotrophy and whorled membrane structures similar to those seen in X-linked myotubular myopathy. Biochemical studies showed that deficiency of MTMR12 results in reduced levels of myotubularin protein in zebrafish and mammalian C2C12 cells. Loss of myotubularin also resulted in reduction of MTMR12 protein in C2C12 cells, mice and humans. Moreover, XLMTM mutations within the myotubularin interaction domain disrupted binding to MTMR12 in cell culture. Analysis of human XLMTM patient myotubes showed that mutations that disrupt the interaction between myotubularin and MTMR12 proteins result in reduction of both myotubularin and MTMR12. These studies strongly support the concept that interactions between myotubularin and MTMR12 are required for the stability of their functional protein complex in normal skeletal muscles. This work highlights an important physiological function of catalytically inactive phosphatases in the pathophysiology of myotubular myopathy and suggests a novel therapeutic approach through identification of drugs that could stabilize the myotubularin-MTMR12 complex and hence ameliorate this disorder.

Myotubularin, the phosphatase mutated in X-linked myotubular myopathy, was shown to dephosphorylate phosphatidylinositol 3-monophosphate (PtdIns3P) and was also reported to interact with nuclear transcriptional regulators from the trithorax family. We have characterized a panel of specific antibodies and investigated the subcellular localization of myotubularin. Myotubularin is not detected in the nucleus, and localizes mostly as a dense cytoplasmic network. Overexpression of myotubularin does not detectably affect vesicle trafficking in the mammalian cells investigated, in contrast to previous observations in yeast models. Both mutation of a key aspartate residue of myotubularin and dominant activation of Rac1 GTPase lead to the recruitment of myotubularin to specific plasma membrane domains. Localization to Rac1-induced ruffles is dependent on the presence of a domain highly conserved in the myotubularin family (that we named RID). We thus propose that myotubularin may dephosphorylate a subpool of PtdIns3P (or another related substrate) at the plasma membrane.

Myotubularin-related genes define a novel highly conserved family of eukaryotic proteins of at least 11 human members. The hMTM1 gene that codes for myotubularin is mutated in X-linked myotubular myopathy, a severe congenital disease. Recently, we and others have characterized myotubularin as a potent and specific phosphatidylinositol 3-phosphate 3-phosphatase. In the present study we investigated the lipid phosphatase activity and the subcellular localization of two other members of the family, hMTMR2 protein that is mutated in the demyelinating neuropathy Charcot-Marie-Tooth type 4B and the FYVE-finger containing hMTMR3 protein. Our results show that both proteins are potent phosphatidylinositol 3-phosphate 3-phosphatases either in vitro or in yeast where they interfered with vesicular trafficking. Their localization is mainly cytoplasmic, with however strong labeling of Rac-inducible plasma membrane ruffles. The fact that the ubiquitously expressed hMTM1 and hMTMR2 genes are involved in different pathologies indicates that despite their shared enzymatic activity, they are not functionally redundant, at least in certain cell types. This might be explained by subtle differences in expression and/or in recruitment and regulation at their specific site of action.

The myotubularin-related genes define a large family of eukaryotic proteins, most of them initially characterized by the presence of a ten-amino acid consensus sequence related to the active sites of tyrosine phosphatases, dual-specificity protein phosphatases and the lipid phosphatase PTEN. Myotubularin (hMTM1), the founder member, is mutated in myotubular myopathy, and a close homolog (hMTMR2) was recently found mutated in a recessive form of Charcot-Marie-Tooth neuropathy. Although myotubularin was thought to be a dual-specificity protein phosphatase, recent results indicate that it is primarily a lipid phosphatase, acting on phosphatidylinositol 3-monophosphate, and might be involved in the regulation of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI 3-kinase) pathway and membrane trafficking.

Myotubularin related protein 2 (MTMR2) is a member of the myotubularin family of phosphoinositide lipid phosphatases. Although MTMR2 dephosphorylates the phosphoinositides PI(3)P and PI(3,5)P2, the phosphoinositide binding proteins that are regulated by MTMR2 are poorly characterized. In this study, phosphoinositide affinity chromatography coupled to mass spectrometry identified receptor mediated endocytosis 8 (RME-8) as a novel PI(3)P binding protein. RME-8 co-localized with the PI(3)P marker DsRed-FYVE, while the N-terminal region of RME-8 is required for PI(3)P and PI(3,5)P(2) binding in vitro. Depletion of PI(3)P by MTMR2 S58A or wortmannin treatment attenuated RME-8 endosomal localization and co-localization with EGFR on early endosomes. Our results suggest a model in which the localization of RME-8 to endosomal compartments is spatially mediated by PI(3)P binding and temporally regulated by MTMR2 activity.

Autophagy is a ubiquitous cellular process responsible for the bulk degradation of cytoplasmic components through the autophagosomal-lysosomal pathway. In skeletal muscle, autophagy has been regarded as a key regulator for muscle mass maintenance, and its imbalance leads to sarcopenia. However, the underlying mechanism is poorly understood. In this study, we demonstrate that ceMTM3, a FYVE-domain containing myotubalarin family phosphatase, is required for the maintenance of muscle fibers by preventing excessive autophagy in Caenorhabditis elegans. Knockdown of ceMTM3 by using feeding-based RNA interference caused loss of muscle fibers accompanied by shortening of muscle cell and body size in aged C. elegans worms. This was preceded by the occurrence of excessive autophagy in the muscle and other tissues, which subsequently resulted in increased lysosomal activity and necrotic cell death. However, knockdown of ceMTM3 did not aggravate the abnormalities of muscle wasting in autophagy-deficient atg-18 mutant worms. Our data suggest an important role of ceMTM3 in regulating autophagy and maintaining muscle fibers. This study may have clinical implications for prevention and treatment of sarcopenia.

The myotubularin family is a large eukaryotic group within the tyrosine/dual-specificity phosphatase super-family (PTP/DSP). Among the 14 human members, three are mutated in genetic diseases: myotubular myopathy and two forms of Charcot-Marie-Tooth neuropathy. We present an analysis of the myotubularin family in sequenced genomes. The myotubularin family encompasses catalytically active and inactive phosphatases, and both classes are well conserved from nematode to man. Catalytically active myotubularins dephosphorylate phosphatidylinositol 3-phosphate (PtdIns3P) and PtdIns3,5P2, leading to the production of PtdIns and PtdIns5P. This activity may be modulated by direct interaction with catalytically inactive myotubularins. These phosphoinositides are signaling molecules that are notably involved in vacuolar transport and membrane trafficking. Myotubularins are thus proposed to be implicated in these cellular mechanisms, and recent observations on myotubularins homologues in the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans indicate a role in endocytosis.

Myotubularin-related proteins are a large subfamily of protein tyrosine phosphatases (PTPs) that dephosphorylate D3-phosphorylated inositol lipids. Mutations in members of the myotubularin family cause the human neuromuscular disorders myotubular myopathy and type 4B Charcot-Marie-Tooth syndrome. The crystal structure of a representative member of this family, MTMR2, reveals a phosphatase domain that is structurally unique among PTPs. A series of mutants are described that exhibit altered enzymatic activity and provide insight into the specificity of myotubularin phosphatases toward phosphoinositide substrates. The structure also reveals that the GRAM domain, found in myotubularin family phosphatases and predicted to occur in approximately 180 proteins, is part of a larger motif with a pleckstrin homology (PH) domain fold. Finally, the MTMR2 structure will serve as a model for other members of the myotubularin family and provide a framework for understanding the mechanism whereby mutations in these proteins lead to disease.

Phosphatidylinositol (PtdIns) is a membrane phospholipid composed of diacylglycerol and a D-myo-inositol head group. In mammals, the hydroxyl groups at the D3, D4 and D5 positions of the inositol ring can be phosphorylated to yield seven phosphoinositide derivatives. PtdIns-3,5-bisphosphate [PtdIns(3,5)P2] is the most recently discovered species of phosphoinositide that is generated by the phosphorylation of PtdIns(3)P at the D5 position by PtdIns phosphate kinase and catabolized through the dephosphorylation by myotubularin family of phosphatases. Genetic and biochemical analyses of the enzymes metabolizing PtdIns(3,5)P2 have revealed that this phospholipid is involved in the control of endolysosomal systems and plays crucial roles in various mammalian tissues. In this article, we review the current state of knowledge of the metabolic/physiological functions of PtdIns(3,5)P2, and describe how disruption of these functions may contribute to human diseases.

It has been shown that mutations in at least four myotubularin family genes (MTM1, MTMR1, 2 and 13) are causative for human neuromuscular disorders. However, the pathway and regulative mechanism remain unknown. Here, we reported a new role for Mtmr8 in neuromuscular development of zebrafish. Firstly, we cloned and characterized zebrafish Mtmr8, and revealed the expression pattern predominantly in the eye field and somites during early somitogenesis. Using morpholino knockdown, then, we observed that loss-of-function of Mtmr8 led to defects in somitogenesis. Subsequently, the possible underlying mechanism and signal pathway were examined. We first checked the Akt phosphorylation, and observed an increase of Akt phosphorylation in the morphant embryos. Furthermore, we studied the PH/G domain function within Mtmr8. Although the PH/G domain deletion by itself did not result in embryonic defect, addition of PI3K inhibitor LY294002 did give a defective phenotype in the PH/G deletion morphants, indicating that the PH/G domain was essential for Mtmr8's function. Moreover, we investigated the cooperation of Mtmr8 with PI3K in actin filament modeling and muscle development, and found that both Mtmr8-MO1 and Mtmr8-MO2+LY294002 led to the disorganization of the actin cytoskeleton. In addition, we revealed a possible participation of Mtmr8 in the Hedgehog pathway, and cell transplantation experiments showed that Mtmr8 worked in a non-cell autonomous manner in actin modeling. The above data indicate that a conserved functional cooperation of Mtmr8 with PI3K regulates actin filament modeling and muscle development in zebrafish, and reveal a possible participation of Mtmr8 in the Hedgehog pathway. Therefore, this work provides a new clue to study the physiological function of MTM family members.

The MTM (myotubularin)/MTMR (myotubularin-related) protein family is comprised of 15 lipid phosphatases, of which nine members are catalytically active. MTMs are known to play a fundamental role in human physiology as gene mutations can give rise to X-linked myotubular myopathy or Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease, which manifest in skeletal muscle or in peripheral neurons respectively. Interestingly, studies have shown MTMR2 and MTMR5, two MTM family members, to be highly expressed in the testis, particularly in Sertoli and germ cells, and knockout of either gene resulted in spermatogenic defects. Other studies have shown that MTMR2 functions in endocytosis and membrane trafficking. In the testis, MTMR2 interacts and co-localizes with c-Src/phospho-Src-(Tyr⁴¹⁶), a non-receptor protein tyrosine kinase that regulates the phosphorylation state of proteins at the apical ES (ectoplasmic specialization), a unique type of cell junction found between Sertoli cells and elongating/elongated spermatids. In the present review, we highlight recent findings that have made a significant impact on our understanding of this protein family in normal cell function and in disease, with the emphasis on the role of MTMs and MTMRs in spermatogenesis. We also describe a working model to explain how MTMR2 interacts with other proteins such as c-Src, dynamin 2, EPS8 (growth factor receptor pathway substrate 8) and ARP2/3 (actin-related protein 2/3) at the apical ES and the apical TBC (tubulobulbar complex; tubular-like invaginations that function in the disassembly of the apical ES and in the recycling of its components) to regulate spermiation at late stage VIII of the seminiferous epithelial cycle.

Phosphatidylinositol 3-phosphate [PtdIns(3)P] acts as a second messenger via the recruitment of diverse signalling proteins to various cellular compartments. Recent advances have highlighted the association of human diseases with mutations in phosphatases that regulate PtdIns(3)P levels. Myotubularin, the gene mutated in myotubular myopathy, functions as a lipid phosphatase with specificity for PtdIns(3)P. It is now apparent that there is an increasing family of proteins that are defined by their significant homology with myotubularin. The myotubularin-related gene family includes proteins that exhibit a lipid phosphatase catalytic motif, those that contain mutations of the critical catalytic residues, and at least one protein that functions as an adapter subunit for PtdIns(3)P-3-phosphatase activity. The present challenge is to understand how deregulation of phosphoinositide metabolism causes human disease.

Mutations in the gene encoding myotubularin-related protein 2 (MTMR2) are responsible for autosomal recessive Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease type 4B1 (CMT4B1), a severe hereditary motor and sensory neuropathy characterized by focally folded myelin sheaths and demyelination. MTMR2 belongs to the myotubularin family, which is characterized by the presence of a phosphatase domain. Myotubularin (MTM), the archetype member of this family, is mutated in X-linked myotubular myopathy. Although MTMR2 and MTM are closely related, they are likely to have different functions. Recent studies revealed that MTM dephosphorylates specifically phosphatidylinositol 3-phosphate. Here we analyze the biochemical properties of the mouse Mtmr2 protein, which shares 97% amino acid identity with human MTMR2. We show that phosphatidylinositol-3-phosphate is also a substrate for Mtmr2, but, unlike myotubularin, Mtmr2 dephosphorylates phosphatidylinositol 3,5-bisphosphate with high efficiency and peak activity at neutral pH. We demonstrate that the known disease-associated MTMR2 mutations lead to dramatically reduced phosphatase activity, suggesting that the MTMR2 phosphatase activity is crucial for the proper function of peripheral nerves in CMT4B1. Expression analysis of Mtmr2 suggests particularly high levels in neurons. Thus, the demyelinating neuropathy CMT4B1 might be triggered by the malfunction of neural membrane recycling, membrane trafficking, and/or endocytic or exocytotic processes, combined with altered axon-Schwann cell interactions. Furthermore, the different biochemical properties of MTM and MTMR2 offer a potential explanation for the different human diseases caused by mutations in their respective genes.

In eukaryotic cells, phosphatidylinositol is subject to differential phosphorylation, resulting in the production of seven distinct phosphatidylinositol phosphates, often referred to as phosphoinositides (PIs). PIs have numerous distinct roles in cellular regulation and membrane trafficking. Recently, myotubularin family PI 3-phosphatases have emerged as key regulators of phosphatidylinositol 3-phosphate and phosphatidylinositol 3,5-bisphosphate, two PIs that regulate traffic within the endosomal-lysosomal pathway. Mutations in several myotubularin genes lead to myotubular myopathy and Charcot-Marie-Tooth peripheral neuropathy. Strikingly, nearly half of the members of the human myotubularin family appear to be catalytically inactive. Several inactive myotubularins have essential functions in mammals. Recent work in mammalian cells and model organisms is shedding light on the roles of myotubularins in membrane traffic.

Phosphatidylinositol 3-phosphate [PtdIns(3)P] regulates endocytic trafficking and the sorting of receptors through early endosomes, including the rapid recycling of transferrin (Tfn). However, the phosphoinositide phosphatase that selectively opposes this function is unknown. The myotubularins are a family of eight catalytically active and six inactive enzymes that hydrolyse PtdIns(3)P to form PtdIns. However, the role each myotubularin family member plays in regulating endosomal PtdIns(3)P and thereby endocytic trafficking is not well established. Here, we identify the myotubularin family member MTMR4, which localizes to early endosomes and also to Rab11- and Sec15-positive recycling endosomes. In cells with MTMR4 knockdown, or following expression of the catalytically inactive MTMR4, MTMR4(C407A), the number of PtdIns(3)P-decorated endosomes significantly increased. MTMR4 overexpression delayed the exit of Tfn from early endosomes and its recycling to the plasma membrane. By contrast, expression of MTMR4(C407A), which acts as a dominant-negative construct, significantly accelerated Tfn recycling. However, in MTMR4 knockdown cells Tfn recycling was unchanged, suggesting that other MTMs might also contribute to recycling. MTMR4 regulated the subcellular distribution of Rab11 and, in cells with RNAi-mediated knockdown of MTMR4, Rab11 was directed away from the pericentriolar recycling compartment. The subcellular distribution of VAMP3, a v-SNARE protein that resides in recycling endosomes and endosome-derived transport vesicles, was also regulated by MTMR4. Therefore, MTMR4 localizes at the interface of early and recycling endosomes to regulate trafficking through this pathway.

Autosomal recessive hereditary motor and sensory neuropathy or Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease (CMT) is a severe childhood-onset neuromuscular disorder. Autosomal recessive CMT is genetically heterogeneous with one locus mapped to chromosome 11p15 (CMT4B2). The histopathological hallmarks of CMT4B2 are focal outfoldings of myelin in nerve biopsies. Homozygosity mapping, in a Turkish inbred family with four children affected by CMT characterized by focally folded myelin, provided linkage to the CMT4B2 locus. We identified a large, novel gene, named SET binding factor 2 (SBF2), that lies within this interval and is expressed in various tissues, including spinal cord and peripheral nerve. SBF2 is a member of the pseudo-phosphatase branch of myotubularins and was an obvious candidate for CMT4B2 by virtue of its striking homology to myotubularin-related protein 2 (MTMR2), causing another form of autosomal recessive CMT with outfoldings of the myelin sheaths. Molecular study of the SBF2 gene in the CMT4B family demonstrated the presence of a homozygous inframe deletion of SBF2 exons 11 and 12 in all four affected individuals. On the protein level, this mutation is predicted to disrupt an N-terminal domain that is conserved in SBF2 and its orthologues across species. Myotubularin-related proteins have been suggested to work in phosphoinositide-mediated signalling events that may also convey control of myelination. Localization of SBF2 within the candidate interval, cosegregation with the disease, expression in the peripheral nervous system, and resemblance of the histopathological phenotype to that related to mutations in its paralogue MTMR2 indicate that this gene is the CMT4B2 gene.

Myotubularins, a large family of catalytically active and inactive proteins, belong to a unique subgroup of protein tyrosine phosphatases that use inositol phospholipids, rather than phosphoproteins, as physiological substrates. Here, by integrating crystallographic and deuterium-exchange mass spectrometry studies of human myotubularin-related protein-2 (MTMR2) in complex with phosphoinositides, we define the molecular basis for this unique substrate specificity. Phosphoinositide substrates bind in a pocket located on a positively charged face of the protein, suggesting an electrostatic mechanism for membrane targeting. A flexible, hydrophobic helix makes extensive interactions with the diacylglycerol moieties of substrates, explaining the specificity for membrane-bound phosphoinositides. An extensive H-bonding network and charge-charge interactions within the active site pocket determine phosphoinositide headgroup specificity. The conservation of these specificity determinants within the active, but not the inactive, myotubularins provides insight into the functional differences between the active and inactive members.

Myotubularin is the archetype of a family of highly conserved protein-tyrosine phosphatase-like enzymes. The myotubularin gene, MTM1, is mutated in the genetic disorder, X-linked myotubular myopathy. We and others have previously shown that myotubularin utilizes the lipid second messenger, phosphatidylinositol 3-phosphate (PI(3)P), as a physiologic substrate. We demonstrate here that the myotubularin-related protein MTMR2, which is mutated in the neurodegenerative disorder, type 4B Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease, is also highly specific for PI(3)P as a substrate. Furthermore, the MTM-related phosphatases MTMR1, MTMR3, and MTMR6 also dephosphorylate PI(3)P, suggesting that activity toward this substrate is common to all myotubularin family enzymes. A direct comparison of the lipid phosphatase activities of recombinant myotubularin and MTMR2 demonstrates that their enzymatic properties are indistinguishable, indicating that the lack of functional redundancy between these proteins is likely to be due to factors other than the utilization of different physiologic substrates. To this end, we have analyzed myotubularin and MTMR2 transcripts during induced differentiation of cultured murine C2C12 myoblasts and find that their expression is divergently regulated. In addition, myotubularin and MTMR2 enhanced green fluorescent protein fusion proteins exhibit overlapping but distinct patterns of subcellular localization. Finally, we provide evidence that myotubularin, but not MTMR2, can modulate the levels of endosomal PI(3)P. From these data, we conclude that the developmental expression and subcellular localization of myotubularin and MTMR2 are differentially regulated, resulting in their utilization of specific cellular pools of PI(3)P.

The myotubularins are a large family of inositol polyphosphate 3-phosphatases that, despite having common substrates, subsume unique functions in cells that are disparate. The myotubularin family consists of 16 different proteins, 9 members of which possess catalytic activity, dephosphorylating phosphatidylinositol 3-phosphate [PtdIns(3)P] and phosphatidylinositol 3,5-bisphosphate [PtdIns(3,5)P(2)] at the D-3 position. Seven members are inactive because they lack the conserved cysteine residue in the CX(5)R motif required for activity. We studied a subfamily of homologous myotubularins, including myotubularin-related protein 6 (MTMR6), MTMR7, and MTMR8, all of which dimerize with the catalytically inactive MTMR9. Complex formation between the active myotubularins and MTMR9 increases their catalytic activity and alters their substrate specificity, wherein the MTMR6/R9 complex prefers PtdIns(3,5)P(2) as substrate; the MTMR8/R9 complex prefers PtdIns(3)P. MTMR9 increased the enzymatic activity of MTMR6 toward PtdIns(3,5)P(2) by over 30-fold, and enhanced the activity toward PtdIns(3)P by only 2-fold. In contrast, MTMR9 increased the activity of MTMR8 by 1.4-fold and 4-fold toward PtdIns(3,5)P(2) and PtdIns(3)P, respectively. In cells, the MTMR6/R9 complex significantly increases the cellular levels of PtdIns(5)P, the product of PI(3,5)P(2) dephosphorylation, whereas the MTMR8/R9 complex reduces cellular PtdIns(3)P levels. Consequentially, the MTMR6/R9 complex serves to inhibit stress-induced apoptosis and the MTMR8/R9 complex inhibits autophagy.

The human neuromuscular diseases X-linked myotubular myopathy and Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease type 4B are caused by mutations in myotubularin family proteins. The myotubularins are a unique subfamily of protein tyrosine phosphatases that utilize inositol phospholipids, rather than phosphoproteins, as substrates. Recent structural studies, including the first crystal structure of a myotubularin family protein, have defined the structural features that are characteristic of the family and revealed the molecular basis of their unique substrate specificity. Interestingly, the myotubularin family contains a subgroup of proteins that are catalytically inactive. Recent biochemical studies have established that the inactive myotubularins function as adaptors for the active members and play an important regulatory role within the family.

The myotubularins (MTMs) constitute a large family of phosphoinositide lipid 3-phosphatases with specificity for PtdIns3P and PtdIns (3,5)P2. Mutations in MTM proteins are associated with inherited conditions such as myotubular myopathy and Charcot-Marie-Tooth syndrome. The substrate lipids are known to be regulators of the endosomal pathway through recruitment of specific effector proteins. Hydrolysis of PtdIns (3,5)P2 provides a biosynthetic pathway to the production of PtdIns5P, which itself can allosterically activate MTMs. We review the properties of this intriguing family of proteins and discuss potential physiological functions that include regulation of the endocytic pathway.

Phosphoinositides (PIs) play an essential role in diverse cellular functions. Their intracellular level is strictly regulated by specific PI kinases, phosphatases and phospholipases. Recent discoveries indicate that dysfunctions in the control of their level often lead to pathologies. This review will focus on some human diseases whose etiologies involve PI-metabolizing enzymes. The role of PTEN (phosphatase and tensin homolog deleted on chromosome ten) in cancer, the impact of the Src homology 2-containing inositol-5-phosphatase phosphatases in acute myeloid leukemia or diabetes, the involvement of myotubularin family members in genetic diseases and the implication of OCRL1 in Lowe syndrome will be emphasized. We will also review how some bacterial pathogens have evolved strategies to specifically manipulate the host cell PI metabolism to efficiently infect them.

Myotubularins (MTM) are a large subfamily of lipid phosphatases that specifically dephosphorylate at the D3 position of phosphatidylinositol 3-phosphate (PI(3)P) in PI(3)P and PI(3,5)P2. We recently found that MTMR6 specifically inhibits the Ca2+-activated K+ channel, KCa3.1, by dephosphorylating PI(3)P. We now show that inhibition is specific for MTMR6 and other MTMs do not inhibit KCa3.1. By replacing either or both of the coiled-coil (CC) and pleckstrin homology/GRAM (PH/G) domains of MTMs that failed to inhibit KCa3.1 with the CC and PH/G domains of MTMR6, we found that chimeric MTMs containing both the MTMR6 CC and PH/G domains functioned like MTMR6 to inhibit KCa3.1 channel activity, whereas chimeric MTMs containing either domain alone did not. Immunofluorescent microscopy demonstrated that both the MTMR6 CC and PH/G domains are required to co-localize MTMR6 to the plasma membrane with KCa3.1. These findings support a model in which two specific low affinity interactions are required to co-localize MTMR6 with KCa3.1: 1) between the CC domains on MTMR6 and KCa3.1 and (2) between the PH/G domain and a component of the plasma membrane. Our inability to detect significant interaction of the MTMR6 G/PH domain with phosphoinositides suggests that this domain may bind a protein. Identifying the specific binding partners of the CC and PH/G domains on other MTMs will provide important clues to the specific functions regulated by other MTMs as well as the mechanism(s) whereby loss of some MTMs lead to disease.

The myotubularins are a large family of lipid phosphatases with specificity towards PtdIns3P and PtdIns(3,5)P(2). Each of the 14 family members bears a signature phosphatase domain, which is inactive in six cases due to amino acid changes at the catalytic site. Fragmentary data have indicated heteromeric interactions between myotubularins, which have hitherto paired an active family member with an inactive one. In this study we have conducted a largescale analysis of potential associations within the human myotubularin family, through directed two-hybrid screening and immunoprecipitation of epitope-tagged proteins. We have confirmed all previously reported combinations and identified novel heteromeric interactions: MTMR8 with MTMR9, and MTMR3 with MTMR4, the first such combination of enzymatically active MTMs. We also report the capacity of several family members to self-associate, including MTMR3 and MTMR4. Subcellular localisation studies reveal a unique distribution of MTMR4 to endosomal structures, the major site of substrate lipid accumulation. All active MTMs we have tested (MTM1, MTMR2-MTMR4) reduce endosomal PtdIns3P levels upon overexpression. Despite this, only MTMR4 exerts any effect on EGF receptor trafficking and degradation, which is more pronounced with a phosphatase inactive form of MTMR4 and requires an intact FYVE domain.
