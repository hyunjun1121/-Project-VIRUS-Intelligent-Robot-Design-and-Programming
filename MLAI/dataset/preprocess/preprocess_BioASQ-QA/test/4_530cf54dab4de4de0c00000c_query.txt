What is the main application of SWATH-MS in proteomics?

[PMID: 23227840]
The prevalence of metabolic disorders (MDs), especially diabetes, is rapidly increasing worldwide, leading to an increasing risk of cardiovascular and other socially relevant complications. To boost MD biomarker discovery, advanced proteomics can harmonize metabolomics. Indeed, the rapid development of mass spectrometry (MS) has designated proteomics as an emerging platform to interrogate the plasma/serum proteome for the discovery of next-generation biomarkers exploitable for risk assessment, early detection and prognosis of MDs. Preanalytical plasma/serum treatment, such as combinatorial peptide ligand libraries with nano-liquid chromatography coupled with tandem MS or selected reaction monitoring coupled to triple-quadrupole time-of-flight instruments, are proven clinical laboratory techniques for quantitative analyses. New strategies, such as SWATHâ„¢ MS, which allows us to systematically characterize and quantify query sample sets of 'any protein of interest' in complex biological samples, may dramatically improve next-generation MD biomarkers, especially considering the plethora of candidates coming from the 'bioreactor' gut microbiota affecting MD onset and progression.

SWATH-MS is a data-independent acquisition method that generates, in a single measurement, a complete recording of the fragment ion spectra of all the analytes in a biological sample for which the precursor ions are within a predetermined m/z versus retention time window. To assess the performance and suitability of SWATH-MS-based protein quantification for clinical use, we compared SWATH-MS and SRM-MS-based quantification of N-linked glycoproteins in human plasma, a commonly used sample for biomarker discovery. Using dilution series of isotopically labeled heavy peptides representing biomarker candidates, the LOQ of SWATH-MS was determined to reach 0.0456 fmol at peptide level by targeted data analysis, which corresponds to a concentration of 5-10 ng protein/mL in plasma, while SRM reached a peptide LOQ of 0.0152 fmol. Moreover, the quantification of endogenous glycoproteins using SWATH-MS showed a high degree of reproducibility, with the mean CV of 14.90%, correlating well with SRM results (R(2) = 0.9784). Overall, SWATH-MS measurements showed a slightly lower sensitivity and a comparable reproducibility to state-of-the-art SRM measurements for targeted quantification of the N-glycosites in human blood. However, a significantly larger number of peptides can be quantified per analysis. We suggest that SWATH-MS analysis combined with N-glycoproteome enrichment in plasma samples is a promising integrative proteomic approach for biomarker discovery and verification.

Most proteomic studies use liquid chromatography coupled to tandem mass spectrometry to identify and quantify the peptides generated by the proteolysis of a biological sample. However, with the current methods it remains challenging to rapidly, consistently, reproducibly, accurately, and sensitively detect and quantify large fractions of proteomes across multiple samples. Here we present a new strategy that systematically queries sample sets for the presence and quantity of essentially any protein of interest. It consists of using the information available in fragment ion spectral libraries to mine the complete fragment ion maps generated using a data-independent acquisition method. For this study, the data were acquired on a fast, high resolution quadrupole-quadrupole time-of-flight (TOF) instrument by repeatedly cycling through 32 consecutive 25-Da precursor isolation windows (swaths). This SWATH MS acquisition setup generates, in a single sample injection, time-resolved fragment ion spectra for all the analytes detectable within the 400-1200 m/z precursor range and the user-defined retention time window. We show that suitable combinations of fragment ions extracted from these data sets are sufficiently specific to confidently identify query peptides over a dynamic range of 4 orders of magnitude, even if the precursors of the queried peptides are not detectable in the survey scans. We also show that queried peptides are quantified with a consistency and accuracy comparable with that of selected reaction monitoring, the gold standard proteomic quantification method. Moreover, targeted data extraction enables ad libitum quantification refinement and dynamic extension of protein probing by iterative re-mining of the once-and-forever acquired data sets. This combination of unbiased, broad range precursor ion fragmentation and targeted data extraction alleviates most constraints of present proteomic methods and should be equally applicable to the comprehensive analysis of other classes of analytes, beyond proteomics.

Candida albicans public proteomic datasets, though growing steadily in the last few years, still have a very limited presence in online repositories. We report here the creation of a C. albicans PeptideAtlas comprising near 22,000 distinct peptides at a 0.24% False Discovery Rate (FDR) that account for over 2500 canonical proteins at a 1.2% FDR. Based on data from 16 experiments, we attained coverage of 41% of the C. albicans open reading frame sequences (ORFs) in the database used for the searches. This PeptideAtlas provides several useful features, including comprehensive protein and peptide-centered search capabilities and visualization tools that establish a solid basis for the study of basic biological mechanisms key to virulence and pathogenesis such as dimorphism, adherence, and apoptosis. Further, it is a valuable resource for the selection of candidate proteotypic peptides for targeted proteomic experiments via Selected Reaction Monitoring (SRM) or SWATH-MS. This C. albicans PeptideAtlas resolves the previous absence of fungal pathogens in the PeptideAtlas project. It represents the most extensive characterization of the proteome of this fungus that exists up to the current date, including evidence for uncharacterized ORFs. Through its web interface, PeptideAtlas supports the study of interesting proteins related to basic biological mechanisms key to virulence such as apoptosis, dimorphism and adherence. It also provides a valuable resource to select candidate proteotypic peptides for future (SRM) targeted proteomic experiments.
