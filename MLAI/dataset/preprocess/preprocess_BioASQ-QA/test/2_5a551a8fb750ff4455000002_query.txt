Prolonged treatment with human parathyroid hormone (hPTH) in rats results in development of bone tumors, though this finding has not been supported by clinical experience. The PTH type 1 receptor agonist abaloparatide, selected for its bone anabolic activity, is under clinical development to treat postmenopausal women with osteoporosis. To determine the carcinogenic potential of abaloparatide, Fischer (F344) rats were administered SC daily abaloparatide at doses of 0, 10, 25, and 50 μg/kg or 30 μg/kg hPTH(1-34) as a positive control for up to 2 years. Robust increases in bone density were achieved at all abaloparatide doses and with hPTH(1-34). Comprehensive histopathological analysis reflected a comparable continuum of proliferative changes in bone, mostly osteosarcoma, in both abaloparatide and hPTH(1-34) treated rats. Comparing the effects of abaloparatide and hPTH(1-34) at the 25 and 30 μg/kg respective doses, representing similar exposure multiples to the human therapeutic doses, revealed similar osteosarcoma-associated mortality, tumor incidence, age at first occurrence, and metastatic potential. There were no increases in the incidence of non-bone tumors with abaloparatide compared to vehicle. Thus, near life-long treatment with abaloparatide in rats resulted in dose and time dependent formation of osteosarcomas, with a comparable response to hPTH(1-34) at similar exposure.

Abaloparatide (Tymlos™) is a synthetic peptide analogue of human parathyroid hormone-related protein that was developed by Radius Health as an osteoanabolic agent for the treatment of postmenopausal osteoporosis. Abaloparatide acts through selective activation of the parathyroid hormone type 1 receptor signalling pathway. In April 2017, subcutaneous abaloparatide received its first global approval, in the USA, for the treatment of postmenopausal women with osteoporosis at high risk for fracture, defined as a history of osteoporotic fracture, multiple risk factors for fracture, or patients who have failed or are intolerant to other available osteoporosis therapy. A Marketing Authorization Application for subcutaneous abaloparatide for the treatment of postmenopausal women with osteoporosis was accepted by the European Medicines Agency and is currently under review. Radius is also developing a transdermal formulation of abaloparatide, with administration via a microneedle patch. This article summarizes the milestones in the development of abaloparatide leading to this first approval for the treatment of women with postmenopausal osteoporosis.
