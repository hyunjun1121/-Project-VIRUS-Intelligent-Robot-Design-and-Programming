What is the sedimentation coefficient of the mammalian mitoribosome?

[PMID: 11402041]
The mammalian mitochondrial ribosome (mitoribosome) has a highly protein-rich composition with a small sedimentation coefficient of 55 S, consisting of 39 S large and 28 S small subunits. In the previous study, we analyzed 39 S large subunit proteins from bovine mitoribosome (Suzuki, T., Terasaki, M., Takemoto-Hori, C., Hanada, T., Ueda, T., Wada, A., and Watanabe, K. (2001) J. Biol. Chem. 276, 21724-21736). The results suggested structural compensation for the rRNA deficit through proteins of increased molecular mass in the mitoribosome. We report here the identification of 28 S small subunit proteins. Each protein was separated by radical-free high-reducing two-dimensional polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and analyzed by liquid chromatography/mass spectrometry/mass spectrometry using electrospray ionization/ion trap mass spectrometer to identify cDNA sequence by expressed sequence tag data base searches in silico. Twenty one proteins from the small subunit were identified, including 11 new proteins along with their complete cDNA sequences from human and mouse. In addition to these proteins, three new proteins were also identified in the 55 S mitoribosome. We have clearly identified a mitochondrial homologue of S12, which is a key regulatory protein of translation fidelity and a candidate for the autosomal dominant deafness gene, DFNA4. The apoptosis-related protein DAP3 was found to be a component of the small subunit, indicating a new function for the mitoribosome in programmed cell death. In summary, we have mapped a total of 55 proteins from the 55 S mitoribosome on the two-dimensional polyacrylamide gels.

In the present study, mitochondrial ribosomes of the nematode Ascaris suum were isolated and their physiochemical properties were compared to ribosomes of Escherichia coli. The sedimentation coefficient and buoyant density of A. suum mitochondrial ribosomes were determined. The sedimentation coefficient of the intact monosome was about 55 S. The buoyant density of formaldehyde-fixed ribosomes in cesium chloride was 1.40 g/cm(3), which suggests that the nematode mitoribosomes have a much higher protein composition than other mitoribosomes. The diffusion coefficients obtained from dynamic light scattering measurements were (1.48 +/- 0.04) x 10(-)(7) cm(2) s(-)(1) for 55 S mitoribosomes and (1.74 +/- 0.04) x 10(-)(7) cm(2) s(-)(1) for the 70 S E. coli monosome. The diameter of mitoribosomes was measured by dynamic light-scattering analysis and electron microscopy. Though the nematode mitoribosome has a larger size than the bacterial ribosome, it does not differ significantly in size from mammalian mitoribosomes.

Mitochondrial ribosomes comprise the most diverse group of ribosomes known. The mammalian mitochondrial ribosomes (55S) differ unexpectedly from bacterial (70S) and cytoplasmic ribosomes (80S), as well as other kinds of mitochondrial ribosomes. The bovine mitochondrial ribosome has been developed as a model system for the study of human mitochondrial ribosomes to address several questions related to the structure, function, biosynthesis and evolution of these interesting ribosomes. Bovine mitochondrial ribosomal proteins (MRPs) from each subunit have been identified and characterized with respect to individuality and electrophoretic properties, amino acid sequence, topographic disposition, RNA binding properties, evolutionary relationships and reaction with affinity probes of ribosomal functional domains. Several distinctive properties of these ribosomes are being elucidated, including their antibiotic susceptibility and composition. Mammalian mitochondrial ribosomes lack several of the major RNA stem structures of bacterial ribosomes but they contain a correspondingly higher protein content (as many as 80 proteins), suggesting a model where proteins have replaced RNA structural elements during the evolution of these ribosomes. Despite their lower RNA content they are physically larger than bacterial ribosomes, because of the 'extra' proteins they contain. The extra proteins in mitochondrial ribosomes are 'new' in the sense that they are not homologous to proteins in bacterial or cytoplasmic ribosomes. Some of the new proteins appear to be bifunctional. All of the mammalian MRPs are encoded in nuclear genes (a separate set from those encoding cytoplasmic ribosomal proteins) which are evolving more rapidly than those encoding cytoplasmic ribosomal proteins. The MRPs are imported into mitochondria where they assemble coordinately with mitochondrially transcribed rRNAs into ribosomes that are responsible for translating the 13 mRNAs for essential proteins of the oxidative phosphorylation system. Interest is growing in the structure, organization, chromosomal location and expression of genes for human MRPs. Proteins which are essential for mitoribosome function are candidates for involvement in human genetic disease.

The mammalian mitochondrial (mt) ribosome (mitoribosome) is a bacterial-type ribosome but has a highly protein-rich composition. Almost half of the rRNA contained in the bacterial ribosome is replaced with proteins in the mitoribosome. Escherichia coli elongation factor G (EF-G Ec) has no translocase activity on the mitoribosome but EF-G mt is functional on the E.coli ribosome. To investigate the functional equivalency of the mt and E.coli ribosomes, we prepared hybrid mt and E.coli ribosomes. The hybrid mitoribosome containing E.coli L7/12 (L7/12 Ec) instead of L7/12 mt clearly activated the GTPase of EF-G Ec and efficiently promoted its translocase activity in an in vitro translation system. Thus, the mitoribosome is functionally equivalent to the E.coli ribosome despite their distinct compositions. The mt EF-Tu-dependent translation activity of the E.coli ribosome was also clearly enhanced by replacing the C-terminal domain (CTD) of L7/12 Ec with the mt counterpart (the hybrid E.coli ribosome). This strongly indicates that the CTD of L7/12 is responsible for EF-Tu function. These results demonstrate that functional compatibility between elongation factors and the L7/12 protein in the ribosome governs its translational specificity.

The 55 S mammalian mitochondrial ribosome (referred to hereafter as "mitoribosome") is protein-rich, containing nearly twice as much protein as the Escherichia coli ribosome. In order to produce soluble mitochondrial proteins and protein-deficient subribosomal particles for use in functional and structural studies, the proteins of bovine mitoribosomes were extracted by washing in a series of buffers containing increasing concentrations of LiCl as the only chaotropic agent. LiCl disruption is used in order to preserve the solubilized proteins in a substantially "native" configuration. The extraction mixtures were characterized by sucrose density gradient analysis and the compositions of the stripped protein and residual pellet fractions were determined by two-dimensional polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. In order to analyze the behavior or individual proteins, the intensity of Coomassie blue stain for each protein was normalized against the intensity of stain for the same protein in a control sample. Buffers with 1, 2, and 4 M LiCl each extract a specific subset of mitoribosomal proteins, while another group of proteins remains in the residual pellet fraction. Although very few proteins are detected in only one condition, most proteins are specifically enriched in one fraction. This LiCl procedure, therefore, produces fractionated groups of mitoribosomal proteins which can be used directly as a source for those proteins in which they are enriched, or they can be used as a starting point in further purification procedures. In contrast to results with E. coli ribosomes, several mitoribosomal proteins remain core-associated, indicating a different structural organization in these ribosomes.

Mitochondria can be isolated from skeletal muscle in a manner that preserves tightly coupled bioenergetic function in vitro. The purpose of this study was to characterize the composition of such preparations using a proteomics approach. Mitochondria isolated from human vastus lateralis biopsies were functional as evidenced by their response to carbohydrate and fat-derived fuels. Using one-dimensional gel electrophoresis and HPLC-ESI-MS/MS, 823 unique proteins were detected, and 487 of these were assigned to the mitochondrion, including the newly characterized SIRT5, MitoNEET and RDH13. Proteins detected included 9 of the 13 mitochondrial DNA-encoded proteins and 86 of 104 electron transport chain (ETC) and ETC-related proteins. In addition, 59 of 78 proteins of the 55S mitoribosome, several TIM and TOM proteins and cell death proteins were present. This study presents an efficient method for future qualitative assessments of proteins from functional isolated mitochondria from small samples of healthy and diseased skeletal muscle.
