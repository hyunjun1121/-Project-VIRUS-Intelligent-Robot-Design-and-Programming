IDEAL_ANSWER:
- We developed the ExpressDB database for yeast RNA expression data and loaded it with approximately 17.5 million pieces of data reported by 11 studies with three different kinds of high-throughput RNA assays.
- The MOPED database (http://arep.med.har. Edu/ expressDB) provides access to extensive gene expression data from yeast genomes.
- We developed the ExpressDB database for yeast RNA expression data and loaded it with approximately 17.5 million pieces of data reported by 11 studies with three different kinds of high-throughput RNA assays. MOPED (Multi-Omics Profiling Expression Database; http://moped.proteinspire.org) has transitioned from solely a protein expression database to a multi-omics resource for human and model organisms.
- The ExpressDB database is a database for yeast RNA expression data. The FED database is for fungal gene expression data for yeast.
