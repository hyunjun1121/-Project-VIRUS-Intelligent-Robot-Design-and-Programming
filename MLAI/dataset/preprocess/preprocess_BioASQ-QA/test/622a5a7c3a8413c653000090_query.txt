To establish gender-specific differences in maternal and fetal immune response in healthy human fetuses at term. Forty-five women with elective caesarean sections for uncomplicated singleton pregnancies were recruited for two studies. Using a multiplex biomarker immunoassay system, unstimulated maternal and fetal plasma concentrations of interleukin (IL)-1β, IL-1ra, IL-6, IL-8, macrophage inflammatory protein (MIP)-1α, and tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-α were measured from one study population. Lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-stimulated cytokine response was measured in a second study. There were no significant gender differences in either maternal or fetal unstimulated plasma cytokine concentrations, but concentrations of the proinflammatory cytokines IL-1β and IL-6 were significantly greater in male fetal LPS-stimulated samples than in female fetal samples. Blood of male fetuses mounts a larger pro-inflammatory response to lipopolysaccharide (LPS). This heightened response could be a critical pathway in promoting premature rupture of membranes (PPROM) and may be associated with life long differential gender response to infection.

To assess prevalence and risk factors for posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and depression in fathers after early preeclampsia (PE) or preterm premature rupture of membranes (PPROM). Partners of patients hospitalized for PE or PPROM and partners of healthy controls completed PTSD (PSS-SR) and depression (BDI-II) questionnaires during pregnancy (t 1) and 6 weeks postpartum (t 2). 85 of the 187 eligible men participated (51 partners of patients, 34 partners of control) at t 1, and 66 men participated both time points. No significant differences were found between partners of patients and partners of controls in symptoms of PTSD and depression (t 1: p = 0.28 for PTSD and p = 0.34 for depression; t 2: p = 0.08 for PTSD and p = 0.31 for depression). For partners of patients, correlation between PTSD and depression sum-scores was 0.48 (p < 0.001) at t 1 and 0.86 (p < 0.001) at t 2. Within-couple correlation was low and not significant during pregnancy, but strong at postpartum (PSS-SR: r = 0.62, p < 0.001; BDI-II: r = 0.59, p < 0.001). Higher paternal age was associated with more symptoms of PTSD and depression postpartum in partners of patients. Symptoms of PTSD and depression during pregnancy predicted the occurrence of PTSD symptoms following childbirth in partners of patients. Symptoms of PTSD and depression occurred at a similar rate in partners of women with PE or PPROM and partners of healthy pregnant controls. Symptoms of PTSD and depression during pregnancy predicted the occurrence of PTSD symptoms following childbirth. Increased paternal age predicted more symptoms of PTSD and depression postpartum. At 6 weeks postpartum, a strong association was found between men and women in symptoms of PTSD and depression.

Gender differences in several adverse pregnancy outcomes have been described, including preterm labour and delivery. In the low risk population, the male fetus is at significantly higher risk of spontaneous preterm birth. Our objective was to examine the risk effect of fetal gender on pregnant women at higher risk of preterm birth, and therefore its potential impact on targeting management. This was an analysis of prospectively collected data from a dedicated inner-city Prematurity Surveillance Clinic over a sixteen-year period. All women were high-risk for preterm delivery in view of their history, which included previous late miscarriage, PTB or significant cervical surgery. Obstetric variables and pregnancy outcomes were compared in male and female babies. Demographic and risk factors were compared between groups, and both spontaneous and iatrogenic preterm delivery rates interrogated (<24, <28, <34 and <37 weeks' gestation). Risk ratios (with 95% confidence intervals) were calculated for each gestational band. In this cohort, 14.5% of women (363/2505) delivered before 37 weeks. Pregnant women were stratified by fetal gender and were comparable for referral risk factors and demographic characteristics. There was no significant association between fetal gender and incidence of miscarriage less than 24 weeks (RR 1.17, 95% CI 0.65-2.10, p = 0.607), or preterm births 24 to 37 weeks RR 1.07 (95% CI 0.82-1.40, p = 0.383). Furthermore, analysis by gestational band [<28 RR 0.91 (95% CI 0.60-1.37, p = 0.647), <34 RR 1.18 (95% CI 0.89-1.57, p = 0.257 and <37 weeks RR 1.10 (95% CI 0.91-1.33, p = 0.309)] also showed no effect. This held true for both spontaneous and iatrogenic preterm delivery. In our high-risk cohort there was no gender difference for preeclampsia (RR 0.93, 95% CI 0.61 to 1.41, p = 0.725) or preterm premature rupture of membranes (PPROM) (RR 1.14, 95% CI 0.86 to 1.50, p = 0.384) CONCLUSIONS: In a high-risk cohort there was no significant increased risk of miscarriage, spontaneous or iatrogenic PTB, preeclampsia or PPROM for the male fetus. This is contradictory to low-risk populations and confirms that gender need not be integrated into high-risk management protocols for preterm birth.

Preterm premature rupture of membranes (PPROM) is defined as a rupture of the amniotic membranes occurring before 37 weeks of gestation and before the onset of labor. Extreme PPROM occurs prior to 26 weeks gestation and contributes to an increased risk of prematurity, leading to maternal and fetal complications. This study aims to estimate the risk factors associated with various maternal complications and to determine the worst outcomes in Omani females with extreme PPROM. A retrospective cohort study was conducted on 44 women with extreme PPROM, who delivered at Sultan Qaboos University Hospital (SQUH) from January 2006 to December 2011. Women with incomplete information, multiple gestations, or a preterm delivery resulting from medical intervention, as well as women who delivered elsewhere were excluded from the study. Forty-four women with extreme PPROM were included in our study. The results revealed the most important risk factor to be history of infection, which was noted in 24 study participants. The mean maternal age was 30 years. The mean gestational age at PPROM and at delivery were 20.7±3.2 (range: 16-26 weeks) and 29.7±7.6 weeks (range: 17-40 weeks), respectively. The maternal complications observed in this study included; infection which was seen in 20 (45%) patients, antepartum hemorrhage in 11 (25%) patients, and cesarean section which was required in 12 (27%) patients. There was no significant association between risk factors such as gestational age at delivery, parity, maternal age at PPROM, or maternal Body Mass Index (BMI) and cesarean section rate. Infection played a major role, both as a risk factor and in causing extreme PPROM, which in turn increased in 12 patients (27%). In the multivariable model for predicting the need for cesarean section (gestational age at delivery, parity, maternal age at PPROM in years and maternal BMI), none of the factors were statistically significant. Overall, concurrent infection rate was high among patients presenting with extreme PPROM. None of the baseline maternal factors predicted the need for cesarean section. This is likely due to the small sample size; hence, larger prospective studies are needed to confirm these findings.

Objective: To show that infants delivered prematurely because of preterm premature rupture of the membranes (PPROM) show a tendency for asymmetric intrauterine growth retardation (IUGR). At the same time, to demonstrate that these pregnancies exhibit nutritional deprivation by the presence of correspondingly smaller placentas, as demonstrated by the placental-fetal ratio.Study Design: A prospective study was performed over 2 years comparing the tendency for IUGR in infants born of pregnancies with PPROM (N = 86), as compared to normal term controls (N = 351). The tendency for growth restriction in the neonate was determined using the ponderal index at birth. Exclusion criteria included pregnancies complicated by diabetes, hypertension, preeclampsia, multiple gestations, genetic, and other recognized causes of IUGR. Four controls were selected for each study patient who delivered the same day. The mean ponderal index (PI(m)) was compared, as were the mean placental-fetal weight ratios (PWt/PI)(m), for both groups. A comparison of the PI(m) and (PWt/PI)(m) for infants delivered prematurely with and without rupture of membranes was also noted. Analysis was by the paired Student's t test and chi(2) test.Results: The newborn PI was found to be independent of maternal age, gravidy, and parity. The number of male and female infants were not significantly different in the control and study groups. The PI(m) for the PPROM group (PI(m) = 2.33, SD = 0.29) was significantly smaller than that for the controls (PI(m) = 2.52, SD = 0.23) (P <.0005). Similarly the (PWt/PI)(m) for the PPROM group (mean = 194.8, SD = 49.9) was significantly smaller than that for the control group (mean = 273.4, SD = 54.2) (P <.0005). Mean values of PI and PWt/PI for preterm deliveries with, as compared to without rupture of membranes, showed no significant differences.Conclusions: Using the ponderal index to detect IUGR, a significant association of IUGR is noted in infants delivered subsequent to PPROM. This growth impairment is accompanied by significantly smaller placentas.

<b>Background:</b> Placental dysfunction, inflammation and degradation of fetal membranes has been hypothesized as a cause of preterm prelabor of rupture of membranes.<b>Objective:</b> To examine the effect of aspirin, an anti-inflammatory agent, on the prevalence of preterm prelabor rupture of membranes (PPRoMs).<b>Methods:</b> A retrospective analysis was conducted to examine the effect of aspirin on the prevalence of PPRoM. Aspirin (150 mg, nocte) was prescribed to women who were identified through a screening program at 11-13<sup>+6</sup> weeks' gestation as being at high risk for developing early-onset preeclampsia. Women who were at low risk for developing preeclampsia did not receive aspirin. The prevalence of PPRoM was compared with an observational cohort.<b>Results:</b> In the observational cohort, there were 3027 women, including 32 (1.1%) cases of PPRoM. The prevalence of PPRoM in the high risk group was 3.1% (4/128) and was statistically significantly higher compared to the low risk group (1.0%) (28/2899). The relative risk was 3.02 (95% CI 1.2-7.7; <i>p</i>= .04). In the interventional cohort, there were 7280 women, with 114 (1.6%) cases of PPRoM. The prevalence of PPRoM in the high risk group who were treated with aspirin was 1.8% (14/766) compared to 1.5% (100/6516) in the low risk group (<i>p</i>= .54). The prevalence of PPRoM in high risk patients in the observational group (who did not receive aspirin) compared with the high risk patients in the interventional group (who were treated with aspirin) was not statistically significant (<i>p</i>= .31).<b>Conclusions:</b> PPRoM is significantly associated with a description of high risk for ePET; although, this algorithm is not a good screening tool for predicting PPRoM. Aspirin treatment of women deemed high risk for ePET is safe in the context of PPRoM and there may be some reduction in prevalence of PPRoM in treated high risk women; although, this study was not powered to demonstrate a small reduction in the prevalence of PPRoM. The findings merit further investigation through a larger prospective study with adequate sample size.

Preterm premature rupture of membranes (PPROM) is defined as rupture of membrane that happens before the onset of labor and 37 weeks. Subclinical intrauterine infection is major etiological factor in the pathogenesis that increases mortality and morbidity associated with PPROM. This study was performed to evaluate the levels of maternal serum urokinase plasminogen activator receptor (uPAR), ST2 and interleukin (IL)-33 in PPROM and its relation with maternofetal infectious and morbidity. A total of 74 pregnant women, of which 49 with PPROM between 24 and 34 weeks gestation, and 25 normal pregnant women without PPROM were included in the study. Study group was seperated into 2 subgroups as PPROM and PPROM-histological chorioamnionitis (PPROM-HC). The blood samples were taken before the any medication. The mean serum IL-33, ST2, and uPAR values in the PPROM-HC group were significantly higher than PPROM and control group. The cut-off values of IL-33, ST2, and uPAR were determined as 5.2, 2 and 6.4 ng/mL, respectively. A cut-off value of IL-33 of 5.2 ng/mL, the cut-off of ST2 of 2 ng/mL and the cut-off of uPAR of 6.4 ng/mL showed similar sensitivity, specificity to IL-6 and the better sensitivity and specificity as compared to C-reactive protein and total leucocyte count in predicting infection in PPROM. We evaluated the predictive value of uPAR, ST2 and IL-33 in PPROM and we concluded that all of them can be used as reliable biomarkers to determine infection without any clinical signs but it is necessary to be studied in different cohort groups and infectious diseases.

To evaluate the epidemiology of pulmonary candidiasis (PC) and to identify risk factors in premature infants during the 1st month of life, all infants with a birth weight <1250 g admitted to our neonatal intensive care unit with PC between January 1994 and December 2001 were retrospectively reviewed. Infants with PC ( n =20) were compared with a control group ( n =20), matched for gestational age and birth weight, with regard to possible perinatal and postnatal risk factors. Among 325 infants with a birth weight <1250 g, 20 out of 233 ventilated infants (8.6%) developed PC. Candida albicans ( n =12) and C. parapsilosis ( n =4) were the predominant isolates. Neonates with PC were significantly different from controls with regard to male prevalence ( P =0.002), rates of preterm premature rupture of membranes (PPROM) ( P =0.02), longer duration of antibiotic therapy ( P =0.01) and of ventilation ( P =0.02). The difference between groups did not attain significance with regard to postnatal dexamethasone administration, duration of central vein catheterisation and duration of parenteral nutrition. Multivariate logistic regression analysis indicated as significant predictors of PC, among perinatal data, the male gender (OR =26.3; 95%CI 2.44 to 284) and PPROM (OR =12.3; 95%CI 1.16 to 130) and, among postnatal data, the duration of ventilation (OR =1.54; 95%CI 1.01 to 2.34). The presence of preterm premature rupture of membranes and the duration of ventilation are significant risk factors for developing pulmonary candidiasis and should be considered in the preventive efforts to reduce this disease in infants with a birth weight <1250 g.

A 32-year-old Caucasian woman of body mass index (BMI) 46 presented with urinary symptoms to accident and emergency (A&E). Acute pyelonephritis was the diagnosis. Transabdominal scan revealed a live term fetus. Both the partners were unaware of the ongoing pregnancy until diagnosed. She underwent emergency cesarean under general anaesthesia (GA) for nonreassuring CTG, severe chorioamnionitis, and moderate preecclampsia. A live male baby weighing 4400 grams delivered in poor condition. Placental tissue on culture exhibited scanty growth of pseudomonas aeruginosa. Chorioamnionitis due to pseudomonas is rare, with high neonatal morbidity and mortality. It is mostly reported among preterm prelabor rupture of membranes (PPROM). Educating the community especially morbidly obese women if they put on excessive weight or with irregular periods should seek doctor's advice and exclude pregnancy. For the primary care provider, it is of great importance to exclude pregnancy in any reproductive woman presenting with abdominal complaints. This case also brings to clinicians notice that pseudomonas can be community-acquired and can affect term pregnancies with intact or prolonged rupture of membranes.

The primary aim of this study was to assess the rate and load of amniotic fluid <i>Chlamydia trachomatis</i> DNA and their associations with intra-amniotic infection and intra-uterine inflammatory complications in women with preterm prelabor rupture of membranes (PPROM). The secondary aim was to assess the short-term morbidity of newborns from PPROM pregnancies complicated by amniotic fluid <i>C. trachomatis</i> DNA. A retrospective study of 788 women with singleton pregnancies complicated by PPROM between 24 + 0 and 36 + 6 weeks of gestation was performed. Transabdominal amniocenteses were performed at the time of admission. <i>C. trachomatis</i> DNA in the amniotic fluid was assessed by real-time polymerase chain reaction using a commercial AmpliSens® <i>C. trachomatis/Ureaplasma</i>/<i>Mycoplasma hominis</i>-FRT kit, and the level of Ct DNA was quantified. Amniotic fluid <i>C. trachomatis</i> DNA complicated 2% (16/788) of the PPROM pregnancies and was present in very low loads (median 57 copies DNA/mL). In addition to amniotic fluid <i>C. trachomatis</i> DNA, other bacteria were detected in 62% (10/16) of the <i>C. trachomatis</i> DNA-complicated PPROM pregnancies. Amniotic fluid <i>C. trachomatis</i> DNA was associated with intra-amniotic infection, histologic chorioamnionitis (HCA), and funisitis in 31%, 47%, and 33%, respectively. The presence of <i>C. trachomatis</i> DNA accompanied by <i>Ureaplasma</i> species in the amniotic fluid was associated with a higher rate of HCA than the presence of amniotic fluid <i>C. trachomatis</i> DNA alone. The composite neonatal morbidity in newborns from PPROM pregnancies with amniotic fluid <i>C. trachomatis</i> DNA was 31%. The presence of <i>C. trachomatis</i> DNA in the amniotic fluid is a relatively rare condition in PPROM. Amniotic fluid <i>C. trachomatis</i> DNA in PPROM is not related to intensive intra-amniotic and intr-auterine inflammatory responses or adverse short-term neonatal outcomes.

To determine the contribution of twin-to-twin transfusion syndrome (TTTS) to preterm birth (PTB) at <37 weeks of gestation among Japanese twin pregnancies. An observational study using 3241 MC-BA (monochorionic biamniotic) and 6581 BC (bichorionic biamniotic) twin pregnancies. We focused on TTTS, preterm premature rupture of membranes (PPROM), pregnancy-induced hypertension (PIH), and fetal sex as possible causes of PTB. PTB was more common in MC-BA than in BC twin pregnancies (66.9% vs. 57.6%, P<0.0001) whereas PTB after PPROM (8.0% vs. 10.0%) and PIH (5.7% vs. 5.9%) was not. PTB after TTTS occurred in 7.3% of women with MC-BA twins. PTB was significantly more common for male-male pairs than for female-female pairs among both MC-BA (69.2% vs. 64.7%) and BC (59.6% vs. 56.3%) twins. The elevated risk of PTB among MC-BA twins could be explained by the occurrence of TTTS.

Bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD), a major source of morbidity in premature neonates, has been associated with intrauterine infection and preterm birth. Both preterm premature rupture of membranes (PPROM) and spontaneous preterm labor (sPTL) are linked with intrauterine inflammation. Whether PPROM and sPTL, as two phenotypic categories of preterm birth, are associated with exposure to different degrees and durations of inflammation that might impact fetal lung development is unknown. PPROM may be associated with longer latency until delivery, which is beneficial for neonatal mortality, but may impart greater injury risk to the developing fetal lungs. It is unknown if PPROM is associated with a greater risk of adverse neonatal respiratory outcomes than sPTL. The objective of this study was to determine if PPROM imparts a differentially greater risk for neonatal BPD than sPTL. A secondary objective was to determine if PPROM was associated with a greater risk of adverse neonatal respiratory outcomes other than BPD and whether gestational latency following PPROM or sPTL diagnosis constitutes a risk factor for fetal lung injury. We conducted a retrospective secondary analysis of a large cohort of women at risk for spontaneous preterm birth, who were originally enrolled in a randomized controlled trial of magnesium sulfate versus placebo examining neuroprotection. For our study, we included women with a singleton pregnancy complicated by PPROM or sPTL and delivery between 24 and 34 weeks gestational age. Cases with multiple gestation, congenital anomalies, maternal seropositivity for human immunodeficiency virus, or hypertensive diseases of pregnancy (including preeclampsia) were excluded. The primary outcome was BPD. Secondary outcomes were respiratory distress syndrome (RDS), transient tachypnea of the newborn (TTN), requirement for mechanical ventilation, pneumonia, neonatal sepsis, fetal or neonatal death, and a composite of adverse neonatal respiratory outcomes including (BPD, pneumonia, RDS, and TTN). Statistical analyses included chi-square, Student's <i>t</i>-test and logistic and multiple regression. A total of 1729 women were included in this analysis including 1554 with PPROM and 175 with sPTL. Women in the PPROM group were more likely to be older, not of Hispanic race, married, more educated, have smoked during pregnancy and have a greater body mass index. The BPD rate was not significantly different following PPROM versus sPTL. Neonates in the PPROM group experienced a lower rate of pneumonia (<i>p</i> = .001), neonatal sepsis (<i>p</i> = .009) and patent ductus arterious (PDA) requiring either medical or surgical therapy (<i>p</i> < .001) than neonates in the sPTL group. Chorioamnionitis was more common in the PPROM group (<i>p</i> = .008) than the sPTL group. After multivariable logistic regression with BPD or composite of adverse neonatal respiratory outcomes as the dependent outcomes, and controlling for gestational age at delivery, maternal smoking history, duration of mechanical ventilation and RDS, there was no significant difference between PPROM and sPTL. BPD rates were not significantly different in neonates born to women following PPROM versus sPTL. However, PPROM was associated with lower rates of pneumonia, neonatal sepsis, and PDA requiring therapy in the univariate analysis, but not the multivariate analysis. Neonatal respiratory outcomes may have a similar phenotypic overlap regardless of whether preterm birth follows PPROM or sPTL.

Preterm premature rupture of membranes (PPROM) occurs in 3% of pregnancies and is responsible for one third of all preterm births. PPROM will affect 120,000 women in the United States each year. It is associated with significant maternal, fetal, and neonatal morbidity and mortality resulting from infection, umbilical cord compression, abruptio placentae, and prematurity. The etiology is multifactorial, but the most significant risk factors are previous preterm birth and previous preterm premature rupture of membranes. Accurate diagnosis is extremely important to assure proper treatment. Evaluation is based on patient history and clinical examination. This review presents the available evidence and grades it according to the U.S. Preventative Task Force recommendations. In part I of this review, the definition, pathophysiology, and methods of PPROM diagnosis are presented. In part II, the management, treatment, neonatal outcome, and the maternal and fetal evaluation of women with PPROM in the presence of cerclage and medical complications is reviewed. After completion of this article, the reader should be able to define the term: preterm premature rupture of membranes, to list the factors associated with premature rupture of membranes, and to outline the tests available for the diagnosis of intra-amniotic infection.

The purpose of this study was to examine the potential impact of severe Ovarian hyper stimulation syndrome (OHSS) on the risk of preterm birth. Severe ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome is a serious complication in the methods of in vitro fertilization. The pathophysiology of this process is not clear enough and the treatment is symptomatic. Human chorionic gonadotropin (h-CG) is the most important known cause of this condition. Findings of other authors often do not match when it comes to complications that may occur in pregnancy. In the Gynecology and Obstetrics Clinic "Narodni Front" a case control study was conducted on 50 female patients with severe forms of OHSS in the period from January 2008 to March 2015. A control group was created based on age and it involved 59 patients with pregnancy achieved with IVF/ICSI during the same period, but in which OHSS did not occur. Patients with the pregnancy complicated by OHSS, had a considerably higher rate of preterm labor, whether this was labor before gestation week 37 (56.0% vs. 30.5%) or before gestation week 34 (34.0% vs. 6.8%); significantly lower weight of newborns, as in the newborns with low body weight <2500g (45.6% vs. 25.0%) and specially in the newborn with very low body weight <1500 grams (19.1% vs. 3.8%), as well as preterm premature rupture of membranes (PPROM), (11.76% vs. 1.59%). Pregnancy achieved by the IVF/ICSI method in which severe form of OHSS has been developed could have an increased risk of preterm birth.

Preterm premature rupture of the membranes (PPROM) occurs in approximately 3% of all pregnancies, and accounts for one third of all preterm births. Despite its prevalence, optimal management of PPROM remains largely undefined and lacks conformity. In this article, we review the pathophysiology of PPROM, and summarize the available literature describing various management strategies in an effort to define current controversies in the management of PPROM.

Preterm premature rupture of membranes (PPROM) occurs in 1% to 2% of births. Impact of PPROM is greatest in low- and middle-income countries where prematurity-related deaths are most common. Recent investigations identify cytokine and matrix metalloproteinase activation, oxidative stress, and apoptosis as primary pathways to PPROM. These biological processes are initiated by heterogeneous etiologies including infection/inflammation, placental bleeding, uterine overdistention, and genetic polymorphisms. We hypothesize that pathways to PPROM overlap and act synergistically to weaken membranes. We focus our discussion on membrane composition and strength, pathways linking risk factors to membrane weakening, and future research directions to reduce the global burden of PPROM.

Preterm premature rupture of membranes (PPROM) is a condition leading to an increased risk of maternal and neonatal morbidity and mortality in pregnant women. To prevent this complication, some studies have proposed using prophylactic progesterone. However, due to lack of sufficient relevant data, there is still need for further studies in this regard. This study was performed to determine the effect of rectal progesterone on the latent phase and maternal and neonatal outcome variables in females with PPROM. During the present randomized clinical trial study (IRCT201512077676N4), a total of 120 patients with PPROM at pregnancy ages between 26 and 32 weeks were randomly assigned to 2 equal intervention and control groups. In the intervention group, progesterone suppositories (400 mg per night) were administered until delivery or completion of the 34th gestational week and was compared with placebo effect in control group. The latent phase and maternal and neonatal outcome variables were compared between the two groups. The mean age of patients was 29.56±5.66 (19-42) and 29.88±5.57 (17-40) years in the intervention and control group, respectively. The two groups were almost identical in the confounding factors. The median latent phase was 8.5 days in the intervention group vs. 5 days in the control group in the 28th-30th weeks of gestation, which was significantly higher in the intervention group (P=0.001). Among maternal and neonatal outcome variables, only the mean birth-weight was significantly higher in the intervention group than that in the controls (1609.92±417.28 gr vs. 1452.03±342.35 gr, P=0.03). Administration of progesterone suppository in patients with PPROM at gestational ages of 28 to 30 weeks is effective in elongating the latent phase and increasing birth-weight with no significant complications.

To determine whether preterm premature rupture of membranes (PPROM) before 24 weeks is an independent risk factor for poor outcome in preterm neonates. A retrospective comparative cohort study was conducted, including viable premature infants born between 25 and 34-weeks gestation. Each preterm case with early PPROM was matched with two preterm controls of the same gestational age at birth, sex and birth date and who were born spontaneously with intact membranes. Logistic regression was performed to identify independent risk factors associated with composite respiratory and perinatal adverse outcomes for the overall population of preterm infants. Thirty-five PPROM cases were matched with 70 controls. Extreme prematurity (26-28 weeks) was an independent risk factor for composite perinatal adverse outcomes [odds ratio (OR) 43.9; p = 0.001]. Extreme prematurity (OR 42.9; p = 0.001), PPROM (OR 7.1; p = 0.01), male infant (OR 5.2; p = 0.02) and intrauterine growth restriction (IUGR, OR 4.8; p = 0.04) were factors for composite respiratory adverse outcomes. Preterm premature rupture of membranes before viability represents an independent risk factor for composite respiratory adverse outcomes in preterm neonates. Extreme prematurity may represent the main risk factor for both composite respiratory and perinatal adverse outcomes.

Preterm premature rupture of membranes (PPROM) is defined as the rupture of fetal membranes before 37 weeks. Extreme PPROM occurs before 26 weeks' gestation and can result in perinatal morbidity and mortality. The aim of this study was to study the perinatal outcomes of mothers with extreme PPROM. A retrospective cohort study of 44 consecutive pregnant women, presenting with PPROM before 26 weeks' gestation, was conducted from January 2006 to December 2011 at Sultan Qaboos University Hospital, Oman. Maternal and neonatal information was collected from medical records, and delivery and neonatal unit registries. Women with PPROM presenting after 26 weeks' gestation, those with multiple gestations, or other types of preterm deliveries were excluded from the study. Of the 44 preterm infants admitted to the Neonatal Intensive Care Unit, 24 (55%) survived, 7 (16%) died within 24 hours of birth, 9 (20%) were miscarried, and 4 (9%) were stillbirths. Neonatal sepsis and pulmonary hypoplasia were the major causes of death. Neonatal complications among the surviving infants included prematurity in 11 (46%), respiratory distress syndrome in 19 (79%), sepsis in 12 (50%), and low birth weight in 11 (46%). The neonatal survival rate was significantly associated with the gestational age at delivery but not with the gestational age upon rupture of membranes. Extreme PPROM was associated with adverse perinatal outcomes. The results of this study will help obstetricians and neonatologists in counselling couples experiencing PPROM. Future studies of long-term neonatal morbidity should have larger sample sizes and include more hospitals.

The preterm premature rupture of membranes (PPROM) is a common condition in pregnant women and is associated with significant maternal and perinatal morbidity. Most of the time, the diagnosis is done during physical examination. However, in 10%-20% of equivocal cases, biological markers are needed to confirm the diagnosis, especially when leakage of fluid is low or intermittent. In these cases, a quick and reliable diagnosis is necessary for applying the appropriate measures to reduce perinatal complications. The prognosis in PPROM is linked to maternal inflammatory markers that might predict perinatal infection, and therefore be helpful to decide the timing of the delivery. Nevertheless, further research is needed to identify robust biological markers for the diagnosis of PPROM in equivocal cases and for the prognosis.
