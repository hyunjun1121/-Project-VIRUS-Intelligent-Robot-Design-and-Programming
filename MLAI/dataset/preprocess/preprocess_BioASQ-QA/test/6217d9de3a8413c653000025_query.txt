Kawasaki disease (KD) is a systemic vasculitis of unknown etiology which predominantly affects medium- and small-sized muscular arteries. Histopathologic studies of KD vasculitis lesions have demonstrated characteristic T cell infiltration and an abundance of CD8 T cells; however, the contribution of cytotoxic lymphocytes to KD vasculitis lesions has not been identified. Here, we histopathologically and immunohistochemically examined infiltrating inflammatory cells, particularly cytotoxic protein-positive cells, such as granzyme B cells and TIA-1 cells, in KD vasculitis lesions. Three autopsy specimens with acute-phase KD were observed and contained 24 vasculitis lesions affecting medium-sized muscular arteries, excluding pulmonary arteries. Infiltrating neutrophils in vasculitis lesions were evaluated by hematoxylin and eosin staining, and monocytes/macrophages and lymphocytes were evaluated by immunohistochemistry. The predominant cells were CD163 monocytes/macrophages and CD3 T cells. CD8 T cells, granzyme B cells, and TIA-1 cells were also observed, but CD56 natural killer cells were rare. To the best of our knowledge, the current study is the first histopathologic report confirming the infiltration of inflammatory cells with cytotoxic proteins in vasculitis lesions in patients with KD. Cytotoxic T cells may play a role in the development of vasculitis lesions in KD patients.

Granzyme B is known to be a serine protease contained in granules of cytotoxic T cells. We have previously reported an influence of granzyme B expression in T regulatory cells (Tregs) on the risk of acute graft versus host disease (GVHD) onset. However, it is still unknown if conventional T cells (Tcon) use the granzyme B pathway as a mechanism of alloimmunity. We hypothesized that granzyme B in Tcon may affect recurrence within the first 6 months after allogeneic transplantation (allo-HSCT). A total of 65 patients with different hematological malignancies were included in this study. Blood samples were collected on day +30 after allo-HSCT. The percentage of granzyme B positive conventional T cells in patients who developed relapse in the first 6 months after allo-HSCT was 11.3 (4.5-35.3) compared to the others in continuous complete remission-1.3 (3.65-9.7), р = 0.011. The risk of relapse after allo-HSCT was in 3.9 times higher in patients with an increased percentage of granzyme B positive conventional T cells. The findings demonstrated that the percentage of granzyme B positive conventional T cells on day +30 after allo-HSCT could be a predictable marker of relapse within the first 6 months after allo-HSCT.

The tumor microenvironment (TME) and limited immune surveillance play important roles in lymphoma pathogenesis. Here we aimed to characterize immunological profiles of diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) and predict the outcome in response to immunochemotherapy. We profiled the expression of 730 immune-related genes in tumor tissues of 81 patients with DLBCL utilizing the Nanostring platform, and used multiplex immunohistochemistry to characterize T-cell phenotypes, including cytotoxic T cells (CD8, Granzyme B, OX40, Ki67), T-cell immune checkpoint (CD3, CD4, CD8, PD1, TIM3, LAG3), as well as regulatory T-cells and Th1 effector cells (CD3, CD4, FOXP3, TBET) in 188 patients. We observed a high degree of heterogeneity at the transcriptome level. Correlation matrix analysis identified gene expression signatures with highly correlating genes, the main cluster containing genes for cytolytic factors, immune checkpoint molecules, T cells and macrophages, together named a TME immune cell signature. Immunophenotyping of the distinct cell subsets revealed that a high proportion of immune checkpoint positive T cells translated to unfavorable survival. Together, our results demonstrate that the immunological profile of DLBCL TME is heterogeneous and clinically meaningful. This highlights the potential impact of T-cell immune checkpoint in regulating survival and resistance to immunochemotherapy.

To date, the mechanisms of inflammation have been poorly studied in fish of commercial interest, due to the lack of development of appropriate experimental models. The current study evaluated a local inflammation triggered by a polymeric carrageenin mixture (a mucopolysaccharide derived from the red seaweed Chondrus crispus) in the skin of gilthead seabream (Sparus aurata). Fish were injected subcutaneously with phosphate-buffered saline (as control) or λ/κ-carrageenin (1%), and skin samples from the injection sites were collected 1.5, 3 and 6 hr post-injection, processed for inclusion in paraplast and stained with haematoxylin-eosin, Alcian blue or periodic acid-Schiff. Furthermore, immunohistochemistry and expression analyses of several cells' markers and proinflammatory genes were also analysed in samples of the injected sites. Microscopic results indicated an increased number of skin mucus-secreting cells and acidophilic granulocytes in the skin of fish studied at 1.5 hr and 3 hr post-injection with carrageenin, respectively, with respect to the data obtained in control fish. Otherwise, both the gene expression of the non-specific cytotoxic cell marker (granzyme B, grb) and the proinflammatory cytokine (interleukin-1β, il-1β) were up-regulated at 1.5 hr in the skin of fish injected with carrageenin compared with the control fish, whilst the gene expression of acidophilic granulocyte markers (NADPH oxidase subunit Phox22 and Phox40, phox22 and phox40) was up-regulated at 3 and 6 hr in the carrageenin group, compared with the control group. In addition, the gene expression of myeloperoxidase (mpo) was also up-regulated at 6 hr in the skin of fish injected with carrageenin in comparison with control samples. The present results indicate the chronological participation of two important immune cells involved in the resolution of the inflammation in the skin of gilthead seabream.

The chronic course of endometriosis suggests that the immune system may play a role in its aetiology. There may be resistance to cell lysis, as well as an immune defect underlying endometriosis. Granzyme B is a serine protease that is secreted by Natural Killer (NK) cells and cytotoxic T lymphocytes during a cellular immune response and can induce apoptosis. The aim of this study was to evaluate the relationship between both Granzyme B levels and Granzyme B gene polymorphisms in endometriosis patients. Women between the ages of 20 - 45 were included in the study. The patients were divided into two groups: those diagnosed with endometriosis and those who had not been diagnosed with endometriosis. In the blood samples, Granzyme B gene polymorphisms and serum levels of Granzyme B were studied. There was no difference between the groups in terms of median Granzyme B levels and the presence of AA, AG, and GG genotypes. There was a difference in median granzyme levels for the control group; the GG genotype was found at a lower frequency. The immune defect within endometriosis-related immune cells may not be exclusively due to Granzyme B. Other mediators that are secreted from immune cells may have additive effects.IMPACT STATEMENT<b>What is already known on this subject?</b> NK cells are cytotoxic and inhibit the implantation of autologous endometrial cells that are spilled into the peritoneum by retrograde menstruation. Thus, a reduction in NK cell activity may facilitate the progression of endometriosis. The literature review reveals that there are studies suggesting that NK cell activity may be insufficient in endometriosis. Granzyme B is a serine protease that is secreted by NK cells and cytotoxic T lymphocytes during a cellular immune response.<b>What do the results of this study add?</b> Granzyme B is one of the cytotoxic granules in NK and cytotoxic T lymphocyte cells and its genetic polymorphisms were tested in endometriosis. We found that median Granzyme B levels were significantly different in patients with the GG genotype in the control group, compared to those with the AA and AG genotype. However, this difference was not detected between the control and endometriosis groups.<b>What are the implications of these findings for clinical practice and/or further research?</b> Our results contribute to uncovering the pathogenesis of endometriosis since there are no previous studies in the literature regarding this topic. Although we did not find a difference, our results will inform further studies made on this topic. Studies with different molecules and an increased number of patients are needed. The immune defect of endometriosis may not be due exclusively to Granzyme B. Other mediators that are secreted from immune cells may have mutual effects and interactions.

Immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICI) therapies have demonstrated significant benefit in the treatment of many tumors including high grade urothelial cancer (HGUC) of the bladder. However, variability in patients' clinical responses highlights the need for biomarkers to aid patient stratification. ICI relies on an intact host immune response. In this context, we hypothesize that key players in the antitumor immune response such as markers of activated cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CD8, granzyme-B) and immune suppression (FOXP3) may help to identify patients who will derive the greatest therapeutic benefit from ICI. A major obstacle for deployment of such a strategy is the limited quantities of tumor-derived biopsy material. Therefore, in this technical study, we develop a multiplex biomarker with digital workflow. We explored the (1) concordance of conventional single stain results using digital image analysis, and (2) agreement between digital scoring versus manual analysis. (1) For concordance study of single and multiplex stains, triplicate core tissue microarrays of 207 muscle invasive, HGUC of bladder had sequential 4-micron sections cut and stained with CD8, FOXP3 and granzyme-B. An inhouse developed tri-chromogen multiplex immunohistochemistry (m-IHC) assay consisting of CD8 (green), granzyme B (brown), and FOXP3 (red) was used to stain the next sequential tissue section. (2) Agreement between manual and digital analysis was performed on 19 whole slide sections of HGUC cystectomy specimens. All slides were scanned using Aperio ScanScope AT Digital Scanner at 40X. Quantitative digital image analysis was performed using QuPath version 0.2.3 open-source software. Scores from triplicate cores were averaged for each HGUC specimen for each marker. Intraclass correlation coefficients were used to compare percent positive cells between the single- and multi-plex assays. Lin's concordance correlation coefficients were used for manual versus digital analysis. m-IHC offers significant advantages in characterizing the host immune microenvironment particularly in limited biopsy tissue material. Utilizing a digital image workflow resulted in significant concordance between m-IHC and individual single stains (p < 0.001 for all assessments). Moderate to good agreements were achieved between manual and digital scoring. Our technical work demonstrated potential uses of multiplex marker in assessing the host immune status and could be used in conjunction with PD-L1 as a predictor of response to ICI therapy.
