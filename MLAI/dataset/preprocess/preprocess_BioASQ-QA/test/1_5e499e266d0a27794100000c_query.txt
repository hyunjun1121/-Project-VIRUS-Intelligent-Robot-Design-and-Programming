Chronic drug abuse and sexual dysfunction specifically erectile dysfunction may lead drug abusers to seek over-the-counter or non-prescription medications, out of which Sildenafil citrate, sold as the trade name of ViagraÂ® can be considered as a prime and important treatment. Therefore, the research purpose was to draw a comparison and review the role of methamphetamine abuse and sildenafil use in increasing the likelihood of high-risk sexual behaviors (both concomitant and non-concomitant use). Hence, a total of 40 patients diagnosed with methamphetamine abuse were recruited through the administration of structured clinical interview for DSM-IV (Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, 4th Edition), through purposive sampling and subsequent to being qualified in accordance with the selection criteria by psychologists and general practitioners. All the 40 drug abusers (20 methamphetamine abusers with concomitant use of Aphrodisiac drugs (sexual stimulant pills) and 20 methamphetamine abusers) described their sexual risk behaviors subsequent to the drug use. Supported the between-group difference that is to say that, the group with concomitant methamphetamine abuse differed significantly in all the items when compared with the control group. However, this group scored lower on the item of sexual intercourse with drug addicted prostitutes using condom and both groups demonstrated high pick on this item. Overall, the concomitant methamphetamine chronic abuse with sexual stimulant drugs generates Aphrodisiac drugs impulses and is found to be related to higher frequencies of sexual risk behaviors and sexual intercourse with addicted prostitutes.
