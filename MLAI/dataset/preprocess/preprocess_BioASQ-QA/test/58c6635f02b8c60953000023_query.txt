What is the inheritance of the glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD) deficiency?

[PMID: 25116429]
Glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD) deficiency is an X-linked recessive genetic defect that can cause hemolytic crisis. However, this disease affects both males and females. In Turkey, the frequency of this enzyme deficiency was reported to vary, from 0.25 to 18%, by the geographical area. Its prevalence in the northern Black Sea region of Turkey is unknown. The aims of this study were to assess the prevalence of G6PD deficiency in the northern region Turkey in children and adults with hyperbilirubinemia and hemolytic anemia. This report included a total of 976 G6PD enzyme results that were analyzed between May 2005 and January 2014. G6PD deficiency was detected in 5.0% of all patients. G6PD deficiency was significantly less frequent in females (1.9%, 6/323) than in males (6.6%, 43/653). G6PD deficiency was detected in 3.7% of infants with hyperbilirubinemia, 9.2% of children, and 4.5% of adults with hemolytic anemia. In both the newborn group and the group of children, G6PD deficiency was significantly more frequent in males. In the combined group of children (groups I and II), the proportion of males was 74% and 67% in all groups (P = .0008). In conclusion, in northern region of Turkey, G6PD deficiency is an important cause of neonatal hyperbilirubinemia and hemolytic crisis in children and adults. This study suggests that most pediatricians thought that G6PD deficiency is exclusively a male disease. For this reason, some female patients may have been undiagnosed.

Severe red cell glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G-6-PD) deficiency has been found in an 'aboriginal' Finnish family. 2 male and 9 female carriers of the variant G-6-PD were studied. The genetic pattern is consistent with x-linked recessive inheritance and the defect is associated with drug (primaquine) induced haemolysis. This was demonstrated by enzyme deficient red cell (51Cr-labelled) survival studies on a normal volunteer recipient. In addition, one of the hemizygotes studied had a slight chronic nonspherocytic haemolytic disorder. The partially purified enzyme had many of the characteristics of G-6-PD Mediterranean. The occurrence of this G-6-PD Mediterranean type variant in the Finnish population, which differs greatly from Mediterranean ethnic groups, as well as the association of slight chronic haemolysis with severe G-6-PD deficiency is discussed.

This is a report about a 9 year old turkish boy suffering from recurrent episodes of high fever caused by Plasmodium vivax-infection (Malaria tertiana), 12 months after returning from his malarious homeland. After a 3-day course of Chloroquin, we administrated Primaquin to eliminate residual extraerythrocyte forms of Plasmodium vivax. On the 7th day of treatment acute haemolysis developped. This was caused by Glucose-6-Phosphate-Dehydrogenase-Deficiency, which could be demonstrated by a red-cell-enzyme analysis. The investigation of the patient's whole family showed the typical recessive X-linked inheritance of this enzyme-defect. Frequency and clinical manifestations of this defect are discussed.

Glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD) deficiency is the commonest red cell enzymopathy in humans and has an X-linked inheritance. It has been reported from India more than 30 years ago and the prevalence varies from 0-27% in different caste, ethnic and linguistic groups. The major clinical manifestations are drug induced hemolytic anemia, neonatal jaundice and chronic non-spherocytic hemolytic anemia. Individuals with G6PD deficiency have a selective advantage against falciparum malaria. Thirteen biochemically characterized variants have been reported from India. At the molecular level, G6PD Mediterranean is the most common deficient variant in the caste groups whereas, G6PD Orissa is more prevalent among the tribal of India. The third common variant seen in India is G6PD Kerala-Kalyan.

Glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD) deficiency is an X-linked recessive hemolytic anemia caused by a mutation in the G6PD gene on Xq28. Herein, we describe a Korean boy with G6PD deficiency resulting from a novel mutation in G6PD. A 20-month-old boy with hemolytic anemia was referred for molecular diagnosis. He had no relevant family history. The G6PD activity was severely decreased at 0.2 U/g Hb (severe deficiency). Direct sequencing analyses on the G6PD gene revealed that he was hemizygous for a novel missense variant, c.1187C>G (p.Pro396Arg), in exon 10 of G6PD. Family study involving his parents revealed the de novo occurrence of the mutation. This is the first report of genetically confirmed G6PD deficiency in Korea.

Mouse chimeras from embryonic stem cells in which the X-linked glucose 6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD) gene had been targeted were crossed with normal females. First-generation (F(1)) G6PD(+/-) heterozygotes born from this cross were essentially normal; analysis of their tissues demonstrated strong selection for cells with the targeted G6PD allele on the inactive X chromosome. When these F(1) G6PD(+/-) females were bred to normal males, only normal G6PD mice were born, because: (i) hemizygous G6PD(-) male embryos died by E10.5 and their development was arrested from E7.5, the time of onset of blood circulation; (ii) heterozygous G6PD(+/-) females showed abnormalities from E8.5, and died by E11.5; and (iii) severe pathological changes were present in the placenta of both G6PD(-) and G6PD(+/-) embryos. Thus, G6PD is not indispensable for early embryo development; however, severe G6PD deficiency in the extraembryonic tissues (consequent on selective inactivation of the normal paternal G6PD allele) impairs the development of the placenta and causes death of the embryo. Most importantly, G6PD is indispensable for survival when the embryo is exposed to oxygen through its blood supply.

Glucose-6-Phosphate Dehydrogenase (G6PD) gene is located at the X-chromosome at Xq28 and the disease is recessively inherited predominantly in males. More than 400 variants have been proposed based on clinical and enzymatic studies. The aim of the current study was to identify C563T mutation in G6PD-deficient newborns and to correlate the enzyme residual activity with the presence of the mutation. Some 1189 full-term neonates aged 3-5 days old were tested for G6PD activity in dried blood spots from Guthrie cards using a commercial kit. DNA extraction from Guthrie cards and mutation identification among the deficient samples were performed with current techniques. A total of 92 (7.7%) newborns were G6PD-deficient. In 46 (50%), the mutation C563T was identified. The residual activity in C563T hemizygote males (n = 28) was statistically significantly lower (1.23 ± 0.93 U/g Hb) than that in non-C563T G6PD-deficient males (n = 25) (4.01 ± 1.20 U/g Hb, p < 0.0001) and in controls (13.6 ± 2.9 U/g Hb, p < 0.0001). In C563T heterozygote females, the estimated enzyme activity was lower than that determined in non-C563T females. Male C563T hemizygotes suffer from G6PD deficiency and severe neonatal jaundice. G6PD activity showed statistically significant correlation with total bilirubin blood levels.

After having described in detail the pathophysiology, symptomatology, X-chromosomal inheritance and some laboratory methods in detecting G-6-PD-deficiency by demonstrating a case of favism (Schulz et al. 1977), the authors now discuss the particularities of the enzyme deficiency in the newborn. These are complicated by additional physiological and transient deficiency of the enzymes catalase, NAD-diaphorase, glutathione peroxidase, and glucuronyl transferase. Several chemical substances, acidosis, hypoxia, hypoglycemia, and immaturity may cause a severe hyperbilirubinemia in G-6-PD-deficient newborns. The development of a kern-icterus in these cases may be prevented by early exchange transfusion. From clinical findings and some observations in different regions of Greece an additional factor influencing the liver function has been postulated which favors the development of hyperbilirubinemias in G-6-PD-deficient newborns. The nature of this possible factor is discussed. The authors emphasize the necessity of screening for G-6-PD-deficiency during pregnancy in families of mediterranian descent.

Glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD) deficiency is one of the most common human genetic abnormalities, and it has a significant prevalence in the male population (X chromosome linked). The purpose of this study was to estimate the frequency of impaired fasting glucose and diabetes among G6PD-deficient persons in Manaus, Brazil, an area in the Western Brazilian Amazon to which malaria is endemic. Glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase-deficient males had more impaired fasting glucose and diabetes. This feature could be used as a screening tool for G6PD-deficient persons who are unable to use primaquine for the radical cure of Plasmodium vivax malaria.

Patients affected with X chromosome-linked, hereditary glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD) deficiency suffer from life-threatening hemolytic crises after intake of certain drugs or foods. G6PD deficiency is associated with low levels of reduced glutathione. We analyzed mononuclear white blood cells (MNC) of three males suffering from the German G6PD Aachen variant, four heterozygote females of this family, one G6PD-deficient male from another family coming from Iran, and six healthy male volunteers with respect to their DNA damage in two different genes (G6PD and T-cell receptor-delta) and their propensity to enter apoptosis after UV illumination (0.08-5.28 J/cm2). As determined by PCR stop assays, there was more UV-induced DNA damage in MNC of G6PD-deficient male patients than in those of healthy subjects. MNC of G6PD-deficient patients showed a higher rate of apoptosis after UV irradiation than MNC of healthy donors. MNC of heterozygote females showed intermediate rates of DNA damage and apoptosis. It is concluded that increased DNA damage may be a result of deficient detoxification of reactive oxygen species by glutathione and may ultimately account for the higher rate of apoptosis in G6PD-deficient MNC.

The aims of this study were to determine the prevalence of glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD) deficiency in the United Arab Emirates (UAE), to describe the different mutations in the population, to determine its prevalence, and to study inheritance patterns in families of G6PD-deficient individuals. All infants born at Tawam Hospital, Al-Ain, UAE from January 1994 to September 1996 were screened at birth for their G6PD status. In addition, those attending well-baby clinics during the period were also screened for the disorder. Families of 40 known G6PD-deficient individuals, selected randomly from the records of three hospitals in the country, were assessed for G6PD deficiency. Where appropriate, this was followed by definition of G6PD mutations. Of 8198 infants, 746 (9.1%), comprising 15% of males and 5% of females tested, were found to be G6PD deficient. A total of 27 families were further assessed: of these, all but one family had the nt563 Mediterranean mutation. In one family, two individuals had the nt202 African mutation. The high manifestation of G6PD deficiency in women may be due to the preferential expression of the G6PD-deficient gene and X-inactivation of the normal gene, and/or to the presence of an 'enhancer' gene that makes the expression of the G6PD deficiency more likely. The high level of consanguinity which, theoretically, should result in a high proportion of homozygotes and consequently a higher proportion of females with the deficiency, was not found to be a significant factor.

Five hundred members belonging to the Bania community of Punjab were screened for erythrocytic glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G-6-PD) deficiency. The incidence of enzyme deficiency in males was 2.84 per cent and in females 2.75 per cent, with an overall incidence of 2.80 per cent. No correlation between age and G-6-PD deficiency was found. The mean values for haemoglobin and haematocrit did not differ significantly in the normal and deficient subjects. Study of the deficiency pattern amongst family members of the enzyme deficient subjects confirmed the X-linked inheritance of G-6-PD deficiency.

Glucose 6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD) is a cytosolic enzyme encoded by a housekeeping X-linked gene whose main function is to produce NADPH, a key electron donor in the defense against oxidizing agents and in reductive biosynthetic reactions. Inherited G6PD deficiency is associated with either episodic hemolytic anemia (triggered by fava beans or other agents) or life-long hemolytic anemia. We show here that an evolutionary analysis is a key to understanding the biology of a housekeeping gene. From the alignment of the amino acid (aa) sequence of 52 glucose 6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD) species from 42 different organisms, we found a striking correlation between the aa replacements that cause G6PD deficiency in humans and the sequence conservation of G6PD: two-thirds of such replacements are in highly and moderately conserved (50-99%) aa; relatively few are in fully conserved aa (where they might be lethal) or in poorly conserved aa, where presumably they simply would not cause G6PD deficiency. This is consistent with the notion that all human mutants have residual enzyme activity and that null mutations are lethal at some stage of development. Comparing the distribution of mutations in a human housekeeping gene with evolutionary conservation is a useful tool for pinpointing amino acid residues important for the stability or the function of the corresponding protein. In view of the current explosive increase in full genome sequencing projects, this tool will become rapidly available for numerous other genes.

Glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD) is a metabolic enzyme involved in the pentose phosphate pathway, its especially important in red blood cell metabolism. Glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase deficiency is an X-linked recessive hereditary disease characterised by abnormally low levels of G6PD. About 400 million people worldwide have a deficiency of this enzyme. The remarkable geographic correlation of G6PD deficiency distribution with historical endemicity patterns of malaria has led to suggestions that the two could be linked. Some studies have concluded that G6PD deficiency confers resistance to malaria. To determine the prevalence of G6PD deficiency, and determine its relationship with prevalence and incidence of P. falciparum infection among children in Uganda. This was longitudinal study involving 245 children, 135 were actively followed up for 12 months. G6PD status was assessed for using PCR-RFLP method. A thick smear was done to determine presence of plasmodium trophozoites and parasite densities. A total of 245 children between 6 months and 9 years were recruited. Of these 46.5% were males. Overall prevalence for the X-linked G6PD A- mutation was; 79.59% wild type, 12.65% heterozygous and 7.76% homozygous or hemizygous. Among the males 14% were hemizygous. At baseline, 40.8% had asymptomatic P falciparum infection. There was no statistically significant difference in prevalence and incidence rates of malaria infection among the different G6PD genotypes with prevalence among heterozygous, homozygous, and wild type being 29%, 42.6% and 43% respectively (p = 0.11) and incidence among heterozygous and wild type being 0.56 and 0.52 episodes/year (p = 0.5). The heterozygous G6PD A- females had a lower parasite density compared to the wild type (2505 vs 941 parasites/μL; P = 0.024). This study showed that 20.41% of the population in this part of Uganda carry the G6PD A-mutation, within the range of 15-32% seen in other parts of Africa. P. falciparum infection incidence and prevalence rates are similar among the G6PD genotypes though, once infected, P. falciparum parasite densities are lowest among G6PD A- heterozygous females. This suggests differences in P. falciparum infection rates and severity of disease could be mediated by differences in parasite densities among the different G6PD genotypes.

Glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD) deficiency is an X-linked recessive disorder in which haemolytic anaemia is the major symptom. The Beutler spot test employed in mass-screening for galactosaemia in newborns requires several intrinsic erythrocyte enzymes such as G6PD for its reaction and can theoretically detect G6PD deficiency apart from galactose-1-phosphate uridyltransferase deficiency. In this study, we detected two patients with G6PD deficiency using the quantitative Beutler test which was recently developed in our laboratory. Both patients lacked erythrocyte G6PD activity but exhibited no clinical symptoms. Molecular analysis in patients 1 and 2 revealed two novel missense mutations of C853T causing R285C and A1220C causing K407T, respectively. Molecular rather than enzymatic analysis was required in familial studies to detect and diagnose the carrier state. To date these patients have avoided oxidant stress and haemolytic diatheses have not been induced. Our results indicate that the quantitative Beutler test can detect glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase deficiency of class 1 and 2 and is therefore useful for early intervention and prevention of haemolytic diathesis in patients with this disorder.

Erythrocytic glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD) of a mutant mouse strain with X-linked G6PD-deficiency was purified and compared with the wildtype G6PD by biochemical and physiological characteristics. The red cell G6PD activity of the mutant was 20% of the wildtype. The Michaelis constant (Km) of the substrate glucose-6-phosphate (G6P) was higher (90 microM) for the mutant than for the wildtype (56 microM). The isoelectric focusing with a pH range from 3 to 10 showed one more enzymatically active band for the wildtype G6PD compared to the mutant enzyme. Other enzyme characteristics, however, such as Km for nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NADP), utilisation of 2-deoxy-glucose-6-phosphate (2dG6P) and deamino-NADP, heat stability, pH optimum, molecular weight, and glucose metabolisation via the pentosephosphate pathway were similar in mutant and wildtype enzyme.

Glucosephosphate isomerase (GPI) deficiency in humans is an autosomal recessive disorder, which results in nonspherocytic hemolytic anemia of variable clinical expression. A 4-year-old female with severe congenital hemolytic anemia had low red cell GPI activity of 15.5 IU/g Hb (50% of normal mean) indicating GPI deficiency. Subsequent DNA sequence analysis revealed a novel homozygous 921C to G mutation in the GPI gene sequence, predicting a Phe307 to Leu replacement. Strikingly, the red cell GPI activity in this patient was higher than that found in a second patient expressing the same GPI variant, with a more severe clinical phenotype. We propose that the hemolysis in the first patient may be modified by an accompanying deficiency of glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD). The proband's red cell G6PD activity was reduced at 4.5 IU/g Hb (50% of normal mean) and molecular studies revealed heterozygosity for the G6PD Viangchan mutation and a skewed pattern of X-chromosome inactivation, producing almost exclusive expression of the mutated allele. The G6PD Viangchan variant is characterised by severe enzyme deficiency, but not chronic hemolysis. This study suggests that the metabolic consequences of a combined deficiency of GPI and G6PD might be responsible for a different clinical outcome than predicted for either defect in isolation.
