When did FDA approve the first B-cell maturation antigen-targeted CAR-T cell therapy?

[PMID: 34549909]
Chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T-cell therapy has quickly emerged as a highly promising treatment for patients with relapsed and refractory multiple myeloma. There are numerous candidates under development, each with their unique characteristics and points of differentiation. The most recent US Food and Drug Administration approval of the first B-cell maturation antigen-targeted CAR-T cell therapy on March 26, 2021, has paved a path forward for the eventual evaluation of more of these investigational agents undergoing clinical trials. Herein, we highlight, from a clinical development perspective, the CAR-T cell therapies farthest along in development with updated data from the American Society of Hematology 2020 annual meeting. We also discuss potential paths of overcoming resistance to these therapies and the future direction for CAR-T cell therapeutics in multiple myeloma.

Chimeric antigen receptor T (CART) cells targeting CD19 have shown promising results in the treatment of chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL). However, efficacy seems to be inferior compared to diffuse large B-cell lymphoma or acute lymphoblastic leukemia. Impaired T-cell fitness of CLL patients may be involved in treatment failure. Less-differentiated naïve-like T cells play an important role in CART expansion and long-term persistence in vivo. These cells are sparse in CLL patients. Therefore, optimization of CART cell production protocols enriching less differentiated T cell subsets may overcome treatment resistance. The B-cell receptor inhibitor ibrutinib targeting Bruton's tyrosine kinase (BTK) is approved for the treatment of CLL. Besides BTK, ibrutinib additionally inhibits interleukin-2-inducible T-cell kinase (ITK) which is involved in T-cell differentiation. To evaluate the effect of ibrutinib on CART cell production, peripheral blood mononuclear cells from nine healthy donors and eight CLL patients were used to generate CART cells. T-cell expansion and phenotype, expression of homing and exhaustion makers as well as functionality of CART cells were evaluated. CART cell generation in the presence of ibrutinib resulted in increased cell viability and expansion of CLL patient-derived CART cells. Furthermore, ibrutinib enriched CART cells with less-differentiated naïve-like phenotype and decreased expression of exhaustion markers including PD-1, TIM-3 and LAG-3. In addition, ibrutinib increased the cytokine release capacity of CLL patient-derived CART cells. In summary, BTK/ITK inhibition with ibrutinib during CART cell culture can improve yield and function of CLL patient-derived CART cell products.
