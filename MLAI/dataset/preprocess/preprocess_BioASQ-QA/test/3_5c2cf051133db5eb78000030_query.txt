How many pseudogenes are contained in the C. elegans genome?

[PMID: 11997343]
Only a minority of the genes, identified in the Caenorhabditis elegans genome sequence data by computer analysis, have been characterized experimentally. We attempted to determine the expression patterns for a random sample of the annotated genes using reporter gene fusions. A low success rate was obtained for evolutionarily recently duplicated genes. Analysis of the data suggests that this is not due to conditional or low-level expression. The remaining explanation is that most of the annotated genes in the recently duplicated category are pseudogenes, a proportion corresponding to 20% of all of the annotated C. elegans genes. Further support for this surprisingly high figure was sought by comparing sequences for families of recently duplicated C. elegans genes. Although only a preliminary analysis, clear evidence for a gene having been recently inactivated by genetic drift was found for many genes in the recently duplicated category. At least 4% of the annotated C. elegans genes can be recognized as pseudogenes simply from closer inspection of the sequence data. Lessons learned in identifying pseudogenes in C. elegans could be of value in the annotation of the genomes of other species where, although there may be fewer pseudogenes, they may be harder to detect.

The aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AHR) functions in higher organisms in development, metabolism and toxic responses. Its Caenorhabditis elegans (C. elegans) ortholog, AHR-1, facilitates neuronal development, growth and movement. We investigated the effect of AHR mutation on the transcriptional profile of L4 stage C. elegans using RNA-seq and quantitative real time PCR in order to understand better AHR-1 function at the genomic level. Illumina HiSeq 2000 sequencing yielded 51.1, 61.2 and 54.0 million reads from wild-type controls, ahr-1(ia03) and ahr-1(ju145) mutants, respectively, providing detection of over 18,000 transcripts in each sample. Fourteen transcripts were over-expressed and 125 under-expressed in both ahr-1 mutants when compared to wild-type. Under-expressed genes included soluble guanylate cyclase (gcy) family genes, some of which were previously demonstrated to be regulated by AHR-1. A neuropeptide-like protein gene, nlp-20, and a F-box domain protein gene fbxa-192 and its pseudogenes fbxa-191 and fbxa-193 were also under-expressed. Conserved xenobiotic response elements were identified in the 5' flanking regions of some but not all of the gcy, nlp-20, and fbxa genes. These results extend previous studies demonstrating control of gcy family gene expression by AHR-1, and furthermore suggest a role of AHR-1 in regulation of a neuropeptide gene as well as pseudogenes.

Messenger RNAs (mRNAs) that contain premature translation termination codons (PTCs) are targeted for rapid degradation in all eukaryotes tested. The mechanisms of nonsense-mediated mRNA decay (NMD) have been described in considerable detail, but the biological roles of NMD in wild-type organisms are poorly understood. mRNAs of wild-type organisms known to be degraded by NMD ("natural targets" of NMD) include by-products of regulated alternative splicing, out-of-frame mRNAs derived from unproductive gene rearrangements, cytoplasmic pre-mRNAs, endogenous retroviral and transposon RNAs, and mRNAs having upstream open reading frames or other unusual sequence features. NMD may function to eliminate aberrant PTC-containing mRNAs in order to protect cells from expression of potentially deleterious truncated proteins. Pseudogenes are nonfunctional genes or gene fragments that accumulate mutations through genetic drift. Such mutations will often introduce shifts of reading frame and/or PTCs, and mRNAs of expressed pseudogenes may thus be substrates of NMD. We demonstrate that mRNAs expressed from C. elegans pseudogenes are degraded by NMD and discuss possible implications for both mRNA surveillance and protein evolution. We describe an expressed pseudogene that encodes a small nucleolar RNA (snoRNA) within an intron and suggest this represents an evolutionary intermediate between snoRNA-encoding host genes that do or do not encode proteins.
