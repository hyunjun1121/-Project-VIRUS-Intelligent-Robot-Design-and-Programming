What disease can be treated with Avacopan?

[PMID: 33625803]
In the last few years, there has been a growing interest in the study of complement, fueleld mainly by the design of complement modulators, especially the C5-blocker eculizumab. The latter has significantly improved the prognosis of some nephropathies, such as the atypical hemolytic uremic syndrome. This breakthrough is a perfect example of fundamental translational research leading to clinical applications for patients. Currently, new molecules are being developed and some of them have already demonstrated clinical efficacy, such as avacopan (C5aR blocker) in ANCA vasculitis. As for kidney transplantation, complement modulators may lead to a new perspective in the treatment of some complications, such as humoral rejection. However, complement modulators carry the side effects, especially the infectious, and high costs.

Alternative C activation is involved in the pathogenesis of ANCA-associated vasculitis. However, glucocorticoids used as treatment contribute to the morbidity and mortality of vasculitis. We determined whether avacopan (CCX168), an orally administered, selective C5a receptor inhibitor, could replace oral glucocorticoids without compromising efficacy. In this randomized, placebo-controlled trial, adults with newly diagnosed or relapsing vasculitis received placebo plus prednisone starting at 60 mg daily (control group), avacopan (30 mg, twice daily) plus reduced-dose prednisone (20 mg daily), or avacopan (30 mg, twice daily) without prednisone. All patients received cyclophosphamide or rituximab. The primary efficacy measure was the proportion of patients achieving a ≥50% reduction in Birmingham Vasculitis Activity Score by week 12 and no worsening in any body system. We enrolled 67 patients, 23 in the control and 22 in each of the avacopan groups. Clinical response at week 12 was achieved in 14 of 20 (70.0%) control patients, 19 of 22 (86.4%) patients in the avacopan plus reduced-dose prednisone group (difference from control 16.4%; two-sided 90% confidence limit, -4.3% to 37.1%; <i>P</i>=0.002 for noninferiority), and 17 of 21 (81.0%) patients in the avacopan without prednisone group (difference from control 11.0%; two-sided 90% confidence limit, -11.0% to 32.9%; <i>P</i>=0.01 for noninferiority). Adverse events occurred in 21 of 23 (91%) control patients, 19 of 22 (86%) patients in the avacopan plus reduced-dose prednisone group, and 21 of 22 (96%) patients in the avacopan without prednisone group. In conclusion, C5a receptor inhibition with avacopan was effective in replacing high-dose glucocorticoids in treating vasculitis.

The pathogenesis of anti-neutrophil cytoplasmic antibody (ANCA)-associated vasculitides is complex; however, a better understanding in recent years has enabled new therapeutic approaches. In recent years priority was given to the minimization of treatment-associated toxicity. For induction of remission of severe granulomatosis with polyangiitis (GPA) and microscopic polyangiitis (MPA), glucocorticoids are used as well as cyclophosphamide and rituximab. The current recommendations enable a more rapid tapering of steroid dose and advise caution in the use of plasmapheresis. Rituximab and azathioprine are available options for maintenance of remission. The choice of medication and duration of remission maintenance are oriented particularly to the risk of recurrence. The importance of low-dose steroids has not yet been finally clarified. New treatment approaches, such as the C5a receptor inhibitor avacopan could enable a minimized steroid treatment in the future. The treatment of eosinophilic granulomatosis with polyangiitis (EGPA) is less evidence-based and consists of glucocorticoids, immunosuppressive agents depending on the severity and increasingly more biologics, e.g. interleukin‑5 blockade. Supportive measures (e.g. vaccinations, infection prophylaxis, cardiovascular risk management) are increasing in importance. Future treatment strategies must take the individual risk (e.g. ANCA subtype, relapse risk) more into consideration for selection and duration of treatment.

The antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibody (ANCA) vasculitides include several closely related, often severe, multisystem autoimmune diseases characterized by antibodies against serine proteinase 3 (PR3) or myeloperoxidase. Loss of tolerance to these antigens triggers a cascade of events, beginning with the priming of neutrophils by proinflammatory cytokines and complement activation, translocation of ANCA-specific antigens to the plasma membrane, neutrophil hyperactivation, and further activation of the alternative complement pathway, leading to tissue damage and the clinical manifestations of ANCA vasculitis. Due to the heterogeneity in presentation of these diseases, diagnosis is often substantially delayed, leading to poor outcomes. The current treatment pathway for most patients involves induction with cyclophosphamide or rituximab in combination with glucocorticoids, followed by a maintenance phase with rituximab, azathioprine, or methotrexate, during which time glucocorticoids are tapered. Current therapies are often effective in inducing and maintaining remission but are associated with a range of toxicities. Several new therapies are in development for ANCA vasculitis. Avacopan, an orally administered inhibitor of the complement fragment 5a (C5a) receptor, has been assessed in a phase 3 clinical trial and may play a role in reducing the cumulative glucocorticoid dose. Preliminary data suggest that cluster of differentiation (CD) 80 and CD86 blockade with abatacept may also have a role in the management of ANCA vasculitis. There is an unmet need for additional therapeutic options for patients with these diseases.

Avacopan (TAVNEOS™) is a complement 5a receptor (C5aR) antagonist developed by ChemoCentryx for the treatment of autoimmune diseases including anti-neutrophil cytoplasmic autoantibody (ANCA)-associated vasculitis. The therapeutic effects of avacopan are attributed to the inhibition of C5aR activity on neutrophils, however, the exact mechanism of therapeutic efficacy in patients with ANCA-associated vasculitis has not been established. In September 2021, avacopan received its first approval in Japan for the treatment of microscopic polyangiitis (MPA) and granulomatosis with polyangiitis (GPA), the two most common forms of ANCA-associated vasculitis, where it is being commercialized by Kissei Pharmaceutical through a partnership with Vifor Pharma. In October 2021, avacopan was approved in the USA as an adjunctive treatment in adults for severe active ANCA-associated vasculitis (specifically MPA and GPA) in combination with standard therapy including glucocorticoids (avacopan does not eliminate glucocorticoid use). Avacopan has received a positive opinion in the EU, and is also undergoing regulatory review in Switzerland and Canada. Avacopan is being investigated for the treatment of complement component 3 glomerulopathy, hidradenitis suppurativa, lupus nephritis and IgA nephropathy. This article summarizes the milestones in the development of avacopan leading to these first approvals in Japan and the USA.

<b>Introduction</b>: Anti-neutrophil cytoplasm autoantibodies (ANCA)-associated vasculitides (AAVs) are a group of rare heterogeneous diseases characterized by blood vessel inflammation resulting in organ destruction and death. Although various treatment strategies have resulted in marked improvement in vasculitis-specific outcomes, many patients with AAV continue to suffer from complications related to the prolonged use of glucocorticoids (GC) such as infections, metabolic abnormalities, and increased cardiovascular morbidity. Recently, activation of the alternative complement pathway has been implicated in the augmentation of the damage caused by AAV via the complement C5a receptor (C5aR1, CD88). Specifically targeting this pathway may lead to improved outcomes in patients with AAV.<b>Areas covered</b>: In this article, we have summarized the rationale for targeting the complement pathway in AAV. The relevant pre-clinical, phase I, II and III findings with emphasis on the efficacy, and safety of avacopan, a new oral competitive inhibitor that interferes with the binding of C5a to C5aR1 (CD88), are reviewed.<b>Expert opinion</b>: These results are encouraging, may led to major changes in the treatment approach for AAV, and give rise to future studies utilizing complement inhibitors in AAV patients, and potentially in other immune mediated diseases.

Vasculitides can affect small, medium and/or large vessels, leading to end-organ damage, decreased quality of life and death. Glucocorticoids remain the backbone of treatment for systemic vasculitis but are associated with numerous toxicities. In recent years, the efficacy of glucocorticoid-sparing biologic and novel small molecule therapies has been demonstrated. In giant cell arteritis, tocilizumab was superior to glucocorticoid monotherapy in maintenance remission and cumulative glucocorticoid exposure and is now approved for the treatment of giant cell arteritis. In addition to the previously demonstrated efficacy of rituximab for remission induction in antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibody (ANCA)-associated vasculitis, recent trials have also demonstrated its superiority for remission maintenance compared to alternative approaches. Mepolizumab is superior to standard of care alone with regard to remission rates and glucocorticoid-sparing effect in refractory eosinophilic granulomatosis with polyangiitis. Avacopan has shown significant promise in ANCA-associated vasculitis as part of a glucocorticoid-free induction regimen in a recently completed phase 3 trial. Use of biologics in rarer vasculitides remains guided by reports from small case series. Biologics and other novel therapies have an increasingly important role in the management of systemic vasculitis. Additional studies are needed to define their optimal use and to guide their use in more rare forms of vasculitis.

The C5a receptor inhibitor avacopan is being studied for the treatment of antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibody (ANCA)-associated vasculitis. In this randomized, controlled trial, we assigned patients with ANCA-associated vasculitis in a 1:1 ratio to receive oral avacopan at a dose of 30 mg twice daily or oral prednisone on a tapering schedule. All the patients received either cyclophosphamide (followed by azathioprine) or rituximab. The first primary end point was remission, defined as a Birmingham Vasculitis Activity Score (BVAS) of 0 (on a scale from 0 to 63, with higher scores indicating greater disease activity) at week 26 and no glucocorticoid use in the previous 4 weeks. The second primary end point was sustained remission, defined as remission at both weeks 26 and 52. Both end points were tested for noninferiority (by a margin of 20 percentage points) and for superiority. A total of 331 patients underwent randomization; 166 were assigned to receive avacopan, and 165 were assigned to receive prednisone. The mean BVAS at baseline was 16 in both groups. Remission at week 26 (the first primary end point) was observed in 120 of 166 patients (72.3%) receiving avacopan and in 115 of 164 patients (70.1%) receiving prednisone (estimated common difference, 3.4 percentage points; 95% confidence interval [CI], -6.0 to 12.8; P<0.001 for noninferiority; P = 0.24 for superiority). Sustained remission at week 52 (the second primary end point) was observed in 109 of 166 patients (65.7%) receiving avacopan and in 90 of 164 patients (54.9%) receiving prednisone (estimated common difference, 12.5 percentage points; 95% CI, 2.6 to 22.3; P<0.001 for noninferiority; P = 0.007 for superiority). Serious adverse events (excluding worsening vasculitis) occurred in 37.3% of the patients receiving avacopan and in 39.0% of those receiving prednisone. In this trial involving patients with ANCA-associated vasculitis, avacopan was noninferior but not superior to prednisone taper with respect to remission at week 26 and was superior to prednisone taper with respect to sustained remission at week 52. All the patients received cyclophosphamide or rituximab. The safety and clinical effects of avacopan beyond 52 weeks were not addressed in the trial.

ANCA-associated vasculitis (AAV) is a rare but potentially life-threatening disease. Currently used induction treatment (cyclophosphamide or rituximab with high-dose corticosteroids) has significantly improved outcome of AAV, but is associated with high toxicity. Alternative complement pathway activation was shown to play a role in the pathogenesis of AAV, thus providing rationale for the use of avacopan, a selective inhibitor of C5a receptor, in the treatment of AAV. Areas covered: Pharmacokinetic and pharmocodynamic properties of avacopan, clinical efficacy and safety and tolerability of avacopan in so far performed clinical trials in patients with AAV are reviewed and discussed. Expert opinion: Avacopan was shown to have at least similar efficacy compared to high dose corticosteroids in patients with active AAV with renal involvement, while there were no major safety issues reported. Replacement of corticosteroids should decrease the corticosteroid-related toxicity and improve long-term outcome of patients with AAV even though this still needs to be confirmed in a larger trial. Data on long-term outcome of avacopan-treated patients are currently lacking and will be eagerly awaited. In the future, avacopan could replace corticosteroids not only in the induction phase, but also in the maintenance treatment of AAV.

As demonstrated in the ADVOCATE-trial avacopan allows for a substantial reduction of glucocorticoid (GC) use during induction of remission. A future role of avacopan in the treatment of GPA and MPA is likely. Likewise, the PEXIVAS-trial showed that GC reduction of up to 60 % compared to standard dose was equal effective. The same trial proved no benefit of plasma exchange in addition to standard induction of remission. Plasma exchange therefore is now mostly obsolete. Rituximab is well established as maintenance therapy in AAV. The optimal duration however is still unknown. The MAINRITSAN 3 study indicates that prolonged use of more than 2 years is beneficial. EGPA:  In line with earlier clinical evidence a GWAS including 534 EGPA patients indicated at last 2 distinct subgroups. The conception of a predominantly "vasculitis" and a more "eosinophilic" phenotype is supported by this genetic evidence and most likely will lead to more differentiated therapies. With the IL5-antibody mepolizumab a first principle targeting the eosinophilic component of EGPA is now available and proved to be clinically beneficial.

This study aimed to evaluate the safety of avacopan, an orally administered C5a receptor inhibitor, for the treatment of antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibody (ANCA)-associated vasculitis in addition to standard-of-care (SOC) treatment with glucocorticoids with cyclophosphamide or rituximab. In this randomized 12-week study, twice daily avacopan (10 mg or 30 mg) plus SOC was assessed versus SOC only in patients with newly diagnosed/relapsing ANCA-associated vasculitis. Efficacy measurements included 50% or greater reduction in Birmingham Vasculitis Activity Score (BVAS) at day 85, rapid reduction (day 29) of BVAS to a score of 0 that was sustained through day 85, change in Vasculitis Damage Index (VDI), renal response (improvement in estimated glomerular filtration rate [eGFR], hematuria, and albuminuria), and health-related quality of life (HRQoL). Forty-two patients were randomized (n = 13 SOC, n = 13 avacopan 10 mg, and n = 16 avacopan 30 mg). Serious adverse events occurred in 15% and 17% of patients receiving SOC only and patients receiving avacopan with SOC, respectively. In the intent-to-treat population, BVAS response was high across arms (11 of 13 SOC, 11 of 12 avacopan 10 mg, and 12 of 15 avacopan 30 mg); increases in mean VDI were greater with SOC only than with avacopan plus SOC (0.3 versus 0.1). Avacopan 30 mg was numerically superior to placebo and avacopan 10 mg in early remission (15%, 8%, and 20% for SOC only, avacopan 10 mg, and avacopan 30 mg, respectively), improved eGFR (+2.0 ml/min/1.73m<sup>2</sup> , +1.3 ml/min/1.73m<sup>2</sup> , and +6.2 ml/min/1.73m<sup>2</sup> , respectively), renal response (17%, 40%, and 63%, respectively), and measures of HRQoL. Avacopan in addition to SOC for ANCA-associated vasculitis was well tolerated, and at the higher study dose, it appeared to improve time to remission (ClinicalTrials.gov identifier NCT02222155).

Antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibody (ANCA)-associated vasculitis is a serious, often life-threatening disease. In new-onset disease or a relapse, the standard treatment is immunosuppressive therapy with glucocorticoids; these therapies are associated with substantial short- and long-term toxicity. Complement component 5a (C5a) binding to C5a receptor (C5aR) may play a central role in the pathogenesis of ANCA-associated vasculitis. Avacopan is a novel, orally bioavailable, and highly selective antagonist of human C5aR. Avacopan does not interfere with the production of C5b or the membrane attack complex (ie, terminal complement complex) and does not block C5a binding to a second receptor, C5L2 (also called C5aR2), shown to be protective in antimyeloperoxidase glomerulonephritis. This trial will evaluate if avacopan replaces the need for chronic glucocorticoids in the treatment of ANCA-associated vasculitis. The aim of this study is to determine the proportions of patients in remission at week 26 and with sustained remission at week 52, defined as Birmingham Vasculitis Activity Score=0, and not taking glucocorticoids within the 4 weeks before week 26 and week 52, respectively. The Avacopan Development in Vasculitis to Obtain Corticosteroid elimination and Therapeutic Efficacy study is a randomized, double-blind, active-comparator (prednisone), 2-arm study evaluating the safety and efficacy of avacopan versus prednisone, administered in combination with other immunosuppressive therapy. Eligible subjects will have active disease requiring induction of remission. Subjects are stratified based on the type of immunosuppressive therapy, ANCA subtype, and new or relapsing disease. Target sample size is 300 patients, enrolled at over 200 sites globally. All authors and local ethics committees approved the study design. All patients will provide informed consent. Enrollment of patients was completed in Q4 2018. Topline results are anticipated to be published by Q3 2020. Results will be released irrespective of whether the findings are positive or negative.
