What is the Pfam database?

[PMID: 19614588]
Protein domains are the common currency of protein structure and function. Over 10,000 such protein families have now been collected in the Pfam database. Using these data along with animal gene phylogenies from TreeFam allowed us to investigate the gain and loss of protein domains. Most gains and losses of domains occur at protein termini. We show that the nature of changes is similar after speciation or duplication events. However, changes in domain architecture happen at a higher frequency after gene duplication. We suggest that the bias towards protein termini is largely because insertion and deletion of domains at most positions in a protein are likely to disrupt the structure of existing domains. We can also use Pfam to trace the evolution of specific families. For example, the immunoglobulin superfamily can be traced over 500 million years during its expansion into one of the largest families in the human genome. It can be shown that this protein family has its origins in basic animals such as the poriferan sponges where it is found in cell-surface-receptor proteins. We can trace how the structure and sequence of this family diverged during vertebrate evolution into constant and variable domains that are found in the antibodies of our immune system as well as in neural and muscle proteins.

Pseudofam (http://pseudofam.pseudogene.org) is a database of pseudogene families based on the protein families from the Pfam database. It provides resources for analyzing the family structure of pseudogenes including query tools, statistical summaries and sequence alignments. The current version of Pseudofam contains more than 125,000 pseudogenes identified from 10 eukaryotic genomes and aligned within nearly 3000 families (approximately one-third of the total families in PfamA). Pseudofam uses a large-scale parallelized homology search algorithm (implemented as an extension of the PseudoPipe pipeline) to identify pseudogenes. Each identified pseudogene is assigned to its parent protein family and subsequently aligned to each other by transferring the parent domain alignments from the Pfam family. Pseudogenes are also given additional annotation based on an ontology, reflecting their mode of creation and subsequent history. In particular, our annotation highlights the association of pseudogene families with genomic features, such as segmental duplications. In addition, pseudogene families are associated with key statistics, which identify outlier families with an unusual degree of pseudogenization. The statistics also show how the number of genes and pseudogenes in families correlates across different species. Overall, they highlight the fact that housekeeping families tend to be enriched with a large number of pseudogenes.

It is a worthy goal to completely characterize all human proteins in terms of their domains. Here, using the Pfam database, we asked how far we have progressed in this endeavour. Ninety per cent of proteins in the human proteome matched at least one of 5494 manually curated Pfam-A families. In contrast, human residue coverage by Pfam-A families was <45%, with 9418 automatically generated Pfam-B families adding a further 10%. Even after excluding predicted signal peptide regions and short regions (<50 consecutive residues) unlikely to harbour new families, for âˆ¼38% of the human protein residues, there was no information in Pfam about conservation and evolutionary relationship with other protein regions. This uncovered portion of the human proteome was found to be distributed over almost 25 000 distinct protein regions. Comparison with proteins in the UniProtKB database suggested that the human regions that exhibited similarity to thousands of other sequences were often either divergent elements or N- or C-terminal extensions of existing families. Thirty-four per cent of regions, on the other hand, matched fewer than 100 sequences in UniProtKB. Most of these did not appear to share any relationship with existing Pfam-A families, suggesting that thousands of new families would need to be generated to cover them. Also, these latter regions were particularly rich in amino acid compositional bias such as the one associated with intrinsic disorder. This could represent a significant obstacle toward their inclusion into new Pfam families. Based on these observations, a major focus for increasing Pfam coverage of the human proteome will be to improve the definition of existing families. New families will also be built, prioritizing those that have been experimentally functionally characterized. Database URL: http://pfam.sanger.ac.uk/

The Pfam database is an important tool in genome annotation, since it provides a collection of curated protein families. However, a subset of these families, known as domains of unknown function (DUFs), remains poorly characterized. We have related sequences from DUF404, DUF407, DUF482, DUF608, DUF810, DUF853, DUF976 and DUF1111 to homologs in PDB, within the midnight zone (9-20%) of sequence identity. These relationships were extended to provide functional annotation by sequence analysis and model building. Also described are examples of residue plasticity within enzyme active sites, and change of function within homologous sequences of a DUF.

Domains of unknown function (DUFs) are a large set of uncharacterized protein families that are found in the Pfam database. Here, the scale and growth of functionally uncharacterized families in biological databases are surveyed and the prospects for discovering their function are examined. In particular, the important role that structural genomics can play in identifying potential function is evaluated.

The database iPfam, available at http://ipfam.org, catalogues Pfam domain interactions based on known 3D structures that are found in the Protein Data Bank, providing interaction data at the molecular level. Previously, the iPfam domain-domain interaction data was integrated within the Pfam database and website, but it has now been migrated to a separate database. This allows for independent development, improving data access and giving clearer separation between the protein family and interactions datasets. In addition to domain-domain interactions, iPfam has been expanded to include interaction data for domain bound small molecule ligands. Functional annotations are provided from source databases, supplemented by the incorporation of Wikipedia articles where available. iPfam (version 1.0) contains >9500 domain-domain and 15 500 domain-ligand interactions. The new website provides access to this data in a variety of ways, including interactive visualizations of the interaction data.
