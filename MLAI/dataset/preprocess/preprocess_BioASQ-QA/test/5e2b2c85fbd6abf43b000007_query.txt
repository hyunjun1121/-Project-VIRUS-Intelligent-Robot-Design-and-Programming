The aim of this study was to compare quality of life (QOL) in small unilateral vestibular schwannoma (VS) patients managed by microsurgery, radiotherapy or observation. A retrospective chart review. The study included a total of 142 patients with VS stage 1 or 2 according to the Koos classification and treated between January 2004 and December 2015. Microsurgery, radiotherapy and observation groups comprised 43, 46 and 53 patients, respectively. All patients completed four QOL (questionnaires: Short-Form Health Survey 36, Hearing Handicap Inventory, Tinnitus Handicap Inventory and Dizziness Handicap Inventory Short-Form). Clinical symptoms and QOL were compared among groups. The average time interval between management and filling in the questionnaires was 66 months. There was no difference in QOL between the three groups on any of the four questionnaires. The most debilitating symptom was vertigo for all three groups. Tinnitus was a pejorative factor in the surgery group. Hearing level was deteriorated after microsurgery but there was no significant difference between the radiotherapy group and the middle fossa approach. Patients with small VS stage 1 and 2 had similar QOL, irrespective of management by observation, radiotherapy or microsurgery. The overall predictor for long-term reduced QOL was vertigo. Vestibular rehabilitation could improve QOL in symptomatic patients.

To determine whether cervical vestibular evoked myogenic potentials (cVEMPs) are predictive of hearing preservation in patients undergoing vestibular schwannoma removal through middle fossa craniotomy approach. Retrospective case study. Tertiary referral center. Eighteen patients who underwent a middle fossa craniotomy for vestibular schwannoma (stage I or II of Koos classification) with attempted hearing preservation from January 2008 to February 2016 were retrospectively reviewed. Pre-surgical cVEMPs test, videonystagmography (caloric test), and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) as well as a pre- and post-surgical audiometry test. cVEMPs parameters including amplitude asymmetry ratio (AR), P13, and N23 latencies and peak-to-peak amplitude between P13 and N23 waves were calculated. Hearing data were classified according to the AAO-HNS hearing classes. The nerve of origin of the tumor was specified during surgery and the largest tumor diameter was measure on MRI axial plane on T2-CISS weighed images. Preoperative amplitude asymmetry ratio was lower (n = 15, Mann-Whitney U test, p < 0.001) in the group with postoperative hearing preservation (n = 11) compared with the group with postoperative hearing preservation failure (n = 4). The positive predictive value of an AR less than 24% to assess postoperative hearing preservation is 91.6%. Tumor size and localization were not correlated with cVEMPs, nor with caloric testing in this group of small-sized intracanalicular vestibular schwannomas. Our data suggest that cVEMPs may help predict hearing preservation outcome in vestibular schwannoma surgery via the middle fossa craniotomy approach.

The Koos classification of vestibular schwannomas is designed to stratify tumors based on extrameatal extension and compression of the brainstem. While this classification system is widely reported in the literature, to date no study has assessed its reliability. To assess the intra- and inter-rater reliability of the Koos classification system. After institutional review board approval was obtained, a cross-sectional group of the Magnetic Resonance imagings of 40 patients with vestibular schwannomas varying in size comprised the study sample. Four raters were selected to assign a Koos grade to 50 total scans. Inter- and intrarater reliability were calculated and reported using Fleiss' kappa, Kendall's W, and Intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC). Inter-rater reliability was found to be substantial when measured using Fleiss' kappa (.71), extremely strong using Kendall's W (.92), and excellent as calculated by ICC (.88).Intrarater reliability was perfect for 3 out of 4 raters as assessed using weighted kappa, Kendall's W and ICC, with the intrarater agreement for the fourth rater measured as extremely high. We have demonstrated that the Koos classification system for vestibular schwannoma is a reliable method for tumor classification. This study lends further support to the results of current literature using Koos grading system. Further studies are required to evaluate its validity and utility in counseling patients with regard to outcomes.

Grade IV vestibular schwannoma (Koos classification) is generally considered to be an indication for microsurgical resection or combined radiosurgery-microsurgery. However, the place of Gamma Knife stereotactic surgery (GK-SRS), either as first-line treatment or when progression of residual tumor compresses the brainstem, has not been clearly evaluated. This article reports the results of a large case series of patients with grade 4 vestibular schwannoma treated by GK-SRS. All consecutive patients with grade IV vestibular schwannoma treated by GK-SRS in our department between 1996 and 2011 with a minimum follow-up of 3 years were included in this study. 86 patients were treated by GK-SRS with a minimum follow-up of 3 years. Mean follow-up was 6.2 years (3-16 years). The mean age of the patients at the time of GK-SRS was 54.6 years (range: 23-84) and the sex ratio was 0.6. At the time of radiosurgery, no patient presented brainstem dysfunction prior to GK-SRS. 38 patients had functional hearing before treatment. One patient presented mild trigeminal neuralgia before GK-SRS. Tumor control with no clinical deterioration was obtained in 78 patients (90.7%). No radiation-induced brainstem or cranial nerve toxicity was observed in any of these patients. Functional hearing was maintained in 25 patients. 8 (9.3%) patients presented tumor growth and required microsurgical resection in 7 cases and ventricular shunt in 1 case. On the basis of this large series, GK-SRS appears to be a safe and effective treatment option for grade IV vestibular schwannoma for patients with no signs of brainstem dysfunction.
