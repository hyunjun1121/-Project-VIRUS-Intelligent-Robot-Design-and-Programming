What is the effect of the absence of Saccharomyces cerevisiae Rrm3p?

[PMID: 18725402]
Schizosaccharomyces pombe Pfh1p is an essential member of the Pif family of 5'-3' DNA helicases. The two Saccharomyces cerevisiae homologs, Pif1p and Rrm3p, function in nuclear DNA replication, telomere length regulation, and mitochondrial genome integrity. We demonstrate here the existence of multiple Pfh1p isoforms that localized to either nuclei or mitochondria. The catalytic activity of Pfh1p was essential in both cellular compartments. The absence of nuclear Pfh1p resulted in G(2) arrest and accumulation of DNA damage foci, a finding suggestive of an essential role in DNA replication. Exogenous DNA damage resulted in localization of Pfh1p to DNA damage foci, suggesting that nuclear Pfh1p also functions in DNA repair. The absence of mitochondrial Pfh1p caused rapid depletion of mitochondrial DNA. Despite localization to nuclei and mitochondria in S. pombe, neither of the S. cerevisiae homologs, nor human PIF1, suppressed the lethality of pfh1Delta cells. However, the essential nuclear function of Pfh1p could be supplied by Rrm3p. Expression of Rrm3p suppressed the accumulation of DNA damage foci but not the hydroxyurea sensitivity of cells depleted of nuclear Pfh1p. Together, these data demonstrate that Pfh1p has essential roles in the replication of both nuclear and mitochondrial DNA.

In wild-type Saccharomyces cerevisiae, replication forks slowed during their passage through telomeric C(1-3)A/TG(1-3) tracts. This slowing was greatly exacerbated in the absence of RRM3, shown here to encode a 5' to 3' DNA helicase. Rrm3p-dependent fork progression was seen at a modified Chromosome VII-L telomere, at the natural X-bearing Chromosome III-L telomere, and at Y'-bearing telomeres. Loss of Rrm3p also resulted in replication fork pausing at specific sites in subtelomeric DNA, such as at inactive replication origins, and at internal tracts of C(1-3)A/TG(1-3) DNA. The ATPase/helicase activity of Rrm3p was required for its role in telomeric and subtelomeric DNA replication. Because Rrm3p was telomere-associated in vivo, it likely has a direct role in telomere replication.

The Saccharomyces cerevisiae RRM3 gene encodes a 5' to 3' DNA helicase. While replication of most of the yeast genome was not dependent upon Rrm3p, in its absence, replication forks paused and often broke at an estimated 1400 discrete sites, including tRNA genes, centromeres, inactive replication origins, and transcriptional silencers. These replication defects were associated with activation of the intra-S phase checkpoint. Activation of the checkpoint was critical for viability of rrm3Delta cells, especially at low temperatures. Each site whose replication was affected by Rrm3p is assembled into a nonnucleosomal protein-DNA complex. At tRNA genes and the silent mating type loci, disruption of these complexes eliminated dependence upon Rrm3p. These data indicate that the Rrm3p DNA helicase helps replication forks traverse protein-DNA complexes, naturally occurring impediments that are encountered in each S phase.

How the cellular amount of mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) is regulated under normal conditions and in the presence of genotoxic stress is less understood. We demonstrate that the inefficient mtDNA replication process of mutant yeast cells lacking the PIF1 DNA helicase is partly rescued in the absence of the DNA helicase RRM3. The rescue effect is likely due to the increase in the deoxynucleoside triphosphates (dNTPs) pool caused by the lack of RRM3. In contrast, the Pif1p-dependent mtDNA breakage in the presence and absence of genotoxic stress is not suppressed if RRM3 is lacking suggesting that this phenotype is likely independent of the dNTP pool. Pif1 protein (Pif1p) was found to stimulate the incorporation of dNTPs into newly synthesised mtDNA of gradient-purified mitochondria. We propose that Pif1p that acts likely as a DNA helicase in mitochondria affects mtDNA replication directly. Possible roles of Pif1p include the resolution of secondary DNA and/or DNA/RNA structures, the temporarily displacement of tightly bound mtDNA-binding proteins, or the stabilization of the mitochondrial replication complex during mtDNA replication.

Termination of replication forks at the natural termini of the rDNA of Saccharomyces cerevisiae is controlled in a sequence-specific and polar mode by the interaction of the Fob1p replication terminator protein with the tandem Ter sites located in the nontranscribed spacers. Here we show, by both 2D gel analyses and chromatin immunoprecipitations (ChIP), that there exists a second level of global control mediated by the intra-S-phase checkpoint protein complex of Tof1p and Csm3p that protect stalled forks at Ter sites against the activity of the Rrm3p helicase ("sweepase"). The sweepase tends to release arrested forks presumably by the transient displacement of the Ter-bound Fob1p. Consistent with this mechanism, very few replication forks were arrested at the natural replication termini in the absence of the two checkpoint proteins. In the absence of the Rrm3p helicase, there was a slight enhancement of fork arrest at the Ter sites. Simultaneous deletions of the TOF1 (or CSM3), and the RRM3 genes restored fork arrest by removing both the fork-releasing and fork-protection activities. Other genes such as MRC1, WSS1, and PSY2 that are also involved in the MRC1 checkpoint pathway were not involved in this global control. This observation suggests that Tof1p-Csm3p function differently from MRC1 and the other above-mentioned genes. This mechanism is not restricted to the natural Ter sites but was also observed at fork arrest caused by the meeting of a replication fork with transcription approaching from the opposite direction.

Replication forks face multiple obstacles that slow their progression. By two-dimensional gel analysis, yeast forks pause at stable DNA protein complexes, and this pausing is greatly increased in the absence of the Rrm3 helicase. We used a genome-wide approach to identify 96 sites of very high DNA polymerase binding in wild-type cells. Most of these binding sites were not previously identified pause sites. Rather, the most highly represented genomic category among high DNA polymerase binding sites was the open reading frames (ORFs) of highly transcribed RNA polymerase II genes. Twice as many pause sites were identified in rrm3 compared with wild-type cells, as pausing in this strain occurred at both highly transcribed RNA polymerase II genes and the previously identified protein DNA complexes. ORFs of highly transcribed RNA polymerase II genes are a class of natural pause sites that are not exacerbated in rrm3 cells.

Lack of the yeast Rrm3p DNA helicase causes replication defects at multiple sites within ribosomal DNA (rDNA), including at the replication fork barrier (RFB). These defects were unaltered in rrm3 sir2 cells. When the RFB binding Fob1p was deleted, rrm3-generated defects at the RFB were eliminated, but defects at other rDNA sites were not affected. Thus, specific protein-DNA complexes make replication Rrm3p-dependent. Because rrm3-induced increases in recombination and cell cycle length were only partially suppressed in rrm3 fob1 cells, which still required checkpoint and fork restart activities for viability, non-RFB rrm3-induced defects contribute to rDNA fragility and genome instability.

The DNA helicase Rrm3 promotes replication fork progression through >1000 discrete genomic regions and represses the cDNA-mediated mobility of the Ty1 retrotransposon. We explored the connection between DNA replication and Ty1 retromobility by investigating the basis of increased retromobility in an rrm3 mutant. Even though Ty1 cDNA levels are increased in the absence of RRM3, neither the level nor target-site specificity of cDNA integration was altered. Instead, cDNA was incorporated into the genome by a Rad52-dependent mechanism that did not involve gene conversion of genomic Ty1 sequences. In rrm3 isolates, incorporated cDNA was often present in tandem arrays. Multimeric cDNA arrays probably arise during chromosomal break repair, since their appearance was strongly correlated with the formation of gross chromosomal rearrangements. Moreover, Ty1 multimers were invariantly located on rearranged chromosomes, when present. Overexpression of a cellular RNase H, which degrades RNA in an RNA:DNA hybrid, completely suppressed the increase in Ty1 multimer formation in an rrm3 mutant. We propose that RNA:DNA hybrid regions within nascent retrotransposition events block replication in an rrm3 mutant, leading to chromosome breaks within Ty1 sequences. Multiple extragenomic Ty1 cDNA molecules are then used as donors in recombinational repair of the break before it is healed.

The intra-S phase checkpoint protein complex Tof1/Csm3 of Saccharomyces cerevisiae antagonizes Rrm3 helicase to modulate replication fork arrest not only at the replication termini of rDNA but also at strong nonhistone protein binding sites throughout the genome. We investigated whether these checkpoint proteins acted either antagonistically or synergistically with Rrm3 in mediating other important functions such as maintenance of genome stability. High retromobility of a normally quiescent retrovirus-like transposable element Ty1 of S. cerevisiae is a form of genome instability, because the transposition events induce mutations. We measured the transposition of Ty1 in various genetic backgrounds and discovered that Tof1 suppressed excessive retromobility in collaboration with either Rrm3 or the F-box protein Dia2. Although both Rrm3 and Dia2 are believed to facilitate fork movement, fork stalling at DNA-protein complexes did not appear to be a major contributor to enhancement of retromobility. Absence of the aforementioned proteins either individually or in pair-wise combinations caused karyotype changes as revealed by the altered migrations of the individual chromosomes in pulsed field gels. The mobility changes were RNase H-resistant and therefore, unlikely to have been caused by extensive R loop formation. These mutations also resulted in alterations of telomere lengths. However, the latter changes could not fully account for the magnitude of the observed karyotypic alterations. We conclude that unlike other checkpoint proteins that are known to be required for elevated retromobility, Tof1 suppressed high frequency retrotransposition and maintained karyotype stability in collaboration with the aforementioned proteins.

Rrm3p is a 5'-to-3' DNA helicase that helps replication forks traverse protein-DNA complexes. Its absence leads to increased fork stalling and breakage at over 1,000 specific sites located throughout the Saccharomyces cerevisiae genome. To understand the mechanisms that respond to and repair rrm3-dependent lesions, we carried out a candidate gene deletion analysis to identify genes whose mutation conferred slow growth or lethality on rrm3 cells. Based on synthetic phenotypes, the intra-S-phase checkpoint, the SRS2 inhibitor of recombination, the SGS1/TOP3 replication fork restart pathway, and the MRE11/RAD50/XRS2 (MRX) complex were critical for viability of rrm3 cells. DNA damage checkpoint and homologous recombination genes were important for normal growth of rrm3 cells. However, the MUS81/MMS4 replication fork restart pathway did not affect growth of rrm3 cells. These data suggest a model in which the stalled and broken forks generated in rrm3 cells activate a checkpoint response that provides time for fork repair and restart. Stalled forks are converted by a Rad51p-mediated process to intermediates that are resolved by Sgs1p/Top3p. The rrm3 system provides a unique opportunity to learn the fate of forks whose progress is impaired by natural impediments rather than by exogenous DNA damage.
