Which olfactory gene senses androsterone?

Rat hydroxysteroid sulfotransferase (HS-SULT) cDNAs, ST-40 and ST-20 are 90% identical in amino acid sequences and show different substrate specificities toward dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA), androsterone (AD) and cortisol (CS). ST-40 enzyme is active toward the three substrates, whereas ST-20 enzyme is preferentially active for CS. First we prepared mutants of well conserved histidine, lysine and asparagine by site-directed mutagenesis. Secondly we constructed 20 chimeric HS-SULTs by reciprocal exchange of five protein domains between ST-20 and ST-40 enzymes. The studies on the expressed mutant and chimeric enzymes indicate the importance of the C-terminal region for the substrate specificity and the involvement of multiple regions for the enzyme activities. Next we determined the genetic loci of ST-40 and ST-20 by fluorescence in situ hybridization. Biotinylated ST-20 and ST-40 probes gave a pair of fluorescent spots on the same region of rat chromosome 1 and the loci of these genes were localized to the same chromosomal region of 1q21.3 --> q22.1. Finally we studied mouse olfactory phenol SULT (P-SULT). It was immunolocalized in the cytoplasm of mouse olfactory sustentacular cells and mouse nasal cytosols show high SULT activities toward phenolic aromatic odorants. We subsequently isolated a mouse P-SULT cDNA from mouse olfactory cDNA library. It encodes 304 amino acid polypeptide and is 94% identical with rat ST1C1 in amino acid sequences.

The scents of mammals are complex blends of natural products that reveal a wealth of individual information. Many mammals can decipher these scent codes to discern the gender, age, endocrine status, social status, and genotype of conspecifics using dedicated sensory receptors in their olfactory system. Among these social odors are pheromones, chemicals that trigger innate behaviors and physiological responses. Here, we review classes of mammal-derived natural products that influence behavior through activation of the olfactory system.

Specific anosmia is a term that describes an inability to perceive a particular odorant in the context of an otherwise normal olfactory acuity. The most common example, for the odor of androstenone, has been ascribed a prevalence ranging from 2 to 45%. In two experiments we sought to determine whether this wide range could be explained by the difference in steroid concentrations used, and by the degree to which the trigeminal system contributes to perception of androstenone. Experiment 1 demonstrated that high concentrations of androstenone stimulated the trigeminal system, as indicated by electrophysiological recordings. Experiment 2 demonstrated that conscious detection of androstenone is possible based solely on the trigeminal system. Interestingly, detection seems to interact with olfactory acuity in that subjects with a low olfactory sensitivity to androstenone were better able to detect its trigeminal component. The agreement between conscious experience and behavioral discrimination was not well calibrated, in that subjects demonstrated a clear overconfidence in their abilities. Altogether, the current study suggests that androstenone is an odorant that produces a concentration-dependent degree of trigeminal stimulation. This trigeminal component explains the diversity of the reported prevalence of specific anosmia for androstenone and might have implications on future use of specific anosmia as a tool to understand odor processing.

We explored genetic influences on the perception of taste and smell stimuli. Adult twins rated the chemosensory aspects of water, sucrose, sodium chloride, citric acid, ethanol, quinine hydrochloride, phenylthiocarbamide (PTC), potassium chloride, calcium chloride, cinnamon, androstenone, Galaxolide™, cilantro, and basil. For most traits, individual differences were stable over time and some traits were heritable (h(2) from 0.41 to 0.71). Subjects were genotyped for 44 single nucleotide polymorphisms within and near genes related to taste and smell. The results of these association analyses confirmed previous genotype-phenotype results for PTC, quinine, and androstenone. New associations were detected for ratings of basil and a bitter taste receptor gene, TAS2R60, and between cilantro and variants in three genes (TRPA1, GNAT3, and TAS2R50). The flavor of ethanol was related to variation within an olfactory receptor gene (OR7D4) and a gene encoding a subunit of the epithelial sodium channel (SCNN1D). Our study demonstrates that person-to-person differences in the taste and smell perception of simple foods and drinks are partially accounted for by genetic variation within chemosensory pathways.

Twin pairs and their siblings rated the intensity of the odorants amyl acetate, androstenone, eugenol, Galaxolide, mercaptans, and rose (N = 1573). Heritability was established for ratings of androstenone (h (2) = 0.30) and Galaxolide (h(2) = 0.34) but not for the other odorants. Genome-wide association analysis using 2.3 million single nucleotide polymorphisms indicated that the most significant association was between androstenone and a region without known olfactory receptor genes (rs10966900, P = 1.2 × 10(-7)). A previously reported association between the olfactory receptor OR7D4 and the androstenone was not detected until we specifically typed this gene (P = 1.1 × 10(-4)). We also tested these 2 associations in a second independent sample of subjects and replicated the results either fully (OR7D4, P = 0.00002) or partially (rs10966900, P = 0.010; N = 266). These findings suggest that 1) the perceived intensity of some but not all odorants is a heritable trait, 2) use of a current genome-wide marker panel did not detect a known olfactory genotype-phenotype association, and 3) person-to-person differences in androstenone perception are influenced by OR7D4 genotype and perhaps by variants of other genes.
