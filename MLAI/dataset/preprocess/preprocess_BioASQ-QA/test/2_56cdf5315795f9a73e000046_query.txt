Which is the enzyme that degrades decapped mRNAs?

[PMID: 24510189]
The removal of the 5'-cap structure by the decapping enzyme DCP2 and its coactivator DCP1 shuts down translation and exposes the mRNA to 5'-to-3' exonucleolytic degradation by XRN1. Although yeast DCP1 and DCP2 directly interact, an additional factor, EDC4, promotes DCP1-DCP2 association in metazoan. Here, we elucidate how the human proteins interact to assemble an active decapping complex and how decapped mRNAs are handed over to XRN1. We show that EDC4 serves as a scaffold for complex assembly, providing binding sites for DCP1, DCP2 and XRN1. DCP2 and XRN1 bind simultaneously to the EDC4 C-terminal domain through short linear motifs (SLiMs). Additionally, DCP1 and DCP2 form direct but weak interactions that are facilitated by EDC4. Mutational and functional studies indicate that the docking of DCP1 and DCP2 on the EDC4 scaffold is a critical step for mRNA decapping in vivo. They also revealed a crucial role for a conserved asparagine-arginine containing loop (the NR-loop) in the DCP1 EVH1 domain in DCP2 activation. Our data indicate that DCP2 activation by DCP1 occurs preferentially on the EDC4 scaffold, which may serve to couple DCP2 activation by DCP1 with 5'-to-3' mRNA degradation by XRN1 in human cells.

XRN1 is a 5' → 3' processive exoribonuclease that degrades mRNAs after they have been decapped. It is highly conserved in all eukaryotes, including homologs in Drosophila melanogaster (Pacman), Caenorhabditis elegans (XRN1), and Saccharomyces cerevisiae (Xrn1p). As well as being a key enzyme in RNA turnover, XRN1 is involved in nonsense-mediated mRNA decay and degradation of mRNAs after they have been targeted by small interfering RNAs or microRNAs. The crystal structure of XRN1 can explain its processivity and also the selectivity of the enzyme for 5' monophosphorylated RNA. In eukaryotic cells, XRN1 is often found in particles known as processing bodies (P bodies) together with other proteins involved in the 5' → 3' degradation pathway, such as DCP2 and the helicase DHH1 (Me31B). Although XRN1 shows little specificity to particular 5' monophosphorylated RNAs in vitro, mutations in XRN1 in vivo have specific phenotypes suggesting that it specifically degrades a subset of RNAs. In Drosophila, mutations in the gene encoding the XRN1 homolog pacman result in defects in wound healing, epithelial closure and stem cell renewal in testes. We propose a model where specific mRNAs are targeted to XRN1 via specific binding of miRNAs and/or RNA-binding proteins to instability elements within the RNA. These guide the RNA to the 5' core degradation apparatus for controlled degradation.
