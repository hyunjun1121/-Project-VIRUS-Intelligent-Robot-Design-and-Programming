Which disease can be prevented with PfSPZ Vaccine?

[PMID: 32920641]
A live-attenuated Plasmodium falciparum sporozoite (SPZ) vaccine (PfSPZ Vaccine) has shown up to 100% protection against controlled human malaria infection (CHMI) using homologous parasites (same P. falciparum strain as in the vaccine). Using a more stringent CHMI, with heterologous parasites (different P. falciparum strain), we assessed the impact of higher PfSPZ doses, a novel multi-dose prime regimen, and a delayed vaccine boost upon vaccine efficacy (VE). We immunized 4 groups that each contained 15 healthy, malaria-naive adults. Group 1 received 5 doses of 4.5 x 105 PfSPZ (Days 1, 3, 5, and 7; Week 16). Groups 2, 3, and 4 received 3 doses (Weeks 0, 8, and 16), with Group 2 receiving 9.0 × 105/doses; Group 3 receiving 18.0 × 105/doses; and Group 4 receiving 27.0 × 105 for dose 1 and 9.0 × 105 for doses 2 and 3. VE was assessed by heterologous CHMI after 12 or 24 weeks. Volunteers not protected at 12 weeks were boosted prior to repeat CHMI at 24 weeks. At 12-week CHMI, 6/15 (40%) participants in Group 1 (P = .04) and 3/15 (20%) participants in Group 2 remained aparasitemic, as compared to 0/8 controls. At 24-week CHMI, 3/13 (23%) participants in Group 3 and 3/14 (21%) participants in Group 4 remained aparasitemic, versus 0/8 controls (Groups 2-4, VE not significant). Postboost, 9/14 (64%) participants versus 0/8 controls remained aparasitemic (3/6 in Group 1, P = .025; 6/8 in Group 2, P = .002). Administering 4 stacked priming injections (multi-dose priming) resulted in 40% VE against heterologous CHMI, while dose escalation of PfSPZ using single-dose priming was not significantly protective. Boosting unprotected subjects improved VE at 24 weeks, to 64%. NCT02601716.

Plasmodium falciparum sporozite (PfSPZ) Vaccine is a metabolically active, non-replicating, whole malaria sporozoite vaccine that has been reported to be safe and protective against P falciparum controlled human malaria infection in malaria-naive individuals. We aimed to assess the safety and protective efficacy of PfSPZ Vaccine against naturally acquired P falciparum in malaria-experienced adults in Mali. After an open-label dose-escalation study in a pilot safety cohort, we did a double-blind, randomised, placebo-controlled trial based in Donéguébougou and surrounding villages in Mali. We recruited 18-35-year-old healthy adults who were randomly assigned (1:1) in a double-blind manner, with stratification by village and block randomisation, to receive either five doses of 2·7 × 10<sup>5</sup> PfSPZ or normal saline at days 0, 28, 56, 84, and 140 during the dry season (January to July inclusive). Participants and investigators were masked to group assignments, which were unmasked at the final study visit, 6 months after receipt of the last vaccination. Participants received combined artemether and lumefantrine (four tablets, each containing 20 mg artemether and 120 mg lumefantrine, given twice per day over 3 days for a total of six doses) to eliminate P falciparum before the first and last vaccinations. We collected blood smears every 2 weeks and during any illness for 24 weeks after the fifth vaccination. The primary outcome was the safety and tolerability of the vaccine, assessed as local and systemic reactogenicity and adverse events. The sample size was calculated for the exploratory efficacy endpoint of time to first P falciparum infection beginning 28 days after the fifth vaccination. The safety analysis included all participants who received at least one dose of investigational product, whereas the efficacy analyses included only participants who received all five vaccinations. This trial is registered at ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT01988636. Between Jan 18 and Feb 24, 2014, we enrolled 93 participants into the main study cohort with 46 participants assigned PfSPZ Vaccine and 47 assigned placebo, all of whom were evaluable for safety. We detected no significant differences in local or systemic adverse events or laboratory abnormalities between the PfSPZ Vaccine and placebo groups, and only grade 1 (mild) local or systemic adverse events occurred in both groups. The most common solicited systemic adverse event in the vaccine and placebo groups was headache (three [7%] people in the vaccine group vs four [9%] in the placebo group) followed by fatigue (one [2%] person in the placebo group), fever (one [2%] person in the placebo group), and myalgia (one [2%] person in each group). The exploratory efficacy analysis included 41 participants from the vaccine group and 40 from the placebo group. Of these participants, 37 (93%) from the placebo group and 27 (66%) from the vaccine group developed P falciparum infection. The hazard ratio for vaccine efficacy was 0·517 (95% CI 0·313-0·856) by time-to-infection analysis (log-rank p=0·01), and 0·712 (0·528-0·918) by proportional analysis (p=0·006). PfSPZ Vaccine was well tolerated and safe. PfSPZ Vaccine showed significant protection in African adults against P falciparum infection throughout an entire malaria season.

In 2013 there were an estimated 584,000 deaths and 198 million clinical illnesses due to malaria, the majority in sub-Saharan Africa. Vaccines would be the ideal addition to the existing armamentarium of anti-malaria tools. However, malaria is caused by parasites, and parasites are much more complex in terms of their biology than the viruses and bacteria for which we have vaccines, passing through multiple stages of development in the human host, each stage expressing hundreds of unique antigens. This complexity makes it more difficult to develop a vaccine for parasites than for viruses and bacteria, since an immune response targeting one stage may not offer protection against a later stage, because different antigens are the targets of protective immunity at different stages. Furthermore, depending on the life cycle stage and whether the parasite is extra- or intra-cellular, antibody and/or cellular immune responses provide protection. It is thus not surprising that there is no vaccine on the market for prevention of malaria, or any human parasitic infection. In fact, no vaccine for any disease with this breadth of targets and immune responses exists. In this limited review, we focus on four approaches to malaria vaccines, (1) a recombinant protein with adjuvant vaccine aimed at Plasmodium falciparum (Pf) pre-erythrocytic stages of the parasite cycle (RTS,S/AS01), (2) whole sporozoite vaccines aimed at Pf pre-erythrocytic stages (PfSPZ Vaccine and PfSPZ-CVac), (3) prime boost vaccines that include recombinant DNA, viruses and bacteria, and protein with adjuvant aimed primarily at Pf pre-erythrocytic, but also asexual erythrocytic stages, and (4) recombinant protein with adjuvant vaccines aimed at Pf and Plasmodium vivax sexual erythrocytic and mosquito stages. We recognize that we are not covering all approaches to malaria vaccine development, or most of the critically important work on development of vaccines against P. vivax, the second most important cause of malaria. Progress during the last few years has been significant, and a first generation malaria candidate vaccine, RTS,S/AS01, is under review by the European Medicines Agency (EMA) for its quality, safety and efficacy under article 58, which allows the EMA to give a scientific opinion about products intended exclusively for markets outside of the European Union. However, much work is in progress to optimize malaria vaccines in regard to magnitude and durability of protective efficacy and the financing and practicality of delivery. Thus, we are hopeful that anti-malaria vaccines will soon be important tools in the battle against malaria.

Immunization with Plasmodium falciparum (Pf) sporozoites under chemoprophylaxis (PfSPZ-CVac) is the most efficacious approach to malaria vaccination. Implementation is hampered by a complex chemoprophylaxis regimen and missing evidence for efficacy against heterologous infection. We report the results of a double-blinded, randomized, placebo-controlled trial of a simplified, condensed immunization regimen in malaria-naive volunteers (EudraCT-Nr: 2018-004523-36). Participants are immunized by direct venous inoculation of 1.1 × 10<sup>5</sup> aseptic, purified, cryopreserved PfSPZ (PfSPZ Challenge) of the PfNF54 strain or normal saline (placebo) on days 1, 6 and 29, with simultaneous oral administration of 10 mg/kg chloroquine base. Primary endpoints are vaccine efficacy tested by controlled human malaria infection (CHMI) using the highly divergent, heterologous strain Pf7G8 and safety. Twelve weeks following immunization, 10/13 participants in the vaccine group are sterilely protected against heterologous CHMI, while (5/5) participants receiving placebo develop parasitemia (risk difference: 77%, p = 0.004, Boschloo's test). Immunization is well tolerated with self-limiting grade 1-2 headaches, pyrexia and fatigue that diminish with each vaccination. Immunization induces 18-fold higher anti-Pf circumsporozoite protein (PfCSP) antibody levels in protected than in unprotected vaccinees (p = 0.028). In addition anti-PfMSP2 antibodies are strongly protection-associated by protein microarray assessment. This PfSPZ-CVac regimen is highly efficacious, simple, safe, well tolerated and highly immunogenic.

Malaria is a severe infectious disease with relatively high mortality, thus having been a scourge of humanity. There are a few candidate malaria vaccines that have shown a protective efficacy in humans against malaria. One of the candidate human malaria vaccines, which is based on human malaria sporozoites and called PfSPZ Vaccine, has been shown to protect a significant proportion of vaccine recipients from getting malaria. PfSPZ Vaccine elicits a potent response of hepatic CD8+ T cells that are specific for malaria antigens in non-human primates. To further characterize hepatic CD8+ T cells induced by the sporozoite-based malaria vaccine in a mouse model, we have used a cutting-edge Single-cell Barcode (SCBC) assay, a recently emerged approach/method for investigating the nature of T-cells responses during infection or cancer. Using the SCBC technology, we have identified a population of hepatic CD8+ T cells that are polyfunctional at a single cell level only in a group of vaccinated mice upon malaria challenge. The cytokines/chemokines secreted by these polyfunctional CD8+ T-cell subsets include MIP-1α, RANTES, IFN-γ, and/or IL-17A, which have shown to be associated with protective T-cell responses against certain pathogens. Therefore, a successful induction of such polyfunctional hepatic CD8+ T cells may be a key to the development of effective human malaria vaccine. In addition, the SCBC technology could provide a new level of diagnostic that will allow for a more accurate determination of vaccine efficacy.

The assessment of antibody responses after immunization with radiation-attenuated, aseptic, purified, cryopreserved Plasmodium falciparum sporozoites (Sanaria PfSPZ Vaccine) has focused on IgG isotype antibodies. Here, we aimed to investigate if P. falciparum sporozoite binding and invasion-inhibitory IgM antibodies are induced following immunization of malaria-preexposed volunteers with PfSPZ Vaccine. Using serum from volunteers immunized with PfSPZ, we measured vaccine-induced IgG and IgM antibodies to P. falciparum circumsporozoite protein (PfCSP) via ELISA. Function of this serum as well as IgM antibody fractions was measured via in vitro in an inhibition of sporozoite invasion assay. These IgM antibody fractions were also measured for binding to sporozoites by immunofluorescence assay and complement fixation on whole sporozoites. We found that in addition to anti-PfCSP IgG, malaria-preexposed volunteers developed anti-PfCSP IgM antibodies after immunization with PfSPZ Vaccine and that these IgM antibodies inhibited P. falciparum sporozoite invasion of hepatocytes in vitro. These IgM plasma fractions also fixed complement to whole P. falciparum sporozoites. This is the first finding that PfCSP and P. falciparum sporozoite-binding IgM antibodies are induced following immunization of PfSPZ Vaccine in malaria-preexposed individuals and that IgM antibodies can inhibit P. falciparum sporozoite invasion into hepatocytes in vitro and fix complement on sporozoites. These findings indicate that the immunological assessment of PfSPZ Vaccine-induced antibody responses could be more sensitive if they include parasite-specific IgM in addition to IgG antibodies.

A highly protective malaria vaccine would greatly facilitate the prevention and elimination of malaria and containment of drug-resistant parasites. A high level (more than 90%) of protection against malaria in humans has previously been achieved only by immunization with radiation-attenuated Plasmodium falciparum (Pf) sporozoites (PfSPZ) inoculated by mosquitoes; by intravenous injection of aseptic, purified, radiation-attenuated, cryopreserved PfSPZ ('PfSPZ Vaccine'); or by infectious PfSPZ inoculated by mosquitoes to volunteers taking chloroquine or mefloquine (chemoprophylaxis with sporozoites). We assessed immunization by direct venous inoculation of aseptic, purified, cryopreserved, non-irradiated PfSPZ ('PfSPZ Challenge') to malaria-naive, healthy adult volunteers taking chloroquine for antimalarial chemoprophylaxis (vaccine approach denoted as PfSPZ-CVac). Three doses of 5.12 × 10<sup>4</sup> PfSPZ of PfSPZ Challenge at 28-day intervals were well tolerated and safe, and prevented infection in 9 out of 9 (100%) volunteers who underwent controlled human malaria infection ten weeks after the last dose (group III). Protective efficacy was dependent on dose and regimen. Immunization with 3.2 × 10<sup>3</sup> (group I) or 1.28 × 10<sup>4</sup> (group II) PfSPZ protected 3 out of 9 (33%) or 6 out of 9 (67%) volunteers, respectively. Three doses of 5.12 × 10<sup>4</sup> PfSPZ at five-day intervals protected 5 out of 8 (63%) volunteers. The frequency of Pf-specific polyfunctional CD4 memory T cells was associated with protection. On a 7,455 peptide Pf proteome array, immune sera from at least 5 out of 9 group III vaccinees recognized each of 22 proteins. PfSPZ-CVac is a highly efficacious vaccine candidate; when we are able to optimize the immunization regimen (dose, interval between doses, and drug partner), this vaccine could be used for combination mass drug administration and a mass vaccination program approach to eliminate malaria from geographically defined areas.

<b>BACKGROUND</b>: A radiation-attenuated <i>Plasmodium falciparum</i> (Pf) sporozoite (SPZ) malaria vaccine, PfSPZ Vaccine, protected 6 of 6 subjects (100%) against homologous Pf (same strain as in the vaccine) controlled human malaria infection (CHMI) 3 weeks after 5 doses administered intravenously. The next step was to assess protective efficacy against heterologous Pf (different from Pf in the vaccine), after fewer doses, and at 24 weeks. <b>METHODS</b>: The trial assessed tolerability, safety, immunogenicity, and protective efficacy of direct venous inoculation (DVI) of 3 or 5 doses of PfSPZ Vaccine in non-immune subjects. <b>RESULTS</b>: Three weeks after final immunization, 5 doses of 2.7 × 10<sup>5</sup> PfSPZ protected 12 of 13 recipients (92.3% [95% CI: 48.0, 99.8]) against homologous CHMI and 4 of 5 (80.0% [10.4, 99.5]) against heterologous CHMI; 3 doses of 4.5 × 10<sup>5</sup> PfSPZ protected 13 of 15 (86.7% [35.9, 98.3]) against homologous CHMI. Twenty-four weeks after final immunization, the 5-dose regimen protected 7 of 10 (70.0% [17.3, 93.3]) against homologous and 1 of 10 (10.0% [-35.8, 45.6]) against heterologous CHMI; the 3-dose regimen protected 8 of 14 (57.1% [21.5, 76.6]) against homologous CHMI. All 22 controls developed Pf parasitemia. PfSPZ Vaccine was well tolerated, safe, and easy to administer. No antibody or T cell responses correlated with protection. <b>CONCLUSIONS</b>: We have demonstrated for the first time to our knowledge that PfSPZ Vaccine can protect against a 3-week heterologous CHMI in a limited group of malaria-naive adult subjects. A 3-dose regimen protected against both 3-week and 24-week homologous CHMI (87% and 57%, respectively) in this population. These results provide a foundation for developing an optimized immunization regimen for preventing malaria. <b>TRIAL REGISTRATION</b>: ClinicalTrials.gov NCT02215707. <b>FUNDING</b>: Support was provided through the US Army Medical Research and Development Command, Military Infectious Diseases Research Program, and the Naval Medical Research Center's Advanced Medical Development Program.

<i>Plasmodium falciparum</i> sporozoite (PfSPZ) Vaccine (radiation-attenuated, aseptic, purified, cryopreserved PfSPZ) and PfSPZ-CVac (infectious, aseptic, purified, cryopreserved PfSPZ administered to subjects taking weekly chloroquine chemoprophylaxis) have shown vaccine efficacies (VEs) of 100% against homologous controlled human malaria infection (CHMI) in nonimmune adults. <i>Plasmodium falciparum</i> sporozoite-CVac has never been assessed against CHMI in African vaccinees. We assessed the safety, immunogenicity, and VE against homologous CHMI of three doses of 2.7 × 10<sup>6</sup> PfSPZ of PfSPZ Vaccine at 8-week intervals and three doses of 1.0 × 10<sup>5</sup> PfSPZ of PfSPZ-CVac at 4-week intervals with each arm randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, and conducted in parallel. There were no differences in solicited adverse events between vaccinees and normal saline controls, or between PfSPZ Vaccine and PfSPZ-CVac recipients during the 6 days after administration of investigational product. However, from days 7-13, PfSPZ-CVac recipients had significantly more AEs, probably because of Pf parasitemia. Antibody responses were 2.9 times higher in PfSPZ Vaccine recipients than PfSPZ-CVac recipients at time of CHMI. Vaccine efficacy at a median of 14 weeks after last PfSPZ-CVac dose was 55% (8 of 13, <i>P</i> = 0.051) and at a median of 15 weeks after last PfSPZ Vaccine dose was 27% (5 of 15, <i>P</i> = 0.32). The higher VE in PfSPZ-CVac recipients of 55% with a 27-fold lower dose was likely a result of later stage parasite maturation in the liver, leading to induction of cellular immunity against a greater quantity and broader array of antigens.

PfSPZ Vaccine, composed of radiation-attenuated, aseptic, purified, cryopreserved Plasmodium falciparum sporozoites, is administered by direct venous inoculation (DVI) for maximal efficacy against malaria. A critical issue for advancing vaccines that are administered intravenously is the ability to efficiently administer them across multiple age groups. As part of a pediatric safety, immunogenicity, and efficacy trial in western Kenya, we evaluated the feasibility and tolerability of DVI, including ease of venous access, injection time, and crying during the procedure across age groups. Part 1 was an age de-escalation, dose escalation trial in children aged 13 months-5 years and infants aged 5-12 months; part 2 was a vaccine efficacy trial including only infants, using the most skilled injectors from part 1. Injectors could use a vein viewer, if needed. A total of 1222 injections (target 0.5 mL) were initiated by DVI in 511 participants (36 were 5-9-year-olds, 65 were 13-59-month-olds, and 410 infants). The complete volume was injected in 1185/1222 (97.0%) vaccinations, 1083/1185 (91.4%) achieved with the first DVI. 474/511 (92.8%) participants received only complete injections, 27/511 (5.3%) received at least one partial injection (<0.5 mL), and in 10/511 (2.0%) venous access was not obtained. The rate of complete injections by single DVI for infants improved from 77.1% in part 1 to 92.8% in part 2. No crying occurred in 51/59 (86.4%) vaccinations in 5-9-year-olds, 25/86 (29.1%) vaccinations in 13-59-month-olds and 172/1067 (16.1%) vaccinations in infants. Mean administration time ranged from 2.6 to 4.6 minutes and was longer for younger age groups. These data show that vaccination by DVI was feasible and well tolerated in infants and children in this rural hospital in western Kenya, when performed by skilled injectors. We also report that shipping and storage in liquid nitrogen vapor phase was simple and efficient. (Clinicaltrials.gov NCT02687373).

Great progress has been made in the development of whole sporozoite vaccines including the manufacturing of cryopreserved Plasmodium falciparum sporozoites (PfSPZ) suitable for clinical application. Such whole sporozoites are being used for clinical studies of controlled human malaria infection (CHMI) as well as for evaluation of candidate vaccine approaches (both attenuated sporozoites and infectious sporozoites administered with chemoprophylaxis) and as reagents for immunology and cell biology assays. CHMI studies with whole sporozoites provide a great opportunity to better understand the intrinsic mechanisms of resistance to P. falciparum (e.g. due to sickle cell trait and other hemoglobinopathies) as well as host responses to an initial P. falciparum infection. High-level protective efficacy has been demonstrated in a small number of volunteers after intravenous (IV) inoculation of radiation-attenuated PfSPZ or in those who were exposed to live PfSPZ while on malaria chemoprophylaxis. These advances and data warrant further investigations of the immunological mechanism(s) whereby whole sporozoite inoculation elicits protective immunity in order to facilitate whole sporozoite vaccine development. The National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID) convened a workshop on Sept. 2-3, 2014 involving participation of international experts in the field of malaria vaccine development, and in basic and clinical immunology research. The workshop discussed the current understanding of host immune responses to whole malaria sporozoite inoculation, identified gaps in knowledge, resources to facilitate progress, and applicable new technologies and approaches to accelerate immunologic and vaccinologic studies and biomarker identification. This report summarizes the discussions and major conclusions from the workshop participants.

Whole parasite vaccines provide a unique opportunity for dissecting immune mechanisms and identify antigens that are targeted by immune responses which have the potential to mediate sterile protection against malaria infections. The radiation attenuated sporozoite (PfSPZ) vaccine has been considered the gold standard for malaria vaccines because of its unparalleled efficacy. The immunogenicity of this and other vaccines continues to be evaluated by using recombinant proteins or peptides of known sporozoite antigens. This approach, however, has significant limitations by relying solely on a limited number of known pathogen-associated immune epitopes. Using the full range of antigens expressed by the sporozoite will enable the comprehensive immune-profiling of humoral immune responses induced by whole parasite vaccines. To address this challenge, a novel ELISA based on sporozoites was developed. The SPZ-ELISA method described in this report can be performed with either freshly dissected sporozoites or with cryopreserved sporozoite lysates. The use of a fixative for reproducible coating is not required. The SPZ-ELISA was first validated using monoclonal antibodies specific for CSP and TRAP and then used for the characterization of immune sera from radiation attenuated sporozoite vaccinees. Applying this simple and highly reproducible approach to assess immune responses induced by malaria vaccines, both recombinant and whole parasite vaccines, (1) will help in the evaluation of immune responses induced by antigenically complex malaria vaccines such as the irradiated SPZ-vaccine, (2) will facilitate and accelerate the identification of immune correlates of protection, and (3) can also be a valuable assessment tool for antigen discovery as well as down-selection of vaccine formulations and, thereby, guide vaccine design.

The radiation-attenuated Plasmodium falciparum sporozoite (PfSPZ) vaccine provides protection against P. falciparum infection in malaria-naïve adults. Preclinical studies show that T cell-mediated immunity is required for protection and is readily induced in humans after vaccination. However, previous malaria exposure can limit immune responses and vaccine efficacy (VE) in adults. We hypothesized that infants with less previous exposure to malaria would have improved immunity and protection. We conducted a multi-arm, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial in 336 infants aged 5-12 months to determine the safety, tolerability, immunogenicity and efficacy of the PfSPZ Vaccine in infants in a high-transmission malaria setting in western Kenya ( NCT02687373 ). Groups of 84 infants each received 4.5 × 10<sup>5</sup>, 9.0 × 10<sup>5</sup> or 1.8 × 10<sup>6</sup> PfSPZ Vaccine or saline three times at 8-week intervals. The vaccine was well tolerated; 52 (20.6%) children in the vaccine groups and 20 (23.8%) in the placebo group experienced related solicited adverse events (AEs) within 28 d postvaccination and most were mild. There was 1 grade 3-related solicited AE in the vaccine group (0.4%) and 2 in the placebo group (2.4%). Seizures were more common in the highest-dose group (14.3%) compared to 6.0% of controls, with most being attributed to malaria. There was no significant protection against P. falciparum infection in any dose group at 6 months (VE in the 9.0 × 10<sup>5</sup> dose group = -6.5%, P = 0.598, the primary statistical end point of the study). VE against clinical malaria 3 months after the last dose in the highest-dose group was 45.8% (P = 0.027), an exploratory end point. There was a dose-dependent increase in antibody responses that correlated with VE at 6 months in the lowest- and highest-dose groups. T cell responses were undetectable across all dose groups. Detection of Vδ2<sup>+</sup>Vγ9<sup>+</sup> T cells, which have been correlated with induction of PfSPZ Vaccine T cell immunity and protection in adults, were infrequent. These data suggest that PfSPZ Vaccine-induced T cell immunity is age-dependent and may be influenced by Vδ2<sup>+</sup>Vγ9<sup>+</sup> T cell frequency. Since there was no significant VE at 6 months in these infants, these vaccine regimens will likely not be pursued further in this age group.

A live-attenuated malaria vaccine, <i>Plasmodium falciparum</i> sporozoite vaccine (PfSPZ Vaccine), confers sterile protection against controlled human malaria infection (CHMI) with <i>Plasmodium falciparum</i> (Pf) parasites homologous to the vaccine strain up to 14 mo after final vaccination. No injectable malaria vaccine has demonstrated long-term protection against CHMI using Pf parasites heterologous to the vaccine strain. Here, we conducted an open-label trial with PfSPZ Vaccine at a dose of 9.0 × 10<sup>5</sup> PfSPZ administered i.v. three times at 8-wk intervals to 15 malaria-naive adults. After CHMI with homologous Pf parasites 19 wk after final immunization, nine (64%) of 14 (95% CI, 35-87%) vaccinated volunteers remained without parasitemia compared with none of six nonvaccinated controls (<i>P</i> = 0.012). Of the nine nonparasitemic subjects, six underwent repeat CHMI with heterologous Pf7G8 parasites 33 wk after final immunization. Five (83%) of six (95% CI, 36-99%) remained without parasitemia compared with none of six nonvaccinated controls. PfSPZ-specific T-cell and antibody responses were detected in all vaccine recipients. Cytokine production by T cells from vaccinated subjects after in vitro stimulation with homologous (NF54) or heterologous (7G8) PfSPZ were highly correlated. Interestingly, PfSPZ-specific T-cell responses in the blood peaked after the first immunization and were not enhanced by subsequent immunizations. Collectively, these data suggest durable protection against homologous and heterologous Pf parasites can be achieved with PfSPZ Vaccine. Ongoing studies will determine whether protective efficacy can be enhanced by additional alterations in the vaccine dose and number of immunizations.

Plasmodium falciparum malaria contributes to a significant global disease burden. Circumsporozoite protein (CSP), the most abundant sporozoite stage antigen, is a prime vaccine candidate. Inhibitory monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) against CSP map to either a short junctional sequence or the central (NPNA)<sub>n</sub> repeat region. We compared in vitro and in vivo activities of six CSP-specific mAbs derived from human recipients of a recombinant CSP vaccine RTS,S/AS01 (mAbs 317 and 311); an irradiated whole sporozoite vaccine PfSPZ (mAbs CIS43 and MGG4); or individuals exposed to malaria (mAbs 580 and 663). RTS,S mAb 317 that specifically binds the (NPNA)<sub>n</sub> epitope, had the highest affinity and it elicited the best sterile protection in mice. The most potent inhibitor of sporozoite invasion in vitro was mAb CIS43 which shows dual-specific binding to the junctional sequence and (NPNA)<sub>n</sub>. In vivo mouse protection was associated with the mAb reactivity to the NANPx6 peptide, the in vitro inhibition of sporozoite invasion activity, and kinetic parameters measured using intact mAbs or their Fab fragments. Buried surface area between mAb and its target epitope was also associated with in vivo protection. Association and disconnects between in vitro and in vivo readouts has important implications for the design and down-selection of the next generation of CSP based interventions.

Immunization with attenuated Plasmodium falciparum sporozoites (PfSPZs) has been shown to be protective against malaria, but the features of the antibody response induced by this treatment remain unclear. To investigate this response in detail, we isolated IgM and IgG monoclonal antibodies from Tanzanian volunteers who were immunized with repeated injection of Sanaria PfSPZ Vaccine and who were found to be protected from controlled human malaria infection with infectious homologous PfSPZs. All isolated IgG monoclonal antibodies bound to P. falciparum circumsporozoite protein (PfCSP) and recognized distinct epitopes in its N terminus, NANP-repeat region, and C terminus. Strikingly, the most effective antibodies, as determined in a humanized mouse model, bound not only to the repeat region, but also to a minimal peptide at the PfCSP N-terminal junction that is not in the RTS,S vaccine. These dual-specific antibodies were isolated from different donors and were encoded by VH3-30 or VH3-33 alleles that encode tryptophan or arginine at position 52. Using structural and mutational data, we describe the elements required for germline recognition and affinity maturation. Our study provides potent neutralizing antibodies and relevant information for lineage-targeted vaccine design and immunization strategies.

We are using controlled human malaria infection (CHMI) by direct venous inoculation (DVI) of cryopreserved, infectious <i>Plasmodium falciparum</i> (Pf) sporozoites (SPZ) (PfSPZ Challenge) to try to reduce time and costs of developing PfSPZ Vaccine to prevent malaria in Africa. Immunization with five doses at 0, 4, 8, 12, and 20 weeks of 2.7 × 10<sup>5</sup> PfSPZ of PfSPZ Vaccine gave 65% vaccine efficacy (VE) at 24 weeks against mosquito bite CHMI in U.S. adults and 52% (time to event) or 29% (proportional) VE over 24 weeks against naturally transmitted Pf in Malian adults. We assessed the identical regimen in Tanzanians for VE against PfSPZ Challenge. Twenty- to thirty-year-old men were randomized to receive five doses normal saline or PfSPZ Vaccine in a double-blind trial. Vaccine efficacy was assessed 3 and 24 weeks later. Adverse events were similar in vaccinees and controls. Antibody responses to Pf circumsporozoite protein were significantly lower than in malaria-naïve Americans, but significantly higher than in Malians. All 18 controls developed Pf parasitemia after CHMI. Four of 20 (20%) vaccinees remained uninfected after 3 week CHMI (<i>P</i> = 0.015 by time to event, <i>P</i> = 0.543 by proportional analysis) and all four (100%) were uninfected after repeat 24 week CHMI (<i>P</i> = 0.005 by proportional, <i>P</i> = 0.004 by time to event analysis). <i>Plasmodium falciparum</i> SPZ Vaccine was safe, well tolerated, and induced durable VE in four subjects. Controlled human malaria infection by DVI of PfSPZ Challenge appeared more stringent over 24 weeks than mosquito bite CHMI in United States or natural exposure in Malian adults, thereby providing a rigorous test of VE in Africa.

An attenuated Plasmodium falciparum (Pf) sporozoite (SPZ) vaccine, PfSPZ Vaccine, is highly protective against controlled human malaria infection (CHMI) 3 weeks after immunization, but the durability of protection is unknown. We assessed how vaccine dosage, regimen, and route of administration affected durable protection in malaria-naive adults. After four intravenous immunizations with 2.7 × 10(5) PfSPZ, 6/11 (55%) vaccinated subjects remained without parasitemia following CHMI 21 weeks after immunization. Five non-parasitemic subjects from this dosage group underwent repeat CHMI at 59 weeks, and none developed parasitemia. Although Pf-specific serum antibody levels correlated with protection up to 21-25 weeks after immunization, antibody levels waned substantially by 59 weeks. Pf-specific T cell responses also declined in blood by 59 weeks. To determine whether T cell responses in blood reflected responses in liver, we vaccinated nonhuman primates with PfSPZ Vaccine. Pf-specific interferon-γ-producing CD8 T cells were present at ∼100-fold higher frequencies in liver than in blood. Our findings suggest that PfSPZ Vaccine conferred durable protection to malaria through long-lived tissue-resident T cells and that administration of higher doses may further enhance protection.

In 2013 there were an estimated 584,000 deaths and 198 million clinical illnesses due to malaria, the majority in sub-Saharan Africa. Vaccines would be the ideal addition to the existing armamentarium of anti-malaria tools. However, malaria is caused by parasites, and parasites are much more complex in terms of their biology than the viruses and bacteria for which we have vaccines, passing through multiple stages of development in the human host, each stage expressing hundreds of unique antigens. This complexity makes it more difficult to develop a vaccine for parasites than for viruses and bacteria, since an immune response targeting one stage may not offer protection against a later stage, because different antigens are the targets of protective immunity at different stages. Furthermore, depending on the life cycle stage and whether the parasite is extra- or intra-cellular, antibody and/or cellular immune responses provide protection. It is thus not surprising that there is no vaccine on the market for prevention of malaria, or any human parasitic infection. In fact, no vaccine for any disease with this breadth of targets and immune responses exists. In this limited review, we focus on four approaches to malaria vaccines, (1) a recombinant protein with adjuvant vaccine aimed at Plasmodium falciparum (Pf) pre-erythrocytic stages of the parasite cycle (RTS,S/AS01), (2) whole sporozoite vaccines aimed at Pf pre-erythrocytic stages (PfSPZ Vaccine and PfSPZ-CVac), (3) prime boost vaccines that include recombinant DNA, viruses and bacteria, and protein with adjuvant aimed primarily at Pf pre-erythrocytic, but also asexual erythrocytic stages, and (4) recombinant protein with adjuvant vaccines aimed at Pf and Plasmodium vivax sexual erythrocytic and mosquito stages. We recognize that we are not covering all approaches to malaria vaccine development, or most of the critically important work on development of vaccines against P. vivax, the second most important cause of malaria. Progress during the last few years has been significant, and a first generation malaria candidate vaccine, RTS,S/AS01, is under review by the European Medicines Agency (EMA) for its quality, safety and efficacy under article 58, which allows the EMA to give a scientific opinion about products intended exclusively for markets outside of the European Union. However, much work is in progress to optimize malaria vaccines in regard to magnitude and durability of protective efficacy and the financing and practicality of delivery. Thus, we are hopeful that anti-malaria vaccines will soon be important tools in the battle against malaria.
