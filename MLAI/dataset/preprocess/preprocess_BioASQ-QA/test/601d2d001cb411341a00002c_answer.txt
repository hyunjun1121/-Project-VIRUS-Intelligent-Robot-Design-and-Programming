IDEAL_ANSWER:
- Dysfunction of the ciliary ARMC9/TOGARAM1 protein module causes Joubert syndrome.
- Dysfunction of the ciliary ARMC9/TOGARAM1 protein causes Joubert syndrome.
- Joubert syndrome (JBTS) is a recessive neurodevelopmental disorder caused by dysfunction of the ciliary ARMC9/TOGARAM1 protein.
- Dysfunction of the ciliary ARMC9/TOGARAM1 protein module causes Joubert syndrome. All known JBTS genes encode proteins involved in the structure or function of primary cilia, ubiquitous antenna-like organelles essential for cellular signal transduction.
- Joubert syndrome is a rare autosomal recessive disorder caused by dysfunction of the ciliary ARMC9/TOGARAM1 protein.
- Dysfunction of the ciliary ARMC9/TOGARAM1 protein module causes Joubert syndrome. Joubert syndrome (JBTS) is a recessive neurodevelopmental ciliopathy characterized by a pathognomonic hindbrain malformation.
- Joubert syndrome (JBTS) is a rare autosomal recessive disorder caused by dysfunction of the ciliary ARMC9/TOGARAM1 protein.
