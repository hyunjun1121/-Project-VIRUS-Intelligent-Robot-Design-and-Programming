Atopic dermatitis (AD) is a widely acquired, relapsing inflammatory skin disease. Biologics are now widely used in patients with moderate-to-severe AD. This work aims to summarize both label and off-label biologics on AD treatment in phase II and phase III stages, and compile evidence on the efficacy of the most-studied biologics. We conducted a comprehensive literature search through PubMed, EMBASE, and ClinicalTrials.gov to identify all documented biological therapies for AD. The criteria were further refined to focus on those treatments with the highest evidence level for AD with at least one randomized clinical trial supporting their use. Only studies or articles published in English were enrolled in this study. Primary searches identified 525 relevant articles and 27 trials. Duplicated articles and papers without a full text were excluded. Only completed trials were enrolled. We included 28 randomized controlled trials, 4 unpublished trials, 2 observational studies, and 1 meta-analysis. Eight kinds of biologics, including IL-4/IL-13 inhibitors, JAK inhibitors, anti-IL-13 antibodies, anti-IL-22 antibodies, anti-IL-33 antibodies, thymic stromal lymphopoietin inhibitor (TSLP), OX40 antibodies, and H4R-antagonists were included in this work. Dupliumab, as the most widely used and investigated biologic, was reported in 1 meta-analysis and 4 trials exploring its long-term use and application in both adults and pediatric patients. Besides dupilumab, four other IL-4/IL-13 inhibitors recruited were all randomized, clinical trials at phase 2-3 stage. Six different kinds of JAK inhibitors were summarized with strong evidence revealing their significant therapeutic effects on AD. There were 3 trials for nemolizumab, an anti-IL-13 antibody, all of which were in the phase 2 clinical trial stage. Results showed nemolizumab could be another alternative therapy for moderate-to-severe AD with long-term efficiency and safety. The biological therapies with the most robust evidence on efficacy and long-term safety for AD treatment include dupilumab, barcitinib, abrocitinib, and delgocitinib. Most of the biologics mentioned in this review were still at the exploratory stage. This review will help practitioners advise patients seeking suitable biological therapies and offer experimental study directions for treatment.

Atopic dermatitis (AD) is a common inflammatory dermatologic disease clinically characterized by intense itch, recurrent eczematous lesions, and a chronic or relapsing disease course. Mild-to-moderate AD can be controlled by using moisturizers and topical immunomodulators such as topical corticosteroids and calcineurin inhibitors. If topical therapies fail, phototherapy and systemic immunosuppressant therapies, such as ciclosporin, methotrexate, and azathioprine, can be considered. However, relapse and side effects could still occur. The pathogenesis of AD involves epidermal barrier dysfunction, skin microbiome abnormalities, and cutaneous inflammation. Inflammatory mediators, such as interleukin (IL)-4, IL-13, IL-31, IL-33, IL-17, IL-23, and thymic stromal lymphopoietin, are involved in AD development. Therefore, a series of biological agents targeting these cytokines are promising approaches for treating AD. Dupilumab is the first biological agent approved for the treatment of AD in patients aged 6 years and older in the United States. Tralokinumab, lebrikizumab, and nemolizumab have also been confirmed to have significant efficacy against AD in phase III or IIb clinical trials. Also, fezakinumab was effective in severe AD patients in a phase IIa trial. However, phase II trials of ustekinumab, tezepelumab, etokimab, secukinumab, and omalizumab have failed to meet their primary endpoints. Phase II trials of GBR 830 and KHK 4083 are ongoing. In general, further studies are needed to explore new therapeutic targets and improve the efficacy of biological agents.

Biologic medications are recent advances that have clinical significance in the treatment of moderate-to-severe AD. A systemic literature review was performed to examine the efficacy and safety of biologic therapies currently in phase II and phase III of clinical trials for moderate-to-severe AD. Our team searched the databases, PubMed, Google Scholar, and ClinicalTrials.gov, on September 2019 for studies pertaining to the use of biologic drugs in AD. Key words included each drug (lebrikizumab, tralokinumab, fezakinumab, etokimab, nemolizumab, tezepelumab, and GBR 830) or 'biologic drugs' or 'immunotherapies' combined with 'atopic dermatitis.' References within retrieved articles were also reviewed to identify potentially missed studies. A total of 19 articles were included in this review. Lebrikizumab, tralokinumab, fezakinumab, nemolizumab, and GBR 830 lead to statistically significant improvements in disease severity and multiple endpoint outcome scores. Tezepelumab and etokimab, however, did not demonstrate statistically significant changes in primary outcome endpoints. Further assessment of tezepelumab and etokimab are needed to assess their safety and efficacy in patients with moderate-to-severe AD. Tralokinumab, lebrikizumab, fezakinumab, nemolizumab, and GBR 830 are effective treatment options for adults with moderate-to-severe AD, but further large-scale studies are needed to confirm their efficacy as monotherapy in children with moderate-to-severe AD.

Nemolizumab, an anti-IL-31 receptor A mAb, improved pruritus, dermatitis, and sleep in adults with moderate-to-severe atopic dermatitis that was inadequately controlled by topical treatments in a phase II, 12-week, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study (part A; NCT01986933). We sought to assess the long-term efficacy and safety of nemolizumab injected subcutaneously every 4 weeks (Q4W) or every 8 weeks (Q8W) in a 52-week, double-blind extension (part B). During part B, patients continued the previous nemolizumab dose (0.1, 0.5, or 2.0 mg/kg Q4W or 2.0 mg/kg Q8W). Part B end points included percentage improvement from baseline in pruritus visual analog scale and dermatitis scores (including the Eczema Area and Severity Index). Overall, 216 of 264 patients completed part A, and 191 entered part B; 131 completed part B. In 153 patients randomized to nemolizumab in part A, improvement from baseline in pruritus visual analog scale score was maintained/increased from weeks 12 to 64, with greatest improvement in the 0.5-mg/kg Q4W group (percentage change from baseline at week 64: -73.0, -89.6, -74.7, and -79.1 in the 0.1-, 0.5-, and 2.0-mg/kg Q4W and 2.0-mg/kg Q8W groups, respectively). Improvement from baseline in dermatitis scores was also maintained/increased to week 64 (percentage change in Eczema Area and Severity Index score: -68.5, -75.8, -78.9, and -69.3 in the 0.1-, 0.5-, and 2.0-mg/kg Q4W and 2.0-mg/kg Q8W groups, respectively). Over 64 weeks, 83% to 89% had 1 or more adverse events, with no new safety concerns identified. Nemolizumab for up to 64 weeks was efficacious and overall well tolerated in patients with moderate-to-severe atopic dermatitis inadequately controlled by topical therapy.

Nemolizumab is a humanized anti-interleukin-31 receptor A monoclonal antibody for treating atopic dermatitis, and it especially improves pruritus. The objective of the simulation study was to optimize the dose regimen using a flat dose. The serum nemolizumab concentration and pruritus visual analog scale as an efficacy end point were modeled using the population analysis approach in 299 patients with atopic dermatitis who received placebo or doses between 0.1 and 3 mg/kg as a single dose once every 4 weeks or 2 mg/kg once every 8 weeks. A 1-compartment model with first-order absorption was employed as the pharmacokinetic model. An indirect turnover model with an inhibition component was employed as the main part of the pharmacokinetic-pharmacodynamic model. The models well described the observations. Therefore, simulations with several dose regimens were performed to optimize the dose regimen including a flat dose. The simulated area under the concentration-time curve at a steady state around 75 mg in the every-4-week regimen corresponds to that associated with the dose range of 0.5 to 2 mg/kg in the 4-week regimen. The simulated pruritus visual analog scale also showed a similar tendency. These simulation results support dose optimization during the clinical development program of nemolizumab.

Nemolizumab is a subcutaneously administered humanized monoclonal antibody against interleukin-31 receptor A, which is involved in pruritus and inflammation in atopic dermatitis. In phase 2 studies, nemolizumab lessened the severity of atopic dermatitis. In a 16-week, double-blind, phase 3 trial, we randomly assigned Japanese patients with atopic dermatitis and moderate-to-severe pruritus and an inadequate response to topical agents in a 2:1 ratio to receive subcutaneous nemolizumab (60 mg) or placebo every 4 weeks until week 16, with concomitant topical agents. The primary end point was the mean percent change in the visual-analogue scale (VAS) score for pruritus (range, 0 to 100, with higher scores indicating worse pruritus) from baseline to week 16. Secondary end points included the time course of change in the VAS score for pruritus up to week 4, the change in the Eczema Area and Severity Index (EASI) score (range, 0 to 72, with higher scores indicating greater severity), a score of 4 or less on the Dermatology Life Quality Index (DLQI; range, 0 to 30, with higher scores indicating a greater effect on daily life), a score of 7 or less on the Insomnia Severity Index (ISI; range, 0 to 28, with higher scores indicating greater severity), and safety. A total of 143 patients were randomly assigned to receive nemolizumab and 72 to receive placebo. The median VAS score for pruritus at baseline was 75. At week 16, the mean percent change in the VAS score was -42.8% in the nemolizumab group and -21.4% in the placebo group (difference, -21.5 percentage points; 95% confidence interval, -30.2 to -12.7; P<0.001). The mean percent change in the EASI score was -45.9% with nemolizumab and -33.2% with placebo. The percentage of patients with a DLQI score of 4 or less was 40% in the nemolizumab group and 22% in the placebo group; the percentage of patients with an ISI score of 7 or less was 55% and 21%, respectively. The incidence of injection-related reactions was 8% with nemolizumab and 3% with placebo. In this 16-week trial, the use of subcutaneous nemolizumab in addition to topical agents for atopic dermatitis resulted in a greater reduction in pruritus than placebo plus topical agents. The incidence of injection-site reactions was greater with nemolizumab than with placebo. Longer and larger trials are necessary to determine whether nemolizumab has a durable effect and is safe for atopic dermatitis. (Funded by Maruho; JapicCTI number, 173740.).

The mainstay of atopic dermatitis treatment has been largely unchanged over the last few decades. With improved understanding of the immunologic pathways underlying atopic dermatitis in recent years, targeted biologic therapies are being developed. Discuss efficacy and safety profiles of emerging biologics in phase 2 and 3 clinical trials. A systemic literature review was conducted to identify results of randomized, placebo-controlled trials of monoclonal antibodies up to March 1, 2020 for the treatment of atopic dermatitis. Targeted biologics appear to have acceptable safety profiles. Dupilumab, lebrikizumab, and nemolizumab demonstrate efficacy as agents producing improvement in clinical severity and pruritus. The growing class of biologics shows promise in meeting the needs of treatment-resistant atopic dermatitis. The use of validated core measurements is necessary for future trials in order to adequately compare agents and progress evidence-based medicine.

Interleukin (IL)-31 affects the inflammatory response, is involved in epidermal barrier disruption in atopic dermatitis (AD) and plays a key role in pruritus. Nemolizumab, a humanized monoclonal antibody against IL-31 receptor A, reduced pruritus in patients with AD after a 16-week administration period. To examine the long-term effectiveness and safety of nemolizumab in patients aged ≥ 13 years with AD and inadequately controlled moderate-to-severe pruritus. In two long-term phase III studies, nemolizumab 60 mg every 4 weeks (Q4W) was administered subcutaneously, concomitantly with topical treatments. Study-JP01 patients received double-blind nemolizumab or placebo for 16 weeks, and then entered a 52-week extension period in which all patients received nemolizumab (nemolizumab/nemolizumab and placebo/nemolizumab groups). Study-JP02 patients received nemolizumab for 52 weeks. Both studies included an 8-week follow-up period. Study-JP01 nemolizumab/nemolizumab and placebo/nemolizumab, and Study-JP02 nemolizumab groups comprised 143, 72 and 88 patients, respectively. In the nemolizumab/nemolizumab group, there were clinically meaningful improvements from the start of treatment to week 68 in the pruritus visual analogue scale (66% decrease) and Eczema Area and Severity Index (78% decrease). Quality of life (QoL) indicators improved after the first nemolizumab dose; improvements were maintained during the follow-up period. The long-term safety profile was consistent with previous studies, with no unexpected late-onset adverse events. Nemolizumab 60 mg Q4W with concomitant topical treatments in patients with AD and inadequately controlled moderate-to-severe pruritus produced a continuous improvement in pruritus, signs of AD, and QoL for up to 68 weeks, with a favourable safety profile.

Nemolizumab targets the IL-31 receptor α subunit involved in atopic dermatitis (AD) pathogenesis. We sought to evaluate a new dosing strategy of nemolizumab in patients with AD. We performed a 24-week, randomized, double-blind, multicenter study of nemolizumab (10, 30, and 90 mg) subcutaneous injections every 4 weeks versus placebo, with topical corticosteroids in adults with moderate-to-severe AD, severe pruritus, and inadequate control with topical treatment (n = 226). The Eczema Area and Severity Index (EASI), the peak pruritus (PP) numeric rating scale (NRS), and the Investigator's Global Assessment (IGA) were assessed. Standard safety assessments were performed. Nemolizumab improved EASI, IGA, and/or NRS-itch scores, with the 30-mg dose being most effective. Nemolizumab (30 mg) reduced EASI scores versus placebo at week 24 (-68.8% vs -52.1%, P = .016); significant differences were observed by week 8 (P ≤ .01). With significant improvement (P = .028) as early as week 4, IGA 0/1 rates were higher for 30 mg of nemolizumab versus placebo at week 16 (33.3% vs 12.3%, P = .008) but not week 24 because of an increased placebo/topical corticosteroid effect (36.8% vs 21.1%, P = .06). PP-NRS scores were improved for 30 mg of nemolizumab versus placebo at week 16 (-68.6% vs -34.3%, P < .0001) and week 24 (-67.3% vs -35.8%, P < .0001), with a difference by week 1 (P < .001). NRS response rates (≥4-point decrease) were greater for 30 mg of nemolizumab versus placebo at week 16 (P ≤ .001) and week 24 (P ≤ .01). Nemolizumab was safe and well tolerated. The most common adverse events were nasopharyngitis and upper respiratory tract infection. Nemolizumab resulted in rapid and sustained improvements in cutaneous signs of inflammation and pruritus in patients with AD, with maximal efficacy observed at 30 mg. Nemolizumab had an acceptable safety profile.

Skin inflammation often evokes pruritus, which is the major subjective symptom in many inflammatory skin diseases such as atopic dermatitis and prurigo nodularis. Pruritus or itch is a specific sensation found only in the skin. Recent studies have stressed the pivotal role played by interleukin-31 (IL-31) in the sensation of pruritus. IL-31 is produced by various cells including T helper 2 cells, macrophages, dendritic cells and eosinophils. IL-31 signals via a heterodimeric receptor composed of IL-31 receptor A (IL-31RA) and oncostatin M receptor β. Recent clinical trials have shown that the anti-IL-31RA antibody nemolizumab can successfully decrease pruritus in patients with atopic dermatitis and prurigo nodularis. The IL-31 pathway and pruritic skin are highlighted in this review article.

Pruritus represents one of the most common symptoms in dermatology and general medicine. Chronic pruritus severely impairs the quality of life of affected patients. During the last two decades a number of modulators and mediator of pruritus have been identified. Recently, Interleukin (IL)-31 and its receptor complex attracted significant interest, as clinical phase two studies demonstrated therapeutic efficacy of the neutralizing IL-31 receptor A (IL-31RA) antibody nemolizumab in patients suffering from atopic dermatitis or prurigo nodularis. IL-31 has also been shown to play relevant roles in allergic contact dermatitis, urticaria, mastocytosis, allergic rhinitis and asthma. Here, we summarize the current knowledge of the novel cytokine IL-31 and its receptor regarding cellular origin, regulation, signaling pathways and their involvement in biological processes such as pruritus, neuronal growth, inflammation, barrier dysfunction and tissue remodeling.

Interleukin-31 may play a role in the pathobiologic mechanism of atopic dermatitis and pruritus. We wanted to assess the efficacy and safety of nemolizumab (CIM331), a humanized antibody against interleukin-31 receptor A, in the treatment of atopic dermatitis. In this phase 2, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, 12-week trial, we assigned adults with moderate-to-severe atopic dermatitis that was inadequately controlled by topical treatments to receive subcutaneous nemolizumab (at a dose of 0.1 mg, 0.5 mg, or 2.0 mg per kilogram of body weight) or placebo every 4 weeks or an exploratory dose of 2.0 mg of nemolizumab per kilogram every 8 weeks. The primary end point was the percentage improvement from baseline in the score on the pruritus visual-analogue scale (on which a negative change indicates improvement) at week 12. Secondary end points included changes in the score on the Eczema Area and Severity Index (EASI, on which a negative change indicates improvement), and body-surface area of atopic dermatitis. Of 264 patients who underwent randomization, 216 (82%) completed the study. At week 12, among the patients who received nemolizumab every 4 weeks, changes on the pruritus visual-analogue scale were -43.7% in the 0.1-mg group, -59.8% in the 0.5-mg group, and -63.1% in the 2.0-mg group, versus -20.9% in the placebo group (P<0.01 for all comparisons). Changes on the EASI were -23.0%, -42.3%, and -40.9%, respectively, in the nemolizumab groups, versus -26.6% in the placebo group. Respective changes in body-surface area affected by atopic dermatitis were -7.5%, -20.0%, and -19.4% with nemolizumab, versus -15.7% with placebo. Among the patients receiving nemolizumab every 4 weeks, treatment discontinuations occurred in 9 of 53 patients (17%) in the 0.1-mg group, in 9 of 54 (17%) in the 0.5-mg group, and in 7 of 52 (13%) in the 2.0-mg group, versus in 9 of 53 (17%) in the placebo group. In this phase 2 trial, nemolizumab at all monthly doses significantly improved pruritus in patients with moderate-to-severe atopic dermatitis, which showed the efficacy of targeting interleukin-31 receptor A. The limited size and length of the trial preclude conclusions regarding adverse events. (Funded by Chugai Pharmaceutical; XCIMA ClinicalTrials.gov number, NCT01986933 .).

Prurigo nodularis is a chronic pruritic skin disease with multiple nodular skin lesions. Nemolizumab is a monoclonal antibody targeting the interleukin-31 receptor, which is involved in the pathogenesis of prurigo nodularis. We conducted a 12-week, randomized, double-blind, phase 2 trial of nemolizumab (at a dose of 0.5 mg per kilogram of body weight) administered subcutaneously at baseline, week 4, and week 8, as compared with placebo, in patients with moderate-to-severe prurigo nodularis and severe pruritus. Moderate-to-severe prurigo nodularis was defined as 20 or more nodules, and severe pruritus was defined as a mean score of at least 7 for the worst daily intensity of pruritus on the numerical rating scale (scores range from 0 [no itch] to 10 [worst itch imaginable]). The primary outcome was the percent change from baseline in the mean peak score for pruritus on the numerical rating scale at week 4. Secondary outcomes included additional measures of itching and disease severity. Safety assessments were performed through week 18. A total of 70 patients were randomly assigned in a 1:1 ratio to receive nemolizumab (34 patients) or placebo (36). The initial pruritus score on the numerical rating scale was 8.4 in each group. At week 4, the peak pruritus score on the numerical rating scale was reduced from baseline by 4.5 points (change, -53.0%) in the nemolizumab group, as compared with a reduction of 1.7 points (change, -20.2%) in the placebo group (difference, -32.8 percentage points; 95% confidence interval, -46.8 to -18.8; P<0.001). Results for secondary outcomes were in the same direction as for the primary outcome. Nemolizumab was associated with gastrointestinal symptoms (abdominal pain and diarrhea) and musculoskeletal symptoms. Nemolizumab resulted in a greater reduction in pruritus and severity of skin lesions than placebo in patients with prurigo nodularis but was associated with adverse events. Larger and longer trials are needed to determine the durability and safety of nemolizumab for the treatment of prurigo nodularis. (Funded by Galderma; ClinicalTrials.gov number, NCT03181503.).

Nemolizumab is a humanized anti-IL-31 receptor blocker in phase 3 for atopic dermatitis (AD). Analyse onset of action of nemolizumab 30 mg and compare efficacy and safety vs placebo (SC q4wk plus loading dose) in moderate-to-severe AD. Post hoc analysis of patients with Eczema Area and Severity Index (EASI) scores ≥ 16 from a phase 2b trial of moderate-to-severe AD. Endpoints were change in EASI score at week 16, peak pruritus numeric rating scale (PP-NRS), Investigator's Global Assessment (IGA), changes in sleep and responders with ≥ 4-point improvement on PP-NRS. There was a significantly greater itch relief apparent by Day 2 (-22.8% vs -12.3% PP-NRS; P = 0.005) which continued to improve through week 16 (-68.5% vs -30.9% PP-NRS; P < 0.001). At week 16, PP-NRS ≥ 4-point response of itch was observed in 68.0% nemolizumab vs 15.9% placebo patients (P ≤ 0.001). There was also a rapid improvement of sleep disturbance with nemolizumab 30 mg, with a significant separation from placebo by Day 3 (-26.6% vs -9.0%; P < 0.001) which further improved till week 16 (-76.0% vs -36.5%; P < 0.001). Also for the EASI score a separation between groups in favour of nemolizumab was observed by week 1 (P ≤ 0.001), which increased through week 16 (-68.6% vs. -42.6%; P = 0.002). Finally, the degree of response was greater in nemolizumab-treated patients; clinically relevant reductions of 75% EASI were observed in 50.0% of nemolizumab patients versus 15.9% of placebo patients, while 90% reductions were reported for 36.0% and 6.8% of patients, respectively (P < 0.001 for both). IGA success (score of 0/1) was 32.0% for nemolizumab vs 6.8% for placebo (P = 0.002). Nemolizumab was safe and well-tolerated in this population; nasopharyngitis and upper respiratory tract infection were the most common adverse events. Nemolizumab resulted in very rapid, sustained improvements of inflammation, pruritus and sleep in patients with EASI ≥ 16 at baseline.
