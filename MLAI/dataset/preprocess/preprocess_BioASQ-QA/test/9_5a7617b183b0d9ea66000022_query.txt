[PMID: 27568322]
Despite improvements in systemic chemotherapy (CT), the prognosis of metastatic adenocarcinoma of the gastroesophageal junction remains poor. Over the years, new targeting agents have become available and were tested, with or without CT, in first or subsequent lines of therapy. The epidermal growth factor receptor family was targeted with monoclonal antibodies (MoAbs) (trastuzumab, cetuximab, panitumumab) and tyrosin kinase inhibitors (TKIs) (lapatinib, erlotinib, gefitinib). Only trastuzumab, in combination with cisplatin and fluoropyrimidines, significantly improved overall survival (OS) in first-line therapy (13.8 vs. 11.1 months). Angiogenesis also was targeted with MoAbs (bevacizumab and ramucirumab); ramucirumab, a vascular endothelial growth factor-receptor 2 antagonist, enhanced OS in two phase III studies in the first (9.6 vs. 7.4 months) and subsequent lines of treatment (5.2 vs. 3.8 months), while the bevacizumab study was negative. TKIs (sunitinib, sorafenib, regorafenib, apatinib) were tested in this setting in phase II studies in the second/third line, only showing modest antitumor activity. The hepatocyte growth factor receptor (MET) was targeted in untreated patients in a phase III trial with MoAb rilotumumab, with or without CT, but the study was stopped because of mortality excess in the rilotumumab arm. Mammalian target of rapamycin (MTOR) pathway inhibition with everolimus was tested in pretreated patients in a placebo-controlled phase III trial who failed to improve OS (5.4 vs. 4.3 months). In conclusion, considering the modest survival gain obtained overall, the high cost of these therapies and the quality of life issue must be primarily considered in treating these patients.

Activation of the mesenchymal-epidermal transition factor (MET) tyrosine kinase and its ligand, hepatocyte growth factor (HGF), is implicated in resistance to epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) inhibitors. In this phase 1/2 trial, rilotumumab (an anti-HGF antibody) combined with erlotinib was evaluated in patients with metastatic, previously treated non-small cell lung cancer. In phase 1, a dose de-escalation design was adopted with rilotumumab starting at 15 mg/kg intravenously every 3 weeks and oral erlotinib 150 mg daily. In phase 2, the disease control rate (DCR) (according to Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors) of the combination was evaluated using a Simon 2-stage design. The biomarkers examined included 10 plasma-circulating molecules associated with the EGFR and MET pathways. Without indications for de-escalation, the recommended phase 2 dose was dose level 0. Overall, 45 response-evaluable patients were enrolled (13 with squamous carcinoma, 32 with adenocarcinoma; 2 had confirmed EGFR mutations, 33 had confirmed wild-type [WT] EGFR, and 7 had KRAS mutations). The DCR for all patients was 60% (90% confidence interval [CI], 47.1%-71.3%). Median progression-free survival was 2.6 months (90% CI, 1.4-2.7 months), and median overall survival was 6.6 months (90% CI, 5.6-8.9 months). Among patients with WT EGFR, the DCR was 60.6% (90% CI, 46.3%-73.3%), median progression-free survival was 2.6 months (90% CI, 1.4-2.7 months), and median overall survival was 7.0 months (90% CI, 5.6-13.4 months). Elevated baseline levels of neuregulin 1 were associated with longer progression-free survival (hazard ratio, 0.41; 95% CI, 0.19-0.87), whereas elevated amphiregulin levels were associated with more rapid progression (hazard ratio, 2.14; 95% CI, 1.48-3.08). Combined rilotumumab and erlotinib had an acceptable safety profile, and the DCR met the prespecified criteria for success. In the EGFR WT group, the DCR exceeded published reports for erlotinib alone. High circulating levels of neuregulin 1 may indicate sensitivity to this combination.

The hepatocyte growth factor (HGF) binding antibody rilotumumab (AMG102) was modified for use as a <sup>89</sup>Zr-based immuno-PET imaging agent to noninvasively determine the local levels of HGF protein in tumors. Because recent clinical trials of HGF-targeting therapies have been largely unsuccessful in several different cancers (e.g., gastric, brain, lung), we have synthesized and validated <sup>89</sup>Zr-DFO-AMG102 as a companion diagnostic for improved identification and selection of patients having high local levels of HGF in tumors. To date, patient selection has not been performed using the local levels of HGF protein in tumors. <b>Methods:</b> The chelator <i>p</i>-SCN-Bn-DFO was conjugated to AMG102, radiolabeling with <sup>89</sup>Zr was performed in high radiochemical yields and purity (>99%), and binding affinity of the modified antibody was confirmed using an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA)-type binding assay. PET imaging, biodistribution, autoradiography and immunohistochemistry, and ex vivo HGF ELISA experiments were performed on murine xenografts of U87MG (HGF-positive, MET-positive) and MKN45 (HGF-negative, MET-positive) and 4 patient-derived xenografts (MET-positive, HGF unknown). <b>Results:</b> Tumor uptake of <sup>89</sup>Zr-DFO-AMG102 at 120 h after injection in U87MG xenografts (HGF-positive) was high (36.8 ± 7.8 percentage injected dose per gram [%ID/g]), whereas uptake in MKN45 xenografts (HGF-negative) was 5.0 ± 1.3 %ID/g and a control of nonspecific human IgG <sup>89</sup>Zr-DFO-IgG in U87MG tumors was 11.5 ± 3.3 %ID/g, demonstrating selective uptake in HGF-positive tumors. Similar experiments performed in 4 different gastric cancer patient-derived xenograft models showed low uptake of <sup>89</sup>Zr-DFO-AMG102 (∼4-7 %ID/g), which corresponded with low HGF levels in these tumors (ex vivo ELISA). Autoradiography, immunohistochemical staining, and HGF ELISA assays confirmed that elevated levels of HGF protein were present only in U87MG tumors and that <sup>89</sup>Zr-DFO-AMG102 uptake was closely correlated with HGF protein levels in tumors. <b>Conclusion:</b> The new immuno-PET imaging agent <sup>89</sup>Zr-DFO-AMG102 was successfully synthesized, radiolabeled, and validated in vitro and in vivo to selectively accumulate in tumors with high local levels of HGF protein. These results suggest that <sup>89</sup>Zr-DFO-AMG102 would be a valuable companion diagnostic tool for the noninvasive selection of patients with elevated local concentrations of HGF in tumors for planning any HGF-targeted therapy, with the potential to improve clinical outcomes.

Rilotumumab is a fully human monoclonal antibody investigated for the treatment of MET-positive gastric cancer. The aim of this study was to evaluate the potential pharmacokinetic (PK)-based drug-drug interaction (DDI) between rilotumumab and epirubicin (E), cisplatin(C) and capecitabine (X). This was a Phase 3 double-blind, placebo-controlled study, in which rilotumumab, epirubicin and cisplatin were administered intravenously at 15 mg kg<sup>-1</sup> , 50 mg m<sup>-2</sup> , and 60 mg m<sup>-2</sup> Q3W, respectively, while capecitabine was given orally at 625 mg m<sup>-2</sup> twice daily. Rilotumumab PK samples were taken at pre-dose and at the end-of-infusion from all patients in cycles 1, 3, 5 and 7. ECX PK samples were taken in cycle 3 from patients who participated in the intensive PK assessment. ECX PK was assessed by non-compartmental (NCA) analyses and PK parameters were compared between two arms. Rilotumumab PK was assessed by comparing the observed rilotumumab serum concentrations with model-predicted concentrations using a population PK model developed from previous Phase 1 and Phase 2 studies. The study enrolled 609 patients. ECX plasma concentrations in the presence and absence of rilotumumab were similar, as demonstrated by the geometric mean ratios for C<sub>max</sub> and AUC, which were close to 1.0, suggesting ECX PK was not affected by co-administration of rilotumumab. The observed rilotumumab serum concentrations were similar to the values predicted by population PK modelling on the basis of a prediction-corrected visual predictive check, indicating rilotumumab exposure was not affected by co-administration of ECX. The results suggest lack of PK-based DDI between rilotumumab and ECX.

Rilotumumab is a fully human monoclonal antibody that selectively targets the ligand of the MET receptor, hepatocyte growth factor (HGF). We aimed to assess the efficacy, safety, and pharmacokinetics of rilotumumab combined with epirubicin, cisplatin, and capecitabine, and to assess potential biomarkers, in patients with advanced MET-positive gastric or gastro-oesophageal junction adenocarcinoma. This multicentre, randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled, phase 3 study was done at 152 centres in 27 countries. We recruited adults (aged ≥18 years) with unresectable locally advanced or metastatic gastric or gastro-oesophageal junction adenocarcinoma, an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status of 0 or 1, MET-positive tumours (≥25% of tumour cells with membrane staining of ≥1+ staining intensity), and evaluable disease, who had not received previous systemic therapy. Eligible patients were randomly assigned (1:1) via a computerised voice response system to receive rilotumumab 15 mg/kg intravenously or placebo in combination with open-label chemotherapy (epirubicin 50 mg/m<sup>2</sup> intravenously; cisplatin 60 mg/m<sup>2</sup> intravenously; capecitabine 625 mg/m<sup>2</sup> orally twice daily) in 21-day cycles for up to ten cycles. After completion of chemotherapy, patients continued to receive rilotumumab or placebo monotherapy until disease progression, intolerability, withdrawal of consent, or study termination. Randomisation was stratified by disease extent and ECOG performance status. Both patients and physicians were masked to study treatment assignment. The primary endpoint was overall survival, analysed by intention to treat. We report the final analysis. This study is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT01697072. Between Nov 7, 2012, and Nov 21, 2014, 609 patients were randomly assigned to rilotumumab plus epirubicin, cisplatin, and capecitabine (rilotumumab group; n=304) or placebo plus epirubicin, cisplatin, and capecitabine (placebo group; n=305). Study treatment was stopped early after an independent data monitoring committee found a higher number of deaths in the rilotumumab group than in the placebo group; all patients in the rilotumumab group subsequently discontinued all study treatment. Median follow-up was 7·7 months (IQR 3·6-12·0) for patients in the rilotumumab group and 9·4 months (5·3-13·1) for patients in the placebo group. Median overall survival was 8·8 months (95% CI 7·7-10·2) in the rilotumumab group compared with 10·7 months (9·6-12·4) in the placebo group (stratified hazard ratio 1·34, 95% CI 1·10-1·63; p=0·003). The most common grade 3 or worse adverse events in the rilotumumab and placebo groups were neutropenia (86 [29%] of 298 patients vs 97 [32%] of 299 patients), anaemia (37 [12%] vs 43 [14%]), and fatigue (30 [10%] vs 35 [12%]). The frequency of serious adverse events was similar in the rilotumumab and placebo groups (142 [48%] vs 149 [50%]). More deaths due to adverse events occurred in the rilotumumab group than the placebo group (42 [14%] vs 31 [10%]). In the rilotumumab group, 33 (11%) of 298 patients had fatal adverse events due to disease progression, and nine (3%) had fatal events not due to disease progression. In the placebo group, 23 (8%) of 299 patients had fatal adverse events due to disease progression, and eight (3%) had fatal events not due to disease progression. Ligand-blocking inhibition of the MET pathway with rilotumumab is not effective in improving clinical outcomes in patients with MET-positive gastric or gastro-oesophageal adenocarcinoma. Amgen.

Dysregulated hepatocyte growth factor/mesenchymal-epithelial transition (MET) signaling is associated with poor prognosis and resistance to vascular endothelial growth factor inhibition in metastatic colorectal cancer (mCRC). We report outcomes from a double-blind, multicenter phase II trial of the MET inhibitor onartuzumab in combination with mFOLFOX-6 and bevacizumab for mCRC (GO27827; NCT01418222). Patients were randomized 1:1 to receive onartuzumab (10 mg/kg intravenously [IV]) or placebo plus mFOLFOX-6 and bevacizumab (5 mg/kg IV). Oxaliplatin was given for 8-12 cycles; other agents were continued until disease progression, unacceptable toxicity, or death. The primary endpoint was progression-free survival (PFS) in the intent-to-treat (ITT) and MET immunohistochemistry (IHC) expression-positive populations. Between September 2011 and November 2012, 194 patients were enrolled. In September 2013, an interim analysis recommended stopping onartuzumab treatment due to lack of efficacy. At the time of the final analysis in February 2014, no significant improvement in PFS was seen with onartuzumab versus placebo in either the ITT or MET IHC-positive populations. An improvement in PFS was noted in the MET IHC-negative population. Neither overall survival nor response rate was improved with onartuzumab. The incidence of fatigue, peripheral edema, and deep vein thrombosis was increased with onartuzumab relative to placebo. Onartuzumab combined with mFOLFOX-6 and bevacizumab did not significantly improve efficacy outcomes in either the ITT or MET IHC-positive populations. MET expression by IHC was not a predictive biomarker in this setting. <b><i>The Oncologist</i></b> 2017;22:264-271 IMPLICATIONS FOR PRACTICE: The addition of onartuzumab to mFOLFOX-6 plus bevacizumab did not improve outcomes in patients with previously untreated metastatic colorectal cancer in this randomized, phase II study. Although initial results with onartuzumab were promising, a number of phase II/III clinical trials have reported a lack of improvement in efficacy with onartuzumab combined with standard-of-care therapies in several tumor types. Furthermore, negative study data have been published for rilotumumab and ficlatuzumab, both of which block hepatocyte growth factor binding to the mesenchymal-epithelial transition (MET) receptor. MET immunohistochemistry was not a predictive biomarker. It remains to be seen if other biomarkers or small molecule inhibitors may be more appropriate for inhibiting this oncogenic pathway.

Rilotumumab is an investigational, fully human monoclonal antibody to hepatocyte growth factor. In a randomized phase II study, trends toward improved survival were observed with rilotumumab (7.5 or 15 mg/kg) plus epirubicin, cisplatin, and capecitabine (ECX) versus placebo plus ECX in gastric/gastroesophageal junction (GEJ) cancer patients, especially in MET-positive patients. Here, we quantitatively characterized the longitudinal exposure-response [tumor growth (TG) and overall survival (OS)] relationship for rilotumumab. Rilotumumab concentrations, tumor sizes, and survival time from the phase II study were pooled to develop a longitudinal exposure versus TG model and parametric OS model that explored predictive/prognostic/treatment effects (MET expression, rilotumumab exposure, relative tumor size). Model evaluation included visual predictive checks, nonparametric bootstrap, and normalized prediction distribution errors. Simulations were undertaken to predict the relationship between rilotumumab dose and OS. Rilotumumab exhibited linear time-independent pharmacokinetics not affected by MET expression. The TG model adequately described tumor size across arms. A Weibull distribution best described OS. Rilotumumab exposure and change in tumor size from baseline at week 24 were predictive of OS. MET-positive patients showed shorter survival and responded better to rilotumumab than MET-negative patients. Simulations predicted a median (95% confidence interval) HR of 0.38 (0.18-0.60) in MET-positive patients treated with 15 mg/kg rilotumumab Q3W. Rilotumumab plus ECX demonstrated concentration-dependent effects on OS, influenced by MET expression, and tumor size in gastric/GEJ cancer patients. These findings support the phase II testing of rilotumumab 15 mg/kg every 3 weeks in MET-positive gastric/GEJ cancer (RILOMET-1; NCT01697072).

Rilotumumab is an investigational, fully human, monoclonal antibody immunoglobulin G2 against hepatocyte growth factor (HGF) that blocks the binding of HGF to its receptor MET and has shown trends toward improved survival in a phase 2 clinical trial in gastric cancer. To characterize rilotumumab pharmacokinetics in patients with cancer and to identify factors affecting the pharmacokinetics, rilotumumab concentration data from seven clinical trials were analyzed with a nonlinear mixed-effect model. We found that rilotumumab exhibited linear and time-invariant kinetics over a dose range of 0.5-20 mg/kg. Typical systemic clearance and central volume of distribution were 0.184 L/day and 3.56 L, respectively. Body weight is the most significant covariate, and sex, cancer type, coadministration of chemotherapeutics, baseline plasma HGF and tumor MET levels, and renal and hepatic functions did not have an effect on rilotumumab pharmacokinetics. The concentration-time profiles for the rilotumumab clinical regimens were projected well with the model.

To evaluate the efficacy, safety, biomarkers, and pharmacokinetics of rilotumumab, a fully human, monoclonal antibody against hepatocyte growth factor (HGF)/scatter factor, combined with mitoxantrone and prednisone (MP) in patients with castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC). This double-blinded phase II study randomized (1:1:1) patients with progressive, taxane-refractory CRPC to receive MP (12 mg/m(2) i.v. day 1, 5 mg twice a day orally days 1-21, respectively) plus 15 mg/kg rilotumumab, 7.5 mg/kg rilotumumab, or placebo (i.v. day 1) every 3 weeks. The primary endpoint was overall survival (OS). One hundred and forty-four patients were randomized. Median OS was 12.2 versus 11.1 months [HR, 1.10; 80% confidence interval (CI), 0.82-1.48] in the combined rilotumumab versus control arms. Median progression-free survival was 3.0 versus 2.9 months (HR, 1.02; 80% CI, 0.79-1.31). Treatment appeared well tolerated with peripheral edema (24% vs. 8%) being more common with rilotumumab. A trend toward unfavorable OS was observed in patients with high tumor MET expression regardless of treatment. Soluble MET levels increased in all treatment arms. Total HGF levels increased in the rilotumumab arms. Rilotumumab showed linear pharmacokinetics when co-administered with MP. Rilotumumab plus MP had manageable toxicities and showed no efficacy improvements in this estimation study. High tumor MET expression may identify patients with CRPC with poorer prognosis.
