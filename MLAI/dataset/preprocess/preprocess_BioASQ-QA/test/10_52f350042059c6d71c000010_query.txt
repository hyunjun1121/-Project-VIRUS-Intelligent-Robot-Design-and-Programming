To estimate the maternal age-specific live birth prevalence (in the absence of prenatal diagnosis and selective termination) of trisomy 13 (Patau syndrome) and trisomy 18 (Edwards syndrome) and compare it with that of trisomy 21 (Down syndrome). Records of prenatal and postnatal diagnoses from seven UK regional congenital anomaly registers and two Australian registers covering 4.5 million births included 975 diagnoses of trisomy 13 and 2254 of trisomy 18. Prevalence at birth in the absence of prenatal diagnosis and selective termination was calculated by adjusting for prenatally diagnosed pregnancies that were terminated according to their likelihood of surviving to term. The live birth prevalence in the absence of prenatal screening and selective termination in England and Wales from 1997 to 2004 was 1.4 (95% CI: 1.2-1.6) per 10 000 births for trisomy 13 and 2.3 (95% CI: 2.1-2.5) for trisomy 18. It has increased since 1989-1996, by 13% for trisomy 13 and 25% for trisomy 18. These increases are consistent with those predicted due to increases in maternal age. This study provides the first estimates of maternal age-specific prevalence of trisomies 13 and 18 for women aged 16-45.

Whilst maternal age is an established risk factor for Patau syndrome (trisomy 13), Edwards syndrome (trisomy 18) and Down syndrome (trisomy 21), the aetiology and contribution of genetic and environmental factors remains unclear. We analysed for space-time clustering using high quality fully population-based data from a geographically defined region. The study included all cases of Patau, Edwards and Down syndrome, delivered during 1985-2003 and resident in the former Northern Region of England, including terminations of pregnancy for fetal anomaly. We applied the K-function test for space-time clustering with fixed thresholds of close in space and time using residential addresses at time of delivery. The Knox test was used to indicate the range over which the clustering effect occurred. Tests were repeated using nearest neighbour (NN) thresholds to adjust for variable population density. The study analysed 116 cases of Patau syndrome, 240 cases of Edwards syndrome and 1084 cases of Down syndrome. There was evidence of space-time clustering for Down syndrome (fixed threshold of close in space: P = 0.01, NN threshold: P = 0.02), but little or no clustering for Patau (P = 0.57, P = 0.19) or Edwards (P = 0.37, P = 0.06) syndromes. Clustering of Down syndrome was associated with cases from more densely populated areas and evidence of clustering persisted when cases were restricted to maternal age <40 years. The highly novel space-time clustering for Down syndrome suggests an aetiological role for transient environmental factors, such as infections.

To determine whether older paternal age increases the risk of fathering a pregnancy with Patau (trisomy 13), Edwards (trisomy 18), Klinefelter (XXY) or XYY syndrome. Case-control: cases with each of these syndromes were matched to four controls with Down syndrome from within the same congenital anomaly register and with maternal age within 6 months. Data from 22 EUROCAT congenital anomaly registers in 12 European countries. Diagnoses with observed or (for terminations) predicted year of birth from 1980 to 2005, comprising live births, fetal deaths with gestational age â‰¥ 20 weeks and terminations after prenatal diagnosis of the anomaly. Data include 374 cases of Patau syndrome, 929 of Edwards syndrome, 295 of Klinefelter syndrome, 28 of XYY syndrome and 5627 controls with Down syndrome. Odds ratio (OR) associated with a 10-year increase in paternal age for each anomaly was estimated using conditional logistic regression. Results were adjusted to take account of the estimated association of paternal age with Down syndrome (1.11; 95% CI 1.01 to 1.23). The OR for Patau syndrome was 1.10 (95% CI 0.83 to 1.45); for Edwards syndrome, 1.15 (0.96 to 1.38); for Klinefelter syndrome, 1.35 (1.02 to 1.79); and for XYY syndrome, 1.99 (0.75 to 5.26). There was a statistically significant increase in the odds of Klinefelter syndrome with increasing paternal age. The larger positive associations of Klinefelter and XYY syndromes with paternal age compared with Patau and Edwards syndromes are consistent with the greater percentage of these sex chromosome anomalies being of paternal origin.

To evaluate the efficiency of the second trimester screening for fetal chromosomal anomaly using maternal serum marker. 27,313 pregnant women with the gestational age of 15 - 20 weeks were selected by stratified combined with cluster sampling from 13 counties over Jiangsu province and 5 townships, towns, or subdistricts from 6 randomly selected cities from southern, central, and northern Jiangsu, totally 95 communities, between July 2002 and November 2006. Questionnaire survey was conducted. Body weight was taken. Ultrasonography was used to confirm the gestational age. Peripheral blood samples were collected to detect the maternal serum alpha-fetoprotein (AFP) and free beta human chorionic gonadotrophin (f-betaHCG). The risk values of Down syndrome and Edwards syndrome were calculated. The women at high risk of Down syndrome and Edwards syndrome for their fetuses were recommended to receive genetic counseling and amniocentesis. All babies were followed up until six months to four years of age after birth. 26,803 of the 27,313 women (98%) were screened. The average was 25.1, and 1.7% of them were over 35. Serum screening showed that 1,244 (5%) were Down syndrome positive and 105 (0.4%) were Edwards syndrome positive. The final pregnant outcomes showed that 20 cases presented chromosomal abnormalities, of which 9 cases suffered from Down syndrome, 5 cases Edwards syndrome, and 6 cases other chromosomal abnormalities. The detection rate of Down syndrome and Edwards syndrome were 56% and 80% respectively. Under good quality control high prenatal detection rate of fetal chromosomal abnormalities can be reached by screening of maternal serum AFP and f-betaHCG during the second pregnancy trimester. Good cost-effectiveness depends on the incidence of targeted birth defects.

Maternal serum triple marker screening (alpha-fetoprotein, human chorionic gonadotropin, and unconjugated estriol) can detect 60-70% of Down syndrome and 60% of Edwards syndrome. Previous studies have reported that positive serum screening is related to other fetal chromosomal abnormalities, pregnancy complications, and adverse outcomes. We determined the incidence and karyotype of chromosomal abnormalities in screen positive women and evaluated a relationship between chromosomal and ultrasonographic abnormalities. Of the 49,806 pregnant women between 15 and 23 weeks' gestational age who received prenatal serum screening with a cut-off value (a risk of 1:270 for Down and 1:100 for Edwards syndrome), 2,116 (4.2%) and 196 (0.4%) were screen positive for Down syndrome and for Edwards syndrome, respectively. Chromosomal analysis in amniotic fluid was performed for 1,893 (89.5%) of the Down positive and 140 (71.4%) of the Edwards positive pregnant women. Ultrasonographic examination was performed to detect fetal abnormalities. Eighty-three cases of chromosomal abnormalities including 40 trisomy 21 (2.1%) and 43 other chromosomal abnormalities (2.3%) were identified in the Down screen positive. Other chromosomal abnormalities included 9 numerical and 34 structural abnormalities. Ten cases of chromosomal abnormalities (9 trisomy 18 and 1 trisomy 9) were detected in the Edwards screen positive. Ultrasonographic abnormalities were found more frequently in the women who had chromosomal aberrations. These data suggest that 4.4% of the Down screen and 7.1% of the Edwards screen positive pregnancy have fetal chromosomal abnormalities. Positive Down screening results reflect a relatively high probability of other abnormalities except trisomy 21. Edwards screen positive group show a low frequency of other chromosomal abnormalities except trisomy 18. A simultaneous use of maternal serum screening and ultrasonograms could be useful for the diagnosis of fetal abnormalities.

Oesophageal atresia is a congenital defect of alimentary tract concerning the interruption of oesophagus with or without connection with the trachea. Its incidence is 1:3000-3500 of live-born. Associated anomalies including genetic disorders occur in 50% of patients. Edwards syndrome which is trisomy of chromosome 18 with poor prognosis. The incidence of Edwards syndrome is 1:5000 of live-born. About 5% of these children live more than 1 year. The aim of this article is a retrospective analysis of the course of treatment of newborn with oesophageal atresia and Edwards syndrome and making of therapeutic decision. The authors from different medical specializations: clinical genetics, paediatric surgery, paediatrics and neonatology, paediatric intensive care and palliative medicine, have undertaken a discussion regarding surgical treatment of children with oesophageal atresia and chromosomal, lethal syndrome.

Edwards syndrome (trisomy 18) occurs in 1: 8000 live births and is closely related to the mother's age. Most of the embryos and fetuses with trisomy of 18 chromosome pair undergo natural abortion. Change in number and structure of chromosomes usually takes place spontaneously. However, the incidence of chromosome mutations increases with the presence of mutagenic factors. One of the chemical mutagenic factors is benzopyrene - present in cigarette smoke. Prenatal cytogenetic diagnostic is used for detecting diseases and clinical syndromes conditioned by chromosome aberrations. To this date the "golden standard" of this diagnostic is the assessment of the fetus karyotype by means of analysis of chromosome banding pattern from amniotic fluid-derived cells. The aim of the study was the analysis of indications for genetic amniocenteses carried out in the last 5 years and in case of which trisomy of chromosome 18 (Edwards syndrome) was diagnosed. The analysis covered 1593 results of fetus karyotypes obtained from Cytogenetic Laboratory of the Central Gynecological-Obstetric Clinical Hospital in PoznaÅ„ over the last 5 years. The study procedure consisted in producing cell culture from amniotic fluid, appliance of appropriate color techniques and thorough microscopic analysis of chromosome banding pattern. As a result of the analysis it was discovered that in 1538 cases the karyotype was normal, and in 55 cases trisomy 18 was diagnosed, which constituted 3% of all cytogenetic tests. The highest number of trisomy 18 cases was noted in 2009 - 19 cases, which constitutes 5% of all tests. In 2010 and 2011 the results included respectively 2% and 3% of diagnosed trisomy 18 (Edwards syndrome). In the last 5 years normal results for karyotypes constituted 87%, in 10% cases other aberrations were diagnosed through cystogenetic tests, whereas 3% of the results have shown trisomy 18 (Edwards syndrome The most frequent indications for performing genetic amniocentesis, as a result of which trisomy 18 was diagnosed, were defects in ultrasound image, including fetal hydrops which constituted 27.3% of all indications. Malformation syndrome in fetus and hydramnion constituted only 9.1% of indications for cytogenetic tests where trisomy 18 was diagnosed. The highest incidence rate of trisomy 18 was diagnosed in fetuses of women aged between 30 and 34. These were followed by 29 fetuses with Edwards syndrome in mothers aged between 25 and 29.

An analysis of prenatal diagnostics efficiency of selected types of chromosomal aberrations in the Czech Republic in 2007. Update of 1994-2007 data according to particular selected diagnoses. Retrospective epidemiological analysis of pre- and postnatal chromosomal aberrations diagnostics and its efficiency. Data on pre- and postnatally diagnosed birth defects in the Czech Republic during 1994-2007 were used. Data on prenatally diagnosed birth defects (and for terminated pregnancies) were collected from particular departments of prenatal diagnostics, medical genetics and ultrasound diagnostics in the Czech Republic, data on birth defects in births from the National Birth Defects Register (Institute for Health Information and Statistics). Total numbers over the period under the study, mean incidences of selected types of chromosomal aberrations and mean prenatal diagnostics efficiencies were analyzed. Following chromosomal aberrations were studied: Down, Edwards, Patau, Turner and Klinefelter syndromes and syndromes 47,XXX and 47,XYY. A relative proportion of Down, Edwards and Patau syndromes as well as other autosomal and gonosomal aberration is presented in figures. Recently, trisomies 13, 18 and 21 present around 70% of all chromosomal aberrations in selectively aborted fetuses, in other pregnancies, "other chromosomal aberrations" category (mostly balanced reciprocal translocations and inversions) present more than 2/3 of all diagnoses. During the period under the study, following total numbers, mean relative incidences (per 10,000 live births, in brackets) and mean prenatal diagnostics efficiency (in %) were found in following chromosomal syndromes: Down syndrome 2,244 (16.58) and 63.37%, Edwards syndrome 521 (3.85) and 79.93%, Patau syndrome 201 (1.49) and 68.87%, Turner syndrome 380 (2.81) and 79.89%, 47,XXX syndrome 61 (0.45) and 59.74%, Klinefelter syndrome 163 (1.20) and 73.65% and 47,XYY syndrome 22 (0.16) and 54.76%. The study gives updated results of incidences analysis of both pre- and postnatally diagnosed chromosomal birth defects in the Czech Republic during the 1994-2007 period. Incidences found in our study correspond (in case of trisomies 13, 18 and 21) with those published widely in literature as well as with those found in large-scale international studies (ICBDSR, EUROCAT). In case of gonosomal aberrations, incidences found in this study are lower that those published, most probably due to a later registration (over 15 years of age of the child) of these diagnoses.

To assess the efficacy of the prenatal screening and diagnostic programme for the detection of the common autosomal trisomies in the North West Thames region prior to the introduction of serum screening. A retrospective study based on reports made to the North West Thames Regional Health Authority Congenital Malformation Register. 235 pregnancies of women delivered in units in the North West Thames region over a two-year period (1990-91) whose babies or fetuses were diagnosed as having Down, Edwards or Patau syndrome. 33% of Down syndrome, 68% of Edwards syndrome and 52% of Patau syndrome were diagnosed prenatally (before 28 weeks) in the region without the use of serum screening. Using maternal age and routine ultrasound as screening methods, units in the region are prenatally diagnosing significantly fewer Down syndrome babies than are those in authorities using serum screening. The use of maternal age and ultrasound screening is more effective for the antenatal detection of the other autosomal trisomies than it is for the detection of Down syndrome. It is not yet clear to what extent serum screening might be expected to increase the detection rate for these conditions.

An analysis of incidences of selected birth defects in the Czech Republic in 2000 - 2008 period. Retrospective epidemiological analysis of birth defects incidences in births and total birth defects incidences (including prenatally diagnosed cases) from the Czech National Birth Defects Register database. Data from the National Birth Defects Register (Institute for Health Information and Statistics) in the Czech Republic in the 2000 - 2008 period were used along with data on prenatally diagnosed defects from particular departments of medical genetics. Sixteen selected defects (anencephaly, spina bifida, encephalocele, congenital hydrocephalus, coarctation of aorta, transposition of great vessels, hypoplastic left heart syndrome, Fallot tetralogy, omphalocele, gastroschisis, diaphragmatic hernia, oesophageal atresia and stenosis, anorectal malformations, Down syndrome, Edwards syndrome and Patau syndrome) were analyzed in detail. There were 119 570 live births (61 326 boys and 58 244 girls) in 2008. In the same period, 4664 live births with a birth defect (under the age of one year) were reported, out of which 2754 boys and 1910 girls. Mean incidence was 390.06 (449.08 in boys and 327.93 in girls) per 10 000 live births. In 1994 - 2006, totally 1 238 398 children were born, out of which more than 42 000 with a birth defect. In the 2000 - 2006 period, absolute numbers of diagnosed live births with birth defect varied between 3600 - 3800 cases per year while in 2007 and 2008 years absolute numbers raised over 4600 cases per year. During 2000 - 2008 period following mean incidences (per 10 000 live births) of selected defects were ascertained (total incidences including prenatal diagnostics in brackets): anencephaly 0 - 0.3 (1.9 - 3.7), spina bifida 0.7 - 2.3 (3.2 - 5.2), encephalocele 0.1 - 0.4 (0.9 - 2.4), congenital hydrocephalus 1.6 - 3.5 (5.3 - 7.0), coarctation of aorta 3.9 - 5.2 (4.8 - 6.1), transposition of great vessels 2.9 - 4.5 (3.2 - 5.0), hypoplastic left heart syndrome 0.7 - 2.3 (2.2 - 4.3), Fallot tetralogy 2.6 - 4.0 (3.2 - 4.4), omphalocele 1.0 - 1.7 (1.8 - 3.8), gastroschisis 0.2 - 1.2 (2.4 - 3.4), diaphragmatic hernia 1.3 - 2.9 (1.5 - 3.9), Down syndrome 3.3 - 6.5 (15.8 - 22.2), Edwards syndrome 0.2 - 1.0 (3.5 - 5.8) and Patau syndrome 0.2 - 1.0 (1.2 - 2.6). There has been no major change in birth defect incidences in live births in the Czech Republic in last years. Number of non-viable defects has decreased in stillbirths and in perinatal mortality in the Czech Republic. An incidence of some defects has decreased mostly due to a nation-wide system of prenatal diagnostics; some incidences remain stable in live-birth population in others incidences have increased. A total incidence has mostly increased (anencephaly being an exception) mostly due to an earlier prenatal diagnostics. In chromosomal syndromes, an increasing maternal age as well as a growing number of mothers of 35 years of age and over has contributed to the increased incidences.
