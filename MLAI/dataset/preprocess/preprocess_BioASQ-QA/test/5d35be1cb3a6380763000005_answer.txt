IDEAL_ANSWER:
- Human Wapl is a cohesin-binding protein that promotes sister-chromatid resolution in mitotic prophase We show that the human ortholog of Wapl is a cohesin-binding protein that facilitates cohesin's timely release from chromosome arms during prophase.
- Wapl is a cohesin-binding protein that facilitates cohesin's timely release from chromosome arms during prophase.It promotes the release of cohesin from chromosomes during both interphase and mitosis.
- Human Wapl is a cohesin-binding protein that promotes sister-chromatid resolution in mitotic prophase. We show that the human ortholog of Wapl is a cohesin-binding protein that facilitates cohesin's timely release from chromosome arms during prophase.

EXACT_ANSWER:
