What organism causes woolsorter's disease

[PMID: 18959192]
Focusing on three Anglo-American outbreaks of industrial anthrax, this essay engages the question of how local circumstances influenced the transmission of scientific knowledge in the late nineteenth century. Walpole (Massachusetts), Glasgow, and Bradford (Yorkshire) served as important nodes of transnational investigation into anthrax. Knowledge about the morphology and behavior of Bacillus anthracis changed little while in transit between these nodes, even during complex debates about the nature of bacterial morphology, disease causation, and spontaneous generation. Working independently of their more famous counterparts (Robert Koch and Louis Pasteur), Anglo-American anthrax investigators used visual representations of anthrax bacilli to persuade their peers that a specific, identifiable cause produced all forms of anthrax-malignant pustule (cutaneous anthrax), intestinal anthrax, and woolsorter's disease (pneumonic anthrax). By the late 1870s, this point of view also supported what we would today call an ecological notion of the disease's origins in the interactions of people, animals, and microorganisms in the context of global commerce.

Woolsorters' disease was a feared industrial disease associated primarily with Yorkshire's textile industry of the nineteenth and early twentieth centuries. Early occupational health methods were attempted locally before concerted national efforts produced legislative measures. When its link with anthrax was established, attention in prevention focused upon chemical disinfection methods. Together, these factors were instrumental in decreasing the incidence of woolsorters' disease. However, by the beginning of the Second World War, the lack of treatment options for anthrax meant that the bacterium was experimented upon as a potential war-winning weapon. Today, woolsorters' disease and other industrial manifestations of anthrax are extremely rare, but the increasing threat of bioterrorism means that the international dread and historical lessons of this significant condition should never be forgotten. Consequently, this paper reveals the history of woolsorters' disease in order to remind those involved in occupational medicine today of the dread it caused both physicians and workers in previous generations.
