What cellular process are okazaki fragments associated with?

Processing of Okazaki fragments to complete lagging strand DNA synthesis requires coordination among several proteins. RNA primers and DNA synthesised by DNA polymerase α are displaced by DNA polymerase δ to create bifurcated nucleic acid structures known as 5'-flaps. These 5'-flaps are removed by Flap Endonuclease 1 (FEN), a structure-specific nuclease whose divalent metal ion-dependent phosphodiesterase activity cleaves 5'-flaps with exquisite specificity. FENs are paradigms for the 5' nuclease superfamily, whose members perform a wide variety of roles in nucleic acid metabolism using a similar nuclease core domain that displays common biochemical properties and structural features. A detailed review of FEN structure is undertaken to show how DNA substrate recognition occurs and how FEN achieves cleavage at a single phosphate diester. A proposed double nucleotide unpairing trap (DoNUT) is discussed with regards to FEN and has relevance to the wider 5' nuclease superfamily. The homotrimeric proliferating cell nuclear antigen protein (PCNA) coordinates the actions of DNA polymerase, FEN and DNA ligase by facilitating the hand-off intermediates between each protein during Okazaki fragment maturation to maximise through-put and minimise consequences of intermediates being released into the wider cellular environment. FEN has numerous partner proteins that modulate and control its action during DNA replication and is also controlled by several post-translational modification events, all acting in concert to maintain precise and appropriate cleavage of Okazaki fragment intermediates during DNA replication.

Essentially all of the Okazaki fragments on replicating Simian virus 40 (SV40)DNA could be grouped into one of three classes. Class I Okazaki fragments (about 20%) were separated from longer nascent DNA chains by a single phosphodiester bond interruption (nick) and were quantitatively identified by treating purified replicating DNA with Escherichia coli DNA ligase and then measuring the fraction of Okazaki fragments joined to longer nascent DNA chains. Similarly, class II Okazaki fragments (about 30%) were separated by a region of single-stranded DNA template (gap) that could be filled and sealed by T4 DNA polymerase plus E. coli DNA ligase, and class III fragments (about 50%) were separated by RNA primers that could be removed with E. coli DNA olymerase I, allowing the fragments to be joined with E. coli DNA ligase. These results were obtained with replicating SV40 DNA that had been briefly labeled with radioactive precursors in either intact cells or isolated nuclei. When isolated nuclei were further incubated in the presence of cytosol, all of the Okazaki fragments were converted into longer DNA strands as expected for intermediates in DNA synthesis. However, when washed nuclei were incubated in the abscence of cytosol, both class I and class II Okazaki fragments accumulated despite the excision of RNA primers: class III Okazaki fragments and RNA-DNA covalent linkages both disappeared at similar rates. These data demonstrate the existence of RNA primers in whole cells as well as in isolated nuclei, and identify a unique gap-filling step that is not simply an extension of the DNA chain elongation process concomitant with the excision of RNA primers. One or more factos found in cytosol, in addition to DNA polymerase alpha, are specifically involved in the gap-filling and ligation steps. The sizes of mature Okazaki fragments (class I) and Okazaki fragments whose synthesis was completed by T4 DNA polymerase were measured by gel electrophoresis and found to be broadly distributed between 40 and 290 nucleotides with an average length of 135 nucleotides. Since 80% and 90% of the Okazaments does not occur at uniformly spaced intervals along the DNA template. During the excision of RNA primers, nascent DNA chains with a single ribonucleotide covalently attached to the 5' terminus were identified as transient intermediates. These intermediates accumulated during excision of RNA primers in the presence of adenine 9-beta-D-arabinoside 5'-triphosphate, and those Okazaki fragments blocked by RNA primers (class III) were found to have originated the farthest from the 5' ends of long nascent DNA strands. Thus, RNA primers appear to be excised in two steps with the second step, removal of the final ribonucleotide, being stimulated by concomitant DNA synthesis. These and other data were used to construct a comprehensive metabolic pathway for the initiation, elongation, and maturation of Okazaki fragments at mammalian DNA replication forks.

Flap endonuclease 1 (FEN1) has been shown to remove 5' overhanging flap intermediates during base excision repair and to process the 5' ends of Okazaki fragments during lagging-strand DNA replication in vitro. To assess the in vivo role of the mammalian enzyme in repair and replication, we used a gene-targeting approach to generate mice lacking a functional Fen1 gene. Heterozygote animals appear normal, whereas complete depletion of FEN1 causes early embryonic lethality. Fen1(-/-) blastocysts fail to form inner cell mass during cellular outgrowth, and a complete inactivation of DNA synthesis in giant cells of blastocyst outgrowth was observed. Exposure of Fen1(-/-) blastocysts to gamma radiation caused extensive apoptosis, implying an essential role for FEN1 in the repair of radiation-induced DNA damage in vivo. Our data thus provide in vivo evidence for an essential function of FEN1 in DNA repair, as well as in DNA replication.

FENs (flap endonucleases) play essential roles in DNA replication, pivotally in the resolution of Okazaki fragments. In eubacteria, DNA PolI (polymerase I) contains a flap processing domain, the N-terminal 5'-->3' exonuclease. We present evidence of paralogous FEN-encoding genes present in many eubacteria. Two distinct classes of these independent FEN-encoding genes exist with four groups of eubacteria, being identified based on the number and type of FEN gene encoded. The respective proteins possess distinct motifs hallmarking their differentiation. Crucially, based on primary sequence and predicted secondary structural motifs, we reveal key differences at their active sites. These results are supported by biochemical characterization of two family members--ExoIX (exonuclease IX) from Escherichia coli and SaFEN (Staphylococcus aureus FEN). These proteins displayed marked differences in their ability to process a range of branched and linear DNA structures. On bifurcated substrates, SaFEN exhibited similar substrate specificity to previously characterized FENs. In quantitative exonuclease assays, SaFEN maintained a comparable activity with that reported for PolI. However, ExoIX showed no observable enzymatic activity. A threaded model is presented for SaFEN, demonstrating the probable interaction of this newly identified class of FEN with divalent metal ions and a branched DNA substrate. The results from the present study provide an intriguing model for the cellular role of these FEN sub-classes and illustrate the evolutionary importance of processing aberrant DNA, which has led to their maintenance alongside DNA PolI in many eubacteria.

Lagging strand DNA replication requires the concerted actions of DNA polymerase δ, Fen1 and DNA ligase I for the removal of the RNA/DNA primers before ligation of Okazaki fragments. To better understand this process in human cells, we have reconstituted Okazaki fragment processing by the short flap pathway in vitro with purified human proteins and oligonucleotide substrates. We systematically characterized the key events in Okazaki fragment processing: the strand displacement, Pol δ/Fen1 combined reactions for removal of the RNA/DNA primer, and the complete reaction with DNA ligase I. Two forms of human DNA polymerase δ were studied: Pol δ4 and Pol δ3, which represent the heterotetramer and the heterotrimer lacking the p12 subunit, respectively. Pol δ3 exhibits very limited strand displacement activity in contrast to Pol δ4, and stalls on encounter with a 5'-blocking oligonucleotide. Pol δ4 and Pol δ3 exhibit different characteristics in the Pol δ/Fen1 reactions. While Pol δ3 produces predominantly 1 and 2 nt cleavage products irrespective of Fen1 concentrations, Pol δ4 produces cleavage fragments of 1-10 nts at low Fen1 concentrations. Pol δ3 and Pol δ4 exhibit comparable formation of ligated products in the complete system. While both are capable of Okazaki fragment processing in vitro, Pol δ3 exhibits ideal characteristics for a role in Okazaki fragment processing. Pol δ3 readily idles and in combination with Fen1 produces primarily 1 nt cleavage products, so that nick translation predominates in the removal of the blocking strand, avoiding the production of longer flaps that require additional processing. These studies represent the first analysis of the two forms of human Pol δ in Okazaki fragment processing. The findings provide evidence for the novel concept that Pol δ3 has a role in lagging strand synthesis, and that both forms of Pol δ may participate in DNA replication in higher eukaryotic cells.

Cytarabine is a potent anticancer drug that interferes with elongation of the lagging strand at the replication fork during DNA synthesis. The effects of cytarabine substitution on the structural and thermodynamic properties of a model Okazaki fragment were investigated using UV hyperchromicity and 1H NMR spectroscopy to determine how cytarabine alters the physicochemical properties of Okazaki fragments that are intermediates during DNA replication. Two model Okazaki fragments were prepared corresponding to a primary initiation site for DNA replication in the SV40 viral genome. One model Okazaki fragment consisted of five ribo- and seven deoxyribonucleotides on the hybrid strand, together with its complementary (DNA) strand. The second model Okazaki fragment was identical to the first with the exception of cytarabine substitution for deoxycytidine at the third DNA nucleotide of the hybrid strand. Thermodynamic parameters for the duplex to single strand transition for each model Okazaki fragment were calculated from the concentration dependence of the T m at 260 nm. Cytarabine significantly decreased the stability of this model Okazaki fragment, decreasing the melting temperature from 46.8 to 42.4 degrees C at a concentration of 1.33 x 10(-5) M. The free energy for the duplex to single strand transition was 1.2 kcal/mol less favorable for the cytarabine-substituted Okazaki fragment relative to the control at 37 degrees C. Analysis of the temperature dependence of the imino1H resonances for the two duplexes demonstrated that cytarabine specifically destabilized the DNA:DNA duplex portion of the model Okazaki fragment. These results are consistent with inhibition of lagging strand DNA synthesis by cytarabine substitution resulting from destabilization of the DNA:DNA duplex portion of Okazaki fragments in vivo .

During DNA replication, repetitive synthesis of discrete Okazaki fragments requires mechanisms that guarantee DNA polymerase, clamp, and primase proteins are present for every cycle. In Escherichia coli, this process proceeds through transfer of the lagging-strand polymerase from the β sliding clamp left at a completed Okazaki fragment to a clamp assembled on a new RNA primer. These lagging-strand clamps are thought to be bound by the replisome from solution and loaded a new for every fragment. Here, we discuss a surprising, alternative lagging-strand synthesis mechanism: efficient replication in the absence of any clamps other than those assembled with the replisome. Using single-molecule experiments, we show that replication complexes pre-assembled on DNA support synthesis of multiple Okazaki fragments in the absence of excess β clamps. The processivity of these replisomes, but not the number of synthesized Okazaki fragments, is dependent on the frequency of RNA-primer synthesis. These results broaden our understanding of lagging-strand synthesis and emphasize the stability of the replisome to continue synthesis without new clamps.

DNA polymerase alpha (pol alpha) holds a special position among the growing family of eukaryotic DNA polymerases. In fact, pol alpha is associated with DNA primase to form a four subunit complex and, as a consequence, is the only enzyme able to start DNA synthesis de novo. Because of this peculiarity the major role of the DNA polymerase alpha-primase complex (pol-prim) is in the initiation of DNA replication at chromosomal origins and in the discontinuous synthesis of Okazaki fragments on the lagging strand of the replication fork. However, pol-prim seems to play additional roles in other complex cellular processes, such as the response to DNA damage, telomere maintenance, and the epigenetic control of higher order chromatin assembly.

Completion of lagging strand DNA synthesis requires processing of up to 50 million Okazaki fragments per cell cycle in mammalian cells. Even in yeast, the Okazaki fragment maturation happens approximately a million times during a single round of DNA replication. Therefore, efficient processing of Okazaki fragments is vital for DNA replication and cell proliferation. During this process, primase-synthesized RNA/DNA primers are removed, and Okazaki fragments are joined into an intact lagging strand DNA. The processing of RNA/DNA primers requires a group of structure-specific nucleases typified by flap endonuclease 1 (FEN1). Here, we summarize the distinct roles of these nucleases in different pathways for removal of RNA/DNA primers. Recent findings reveal that Okazaki fragment maturation is highly coordinated. The dynamic interactions of polymerase δ, FEN1 and DNA ligase I with proliferating cell nuclear antigen allow these enzymes to act sequentially during Okazaki fragment maturation. Such protein-protein interactions may be regulated by post-translational modifications. We also discuss studies using mutant mouse models that suggest two distinct cancer etiological mechanisms arising from defects in different steps of Okazaki fragment maturation. Mutations that affect the efficiency of RNA primer removal may result in accumulation of unligated nicks and DNA double-strand breaks. These DNA strand breaks can cause varying forms of chromosome aberrations, contributing to development of cancer that associates with aneuploidy and gross chromosomal rearrangement. On the other hand, mutations that impair editing out of polymerase α incorporation errors result in cancer displaying a strong mutator phenotype.

Eukaryotic chromosomal DNA is faithfully replicated in a complex series of cell-cycle-regulated events that are incompletely understood. Here we report the reconstitution of DNA replication free in solution with purified proteins from the budding yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae. The system recapitulates regulated bidirectional origin activation; synthesis of leading and lagging strands by the three replicative DNA polymerases Pol α, Pol δ, and Pol ε; and canonical maturation of Okazaki fragments into continuous daughter strands. We uncover a dual regulatory role for chromatin during DNA replication: promoting origin dependence and determining Okazaki fragment length by restricting Pol δ progression. This system thus provides a functional platform for the detailed mechanistic analysis of eukaryotic chromosome replication.

An initiator RNA (iRNA) is required to prime cellular DNA synthesis. The structure of double-stranded DNA allows the synthesis of one strand to be continuous but the other must be generated discontinuously. Frequent priming of the discontinuous strand results in the formation of many small segments, designated Okazaki fragments. These short pieces need to be processed and joined to form an intact DNA strand. Our knowledge of the mechanism of iRNA removal is still evolving. Early reconstituted systems suggesting that the removal of iRNA requires sequential action of RNase H and flap endonuclease 1 (FEN1) led to the RNase H/FEN1 model. However, genetic analyses implied that Dna2p, an essential helicase/nuclease, is required. Subsequent biochemical studies suggested sequential action of RPA, Dna2p, and FEN1 for iRNA removal, leading to the second model, the Dna2p/RPA/FEN1 model. Studies of strand-displacement synthesis by polymerase delta indicated that in a reconstituted system, FEN1 could act as soon as short flaps are created, giving rise to a third model, the FEN1-only model. Each of the three pathways is supported by different genetic and biochemical results. Properties of the major protein components in this process will be discussed, and the validity of each model as a true representation of Okazaki fragment processing will be critically evaluated in this review.

During replication, Okazaki fragment maturation is a fundamental process that joins discontinuously synthesized DNA fragments into a contiguous lagging strand. Efficient maturation prevents repeat sequence expansions, small duplications, and generation of double-stranded DNA breaks. To address the components required for the process in Thermococcus, Okazaki fragment maturation was reconstituted in vitro using purified proteins from Thermococcus species 9°N or cell extracts. A dual color fluorescence assay was developed to monitor reaction substrates, intermediates, and products. DNA polymerase D (polD) was proposed to function as the replicative polymerase in Thermococcus replicating both the leading and the lagging strands. It is shown here, however, that it stops before the previous Okazaki fragments, failing to rapidly process them. Instead, Family B DNA polymerase (polB) was observed to rapidly fill the gaps left by polD and displaces the downstream Okazaki fragment to create a flap structure. This flap structure was cleaved by flap endonuclease 1 (Fen1) and the resultant nick was ligated by DNA ligase to form a mature lagging strand. The similarities to both bacterial and eukaryotic systems and evolutionary implications of archaeal Okazaki fragment maturation are discussed.

DNA replication is a primary mechanism for maintaining genome integrity, but it serves this purpose best by cooperating with other proteins involved in DNA repair and recombination. Unlike leading strand synthesis, lagging strand synthesis has a greater risk of faulty replication for several reasons: First, a significant part of DNA is synthesized by polymerase alpha, which lacks a proofreading function. Second, a great number of Okazaki fragments are synthesized, processed and ligated per cell division. Third, the principal mechanism of Okazaki fragment processing is via generation of flaps, which have the potential to form a variety of structures in their sequence context. Finally, many proteins for the lagging strand interact with factors involved in repair and recombination. Thus, lagging strand DNA synthesis could be the best example of a converging place of both replication and repair proteins. To achieve the risky task with extraordinary fidelity, Okazaki fragment processing may depend on multiple layers of redundant, but connected pathways. An essential Dna2 endonuclease/helicase plays a pivotal role in processing common structural intermediates that occur during diverse DNA metabolisms (e.g. lagging strand synthesis and telomere maintenance). Many roles of Dna2 suggest that the preemptive removal of long or structured flaps ultimately contributes to genome maintenance in eukaryotes. In this review, we describe the function of Dna2 in Okazaki fragment processing, and discuss its role in the maintenance of genome integrity with an emphasis on its functional interactions with other factors required for genome maintenance.

During DNA replication, synthesis of the lagging strand occurs in stretches termed Okazaki fragments. Before adjacent fragments are ligated, any flaps resulting from the displacement of the 5' DNA end of the Okazaki fragment must be cleaved. Previously, Dna2 was implicated to function upstream of flap endonuclease 1 (Fen1 or Rad27) in the processing of long flaps bound by the replication protein A (RPA). Here we show that Dna2 efficiently cleaves long DNA flaps exactly at or directly adjacent to the base. A fraction of the flaps cleaved by Dna2 can be immediately ligated. When coupled with DNA replication, the flap processing activity of Dna2 leads to a nearly complete Okazaki fragment maturation at sub-nanomolar Dna2 concentrations. Our results indicate that a subsequent nucleolytic activity of Fen1 is not required in most cases. In contrast Dna2 is completely incapable to cleave short flaps. We show that also Dna2, like Fen1, interacts with proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA). We propose a model where Dna2 alone is responsible for cleaving of RPA-bound long flaps, while Fen1 or exonuclease 1 (Exo1) cleave short flaps. Our results argue that Dna2 can function in a separate, rather than in a Fen1-dependent pathway.

This review focuses on the biogenesis and composition of the eukaryotic DNA replication fork, with an emphasis on the enzymes that synthesize DNA and repair discontinuities on the lagging strand of the replication fork. Physical and genetic methodologies aimed at understanding these processes are discussed. The preponderance of evidence supports a model in which DNA polymerase ε (Pol ε) carries out the bulk of leading strand DNA synthesis at an undisturbed replication fork. DNA polymerases α and δ carry out the initiation of Okazaki fragment synthesis and its elongation and maturation, respectively. This review also discusses alternative proposals, including cellular processes during which alternative forks may be utilized, and new biochemical studies with purified proteins that are aimed at reconstituting leading and lagging strand DNA synthesis separately and as an integrated replication fork.

Eukaryotic DNA replication is a complex process requiring the proper functioning of a multitude of proteins to create error-free daughter DNA strands and maintain genome integrity. Even though synthesis and joining of Okazaki fragments on the lagging strand involves only half the DNA in the nucleus, the complexity associated with processing these fragments is about twice that needed for leading strand synthesis. Flap endonuclease 1 (FEN1) is the central component of the Okazaki fragment maturation pathway. FEN1 cleaves flaps that are displaced by DNA polymerase delta (pol delta), to create a nick that is effectively joined by DNA ligase I. The Pif1 helicase and Dna2 helicase/nuclease contribute to the maturation process by elongating the flap displaced by pol delta. Though the reason for generating long flaps is still a matter of debate, genetic studies have shown that Dna2 and Pif1 are both important components of DNA replication. Our current knowledge of the exact enzymatic steps that govern Okazaki fragment maturation has heavily derived from reconstitution reactions in vitro, which have augmented genetic information, to yield current mechanistic models. In this review, we describe both the design of specific DNA substrates that simulate intermediates of fragment maturation and protocols for reconstituting partial and complete lagging strand replication.

DNA replication is one of the most important events in living cells, and it is still a key problem how the DNA replication machinery works in its details. A replication fork has to be a very dynamic apparatus since frequent DNA polymerase switches from the initiating DNA polymerase alpha to the processive elongating DNA polymerase delta occur at the leading strand (about 8 x 10(4) fold on both strands in one replication round) as well as at the lagging strand (about 2 x 10(7) fold on both strands in one replication round) in mammalian cells. Lagging strand replication involves a very complex set of interacting proteins that are able to frequently initiate, elongate and process Okazaki fragments of 180 bp. Moreover, key proteins of this important process appear to be controlled by S-phase check-point proteins. It became furthermore clear in the last few years that DNA replication cannot be considered uncoupled from DNA repair, another very important event for any living organism. The reconstitution of nucleotide excision repair and base excision repair in vitro with purified components clearly showed that the DNA synthesis machinery of both of these macromolecular events are similar and do share many components of the lagging strand DNA synthesis machinery. In this minireview we summarize our current knowledge of the components involved in the execution and regulation of DNA replication at the lagging strand of the replication fork.

Fifty per cent of the genome is discontinuously replicated on the lagging strand as Okazaki fragments. Eukaryotic Okazaki fragments remain poorly characterized and, because nucleosomes are rapidly deposited on nascent DNA, Okazaki fragment processing and nucleosome assembly potentially affect one another. Here we show that ligation-competent Okazaki fragments in Saccharomyces cerevisiae are sized according to the nucleosome repeat. Using deep sequencing, we demonstrate that ligation junctions preferentially occur near nucleosome midpoints rather than in internucleosomal linker regions. Disrupting chromatin assembly or lagging-strand polymerase processivity affects both the size and the distribution of Okazaki fragments, suggesting a role for nascent chromatin, assembled immediately after the passage of the replication fork, in the termination of Okazaki fragment synthesis. Our studies represent the first high-resolution analysis--to our knowledge--of eukaryotic Okazaki fragments in vivo, and reveal the interconnection between lagging-strand synthesis and chromatin assembly.

Genome-wide Okazaki fragment distribution can differentiate the discontinuous from the semi-discontinuous DNA replication model. Here, we investigated the genome-wide Okazaki fragment distribution in Saccharomyces cerevisiae S288C. We improved the method based upon lambda exonuclease digestion to purify Okazaki fragments from S288C yeast cells, followed by Illumina sequencing. The distribution of Okazaki fragments around confirmed replication origins, including two highly efficient replication origins, supported the discontinuous DNA replication model. In S. cerevisiae mitochondria, Okazaki fragments were overrepresented in the transcribed regions, indicating the interplay between transcription and DNA replication.

During DNA replication in eukaryotic cells, short single-stranded DNA segments known as Okazaki fragments are first synthesized on the lagging strand. The Okazaki fragments originate from ∼35-nucleotide-long RNA-DNA primers. After Okazaki fragment synthesis, these primers must be removed to allow fragment joining into a continuous lagging strand. To date, the models of enzymatic machinery that removes the RNA-DNA primers have come almost exclusively from biochemical reconstitution studies and some genetic interaction assays, and there is little direct evidence to confirm these models. One obstacle to elucidating Okazaki fragment processing has been the lack of methods that can directly examine primer removal <i>in vivo</i> In this study, we developed an electron microscopy assay that can visualize nucleotide flap structures on DNA replication forks in fission yeast (<i>Schizosaccharomyces pombe</i>). With this assay, we first demonstrated the generation of flap structures during Okazaki fragment processing <i>in vivo</i> The mean and median lengths of the flaps in wild-type cells were ∼51 and ∼41 nucleotides, respectively. We also used yeast mutants to investigate the impact of deleting key DNA replication nucleases on these flap structures. Our results provided direct <i>in vivo</i> evidence for a previously proposed flap cleavage pathway and the critical function of Dna2 and Fen1 in cleaving these flaps. In addition, we found evidence for another previously proposed exonucleolytic pathway involving RNA-DNA primer digestion by exonucleases RNase H2 and Exo1. Taken together, our observations suggest a dual mechanism for Okazaki fragment maturation in lagging strand synthesis and establish a new strategy for interrogation of this fascinating process.

We have previously demonstrated that lagging-strand synthesis in budding yeast is coupled with chromatin assembly on newly synthesized DNA. Using a strain of S. cerevisiae in which DNA ligase I can be conditionally depleted, we can enrich and purify Okazaki fragments. We delineate a method to extract, end label, and visualize Okazaki fragments using denaturing agarose gel electrophoresis. Furthermore, we describe an ion-exchange chromatographic method for purification of fragments and preparation of strand-specific sequencing libraries. Deep sequencing of Okazaki fragments generates a comprehensive, genomic map of DNA synthesis, starting from a single asynchronous culture. Altogether this approach represents a tractable system to investigate key aspects of DNA replication and chromatin assembly.

At DNA replication forks, the overall growth of the antiparallel two daughter DNA chains appears to occur 5'-to-3' direction in the leading-strand and 3'-to-5' direction in the lagging-strand using enzyme system only able to elongate 5'-to-3' direction, and I describe in this review how we have analyzed and proved the lagging strand multistep synthesis reactions, called Discontinuous Replication Mechanism, which involve short RNA primer synthesis, primer-dependent short DNA chains (Okazaki fragments) synthesis, primer removal from the Okazaki fragments and gap filling between Okazaki fragments by RNase H and DNA polymerase I, and long lagging strand formation by joining between Okazaki fragments with DNA ligase.

[PMID: 12228807]
RNA primer removal from Okazaki fragments during lagging-strand replication and the excision of damaged DNA bases requires the action of structure-specific nucleases, such as the mammalian flap endonuclease 1 (FEN-1). This nuclease contains two conserved motifs enriched with acidic amino acid residues that are important for catalytic function. Similar motifs have been identified in nucleases found in viruses, archebacteria, eubacteria, and in eukaryotes ranging from yeast to humans. Unique among these proteins, the putative FEN-1 homologue in Escherichia coli is contained within the N-terminal region of the DNA polymerase I (PolN). To demonstrate that the cellular functions of FEN-1 reside in PolN, we cloned and expressed the amino terminal domain (323 amino acid residues) of PolI in a Saccharomyces cerevisiae strain lacking the FEN-1 homologue RAD27. Overexpression of PolN suppressed, to varying degrees, phenotypes associated with a rad27 null strain. These include temperature sensitivity, Okazaki fragment processing, a mutator phenotype, a G2/M cell cycle arrest, minichromosome loss, and methyl methane sulfonate sensitivity. We purified Rad27 and PolN proteins in order to determine whether differences in their intrinsic nuclease activities or interaction with proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA) could explain the partial suppression of some phenotypes. We found that the in vitro nuclease activities of Rad27 were more potent than those of PolN and the activity of Rad27, but not PolN, was stimulated by PCNA. We conclude that the N-terminal nuclease domain of E. coli polymerase I encodes a functional homologue of FEN-1.

High-fidelity DNA replication depends on both accurate incorporation of nucleotides in the newly synthesized strand and the maturation of Okazaki fragments. In eukaryotic cells, the latter is accomplished by a series of coordinated actions of a set of structure-specific nucleases, which, with the assistance of accessory proteins, recognize branched RNA/DNA configurations. In the current model of Okazaki fragment maturation, displacement of a 27-nucleotide or longer flap is envisioned to attract replication protein A (RPA), which inhibits flap endonuclease-1 (FEN-1) but stimulates Dna2 nuclease for cleavage. Dna2 cleavage generates a short flap of 5-7 nucleotides, which resists binding by RPA and further cleavage by Dna2. FEN-1 then removes the remaining flap to produce a suitable substrate for ligation. However, FEN-1 is not efficient in cleaving the short flap, and we therefore set out to identify cellular factors that might regulate FEN-1 activity. Through co-immunoprecipitation experiments, we have isolated heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein A1 (hnRNP A1), which forms a direct complex with FEN-1 and stimulates its enzymatic activities. The stimulation by hnRNP A1 is most dramatic using DNA substrates with short flaps. With longer flap substrates the hnRNP A1 effect is more modest and is suppressed by the addition of RPA. A model is provided to explain the possible in vivo role of this interaction and activity in Okazaki fragment maturation.
