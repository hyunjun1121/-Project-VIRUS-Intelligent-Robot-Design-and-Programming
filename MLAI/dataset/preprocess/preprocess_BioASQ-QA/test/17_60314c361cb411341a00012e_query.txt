What is Aortitis?

[PMID: 32234379]
Aortitis and periaortitis are inflammatory diseases of the aorta and its main branches; they differ in the extension of inflammation, which is confined to the aortic wall in aortitis, and spreads to the periaortic space in periaortitis. Aortitis is classified as non-infectious or infectious. Non-infectious aortitis represents a common feature of large-vessel vasculitides but can also be isolated or associated with other rheumatologic conditions. Periaortitis can be idiopathic or secondary to a wide array of etiologies such as drugs, infections, malignancies, and other proliferative diseases. Notably, both aortitis and periaortitis may arise in the context of IgG4-related disease, a recently characterised fibro-inflammatory systemic disease. Prompt recognition, correct diagnosis and appropriate treatment are essential in order to avoid life-threatening complications.

1. Syphilitic aortitis is a productive inflammatory process, the earliest and most constant feature of which is a perivascular round cell infiltration in the adventitia. 2. The typical gross picture of luetic aortitis is often obscured by a superimposed, diffuse atherosclerosis. In the early cases the aorta appears fairly normal, presenting only the characteristic histological changes. 3. A pure aortic insufficient valve, with the exception of an infectious endocarditis, is always luetic. 4. Cardiac hypertrophy is not a complication of luetic aortitis. When present it is usually associated with a nephritis. 5. The demonstration of Spirochoeta pallida, even in advanced specimens of syphilitic aortas, is doubtful. 6. An antigen prepared from alcoholic extract of guinea pig heart with the original Wassermann technique should be preferred in diagnosing luetic aortitis. 7. Positive complement fixations in patients suffering with syphilis for a period of about fifteen years or longer suggest the probability, at least, of histological luetic changes in the aorta in 80 to 90 per cent of the cases. 60 per cent of these die from aortitis. 8. About 94 per cent of patients suffering with aortitis give positive Wassermann reactions.

Aortitis is a general term denoting inflammation of the aortic wall. Various infectious and non-infectious diseases can be complicated by aortitis; in addition, isolated idiopathic aortitis has also been described. In a 12-year nationwide Danish population-based study, the prevalence of aortitis among 1,210 resected thoracic aorta samples was 6.1%, with nearly three-quarters of cases being idiopathic. Identified risk factors for aortitis included advanced age, a history of connective tissue disease, diabetes mellitus, and heart valve pathology. As in virtually all pathological studies, this study has a bias toward reporting the most severe cases of aortitis requiring surgical repair.

BACKGROUND Inflammation of the aortic wall, known as aortitis, is a rare clinical entity which is frequently asymptomatic, or identified when the patient presents with an aortic aneurysm or dissection. It is most often caused by infection or autoimmune vasculitides such as giant cell or Takayasu's arteritis. CASE REPORT The case presented is that of a 55-year-old man with symptomatic occlusion of the right coronary artery caused by a plasmacytic aortitis suggestive of IgG4 disease, which was successfully treated with coronary artery bypass grafting and an ascending aortic graft. CONCLUSIONS A review of the current literature emphasizes how poorly the etiology and natural history of plasmacytic aortitis is understood.

Aortitis is a subtype of the more general term "vasculitis", an inflammatory condition of infectious or noninfectious origin involving the vessel wall. The term "vasculitis" refers to a broad spectrum of diseases with different aetiologies, pathophysiologies, clinical presentations and prognoses. The clinical manifestations are nonspecific, as are the laboratory findings such as pain, fever, weight loss, vascular insufficiency and elevated levels of acute phase reactants, as well as other systemic manifestations, and sometimes may mimic other entities. Thus, if not suspected as part of the initial differential diagnosis, aortitis can be overlooked during the workup of patients with constitutional symptoms and systemic disorders. Imaging is rarely used for the primary diagnosis, but imaging findings, although nonspecific, can help in the assessment of these patients and is often required for making the final diagnosis. Imaging can be critical in the initiation of appropriate management and therapy. Noninvasive cross-sectional imaging modalities such as contrast-enhanced CT, magnetic resonance (MR) imaging, nuclear medicine and in particular positron emission tomography (PET) are the leading modalities in modern diagnostic imaging of aortitis for both the initial diagnosis and follow-up. This review focusses on the most common manifestations of aortitis with which radiologists should be familiar. TEACHING POINTS : • Aortitis is an inflammatory condition of infectious/noninfectious origin involving the vessel wall. • Imaging findings can help in the assessment of aortitis and are often crucial for the final diagnosis. • Contrast-enhanced CT, MRI and PET-CT are used for both the initial diagnosis and follow-up of aortitis.

Aortitis is a pathological term designating inflammation of the aortic wall, regardless of its cause. The clinical presentation of aortitis is nonspecific and variable. Symptoms include abdominal pain, fever, and weight loss; acute phase reactants may also be elevated. Aortitis can be caused by a wide spectrum of entities, including from infectious processes to autoimmune diseases (Takayasu arteritis and giant cell arteritis are among the most common of these causing aortitis), and the prognosis and treatment of these entities vary widely. Various imaging techniques can be used to evaluate the lumen and wall of the aorta (such as multidetector computed tomography, magnetic resonance imaging, angiography, or PET-CT). This review focuses on the most common diseases that cause aortitis and on the clinical and radiological findings that are most useful for diagnosing and treating this condition appropriately.

IgG4 related thoracic aortitis is a recent addition to the differential diagnosis for inflammatory aortic disease - a condition which is often underappreciated until complications arise such as aneurysmal formation or aortic dissection. Currently, IgG4 aortitis remains a post-surgical diagnosis reliant on positive immunohistochemistry findings. Management is guided by the extent of disease involvement, which can be gauged by serum IgG4 levels and radiological findings. Options include surgical resection, corticosteroid therapy and steroid-sparing agents to prevent relapses.

Aortitis is the inflammation of the aorta due to various causes. Clinical presentations vary as well as the imaging findings. Exact pathogenetic mechanisms or triggering factors, as well as the best diagnostic and monitoring modalities and treatment strategies, are yet to be elucidated. We reviewed recent studies in aortitis and associated diseases. Multiple cohort studies reporting long-term outcomes in patients with noninfectious aortitis were recently published. Comparative features of isolated aortitis were described. Six angiographic clusters for giant cell arteritis and Takayasu have been identified. New classification criteria have been proposed for IgG4-related disease by a data-driven method. The ultrasonographic slope sign and a halo score were described as specific imaging parameters in giant cell arteritis. The promising role of PET-computed tomography, not only in the diagnosis of aortitis but also in monitoring disease activity, has been noted. Results of in-vitro studies on Janus kinase (JAK)/signal transducers and activators of transcription and mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) pathways, comparative studies with leflunomide as an induction therapy, and a long-term follow-up study with tocilizumab may contribute to the management of Takayasu arteritis. An impressive number of studies have addressed aortitis in recent years. However, there still is a lack of robust data on causes, monitoring disease activity by imaging and biomarkers, and drugs providing steroid-free remission in noninfectious aortitis.

Aortitis is the all-encompassing pathological term ascribed to inflammation of the aorta. Regardless of the etiology, it frequently results in aortic root dilatation and aortic insufficiency rather than aortic stenosis. The rare case of aortitis such as isolated idiopathic aortitis may occur without evidence of systenic inflammatory disease or infection, and usually has subclinical nature. Even though the goals of therapy include immediate treatment of aortic inflammation or infection, the optimal management of isolated idiopathic aortitis is uncertain. We report a rare case of isolated idiopathic aortitis mimicking acute severe aortic stenosis, which was improved after steroid therapy.

Aortitis is defined as an inflammatory process that involves one or more layers of the aortic wall (internal elastic lamina, tunica media, and adventitia) and can be caused by multiple mechanisms. Clinical features are usually nonspecific and a high index of suspicion is required for making the diagnosis. Although noninvasive imaging studies are being increasingly used in evaluating patients for diagnosis, angiography remains the gold standard for confirming aortic involvement. When tissue is available, pathologic examination can aid in clarifying the diagnosis. Aortitis, irrespective of the underlying cause, frequently displays similar clinical, pathologic, and arteriographic features and therefore understandably presents a therapeutic and diagnostic dilemma. Whatever the cause, early identification and aggressive treatment is required in order to avert the potentially life-threatening sequelae. The treatment of aortitis is determined by the underlying cause. If diagnosed early, infectious aortitis responds to appropriate antimicrobial therapy, whereas noninfectious, immune-mediated aortitis requires immunosuppressive therapy. However, in many instances, primarily because of the delay in diagnosis, surgical intervention is necessary to treat the associated anatomic and physiologic sequelae. Less definitive and more controversial is the role of inflammation in both primary and secondary accelerated atherosclerosis of the aorta and its modality of treatment.

"Aortitis" is a pathologic term that refers to an abnormal inflammation of the aortic wall. A wide spectrum of infectious, inflammatory, and idiopathic conditions may result in the development of aortitis. Infectious aortitis may be secondary to bacterial, tubercular, syphilitic, and viral pathogens. Although Takayasu arteritis and giant cell arteritis are the most common rheumatologic causes of aortitis, the other systemic diseases, such as rheumatoid arthritis, systemic lupus erythematosus, Behçet disease, and Cogan syndrome, may also be associated with aortitis. In addition, aortitis may also occur without any systemic diseases or infectious causes (idiopathic). Clinical features of aortitis are nonspecific and may include fever, abdominal or chest pain, and vascular insufficiency. Patients may have elevated serum levels of acute phase reactants. A high index of clinical suspicion is always needed for the diagnosis of aortitis in a timely manner. Cross-sectional imaging techniques, such as computed tomographic angiography, magnetic resonance imaging, magnetic resonance angiography, and positron emission tomography, are extremely helpful in diagnosis, assessing disease activity, treatment planning, and post-treatment follow-up. Many of the patients with aortitis may require a multimodality imaging approach for appropriate diagnosis. Knowledge of the clinical features and cross-sectional imaging findings of different types of aortitis permit optimal patient management.

Aortitis is a pathological term that refers to the inflammation of one or more layers of the aortic wall. It is associated with a wide spectrum of inflammatory diseases of infectious and non-infectious origins, and often present with vague clinical findings and non-specific laboratory results that can model other entities. As a result, aortitis may not form part of the initial workup and appropriate treatment can be delayed or missed. Therefore, imaging modalities are required to assess for inflammation and structural changes in the aorta to support or exclude the diagnosis of aortitis. This review presents current literature on the imaging modalities utilized in the diagnosis and management of aortitis, which surgeons and physicians should be familiar with for providing optimal patient care.

Takayasu aortitis is a well known yet rare form of large vessel vasculitis. Also known as pulseless disease, occlusive thromboaortopathy, and Martorell syndrome, is a chronic inflammatory aortitis. Vessel inflammation leads to wall thickening, fibrosis, stenosis, and thrombus formation. A 64-year-old woman was referred to emergency for lack of pulse in the upper and lower limbs and changes in heart rate. AngioRMN revealed dissection of the ascending aorta while in PET, intense uptake of FDG-F18 involving ascending, crossa, descending thoracic and abdominal segments of the aorta, was evident urgent surgical correction occurred. An aorta ring segment with 2.5cm length, showed whitish and smooth intimate, with linear transversal laceration, with regular borders. Dissection 1cm long of the medial tunica was occupied by a clot in continuity with a thrombus occupying the neoformed lumen. Microscopy examination confirmed hyalinization of the tunica media with impregnation of fibrin / thrombus with blood cell elements. Endothelial inflammatory characteristics together with vasa vasorum and vascular trajectory of the periphery of the tunica media with inflammatory cells involvement allowed the diagnosis of Takayasu aortitis. Takayasu aortitis is rare in the presented age group, with early non-specific symptoms. The diagnosis of aortic dissection was crucial, constituting a medical emergency. Heather L-Gomik (2008) supports the hyaline structural alteration of the tunica media. The disease has been recognized for more than 100 years, and patients with Takayasu aortitis remain relatively poor and treatment is suboptimal. Key areas for improvement include the need for increase disease awareness and earlier diagnosis, and improved means for monitoring disease activity. The demonstration of diferential expression of Toll-like receptors in arteries, is particularly intriguing and worthy of further investigation.

Aortitis can be the manifestation of an underlying infectious or noninfectious disease process. An autoimmune cause is suggested in a large proportion of noninfectious causes. Similar to other autoimmune diseases, the pathophysiology of aortitis has been investigated in detail, but the etiology remains unknown. Most cases of aortitis often go undetected for a long time and are often identified at late stages of the disease. Recent advances in imaging techniques have significantly improved the diagnosis of aortitis. However, significant challenges associated with the imaging techniques limit their use. Several routine inflammation-based markers, such as erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR), C-reactive protein (CRP), and inflammatory cytokines, are nonspecific and, therefore, have limited use in the diagnosis of aortitis. The search for more specific serum biomarkers, which can facilitate detection and progression is under progress. Several autoantibodies have been identified, but assigning their role in the pathogenesis as well as their specificity remains a challenge. The current review addresses some of these issues in detail. KEY MESSAGES: • Noninfectious aortitis is an autoimmune disease. • Several biomarkers, including cytokines and autoantibodies, are increased in aortitis. • Imaging techniques, commonly used to detect aortitis, are associated with the high cost and technical challenges. • There is a need to develop low-cost biomarker-based detection tools. • The knowledge of biomarkers in aortitis detection is discussed.

Aortitis is a general term that refers to a broad category of infectious or noninfectious conditions in which there is abnormal inflammation of the aortic wall. These inflammatory conditions have different clinical and morphologic features and variable prognoses. The clinical manifestations are usually vague and nonspecific and may include pain, fever, vascular insufficiency, and elevated levels of acute phase reactants, as well as other systemic manifestations. As a result, aortitis is often overlooked during the initial work-up of patients with constitutional symptoms and systemic disorders. A multimodality imaging approach is often required for assessment of both the aortic wall and aortic lumen, as well as for surveillance of disease activity and treatment planning. Noninvasive cross-sectional imaging modalities such as magnetic resonance (MR) imaging, MR angiography, and computed tomographic angiography play a critical role in initial evaluation and further assessment of aortitis. Radiologists should be familiar with the clinical features and imaging findings of the different types of aortitis.

Aortitis is typically a chronic, progressive disease manifestation associated with large vessel vasculitidies, most notably giant cell, Takayasu arteritis, and a newly described entity, isolated aortitis. The aortitis may lead to aneurysm formation and symptoms associated with branch vessel occlusion in these diseases, but aortic dissection is rare and usually a late complication of smoldering, incompletely treated disease. We present a case of aortitis in a previously healthy 39-year-old man who succumbed to aortic dissection hours after the onset of symptoms. No aneurysm or fibrosis was found on postmortem examination. The inflammation was characterized by disruption of the media with patchy transmural chronic and focally acute inflammatory infiltrate. We review case reports of other individuals with aortitis, who initially or very early in their course presented with aortic dissection in the absence of known rheumatic disease and most without evidence of aneurysm formation. We believe that this represents a process characterized by an aggressive vasculitis of the aorta with its own clinical features, a fulminant variety of isolated aortitis.

Aortitis includes conditions with infectious or non-infectious etiology, characterized by inflammatory changes in one or more layers in aortic wall. Age at onset, geographic predilections, distribution and pattern of involvement in aorta, its branches and pulmonary arteries, and systemic associations provide a clue to etiology. Clinical presentations are often non-specific. An integrated approach including clinical, laboratory and imaging assessment is essential to confirm diagnosis and plan treatment. Assessment of disease activity is the key as it influences timing and outcome of treatment. Markers of activity include clinical, laboratory and imaging. Medical management remains the first-line therapy. Revascularization is indicated in the presence of hemodynamically significant stenosis and inactive disease. In the presence of flash pulmonary edema, left ventricular dysfunction or hypertensive encephalopathy, revascularization is performed irrespective of disease activity. Endovascular management is favored over surgery due to its high success and low restenosis rates. Symptomatic aneurysmal disease is usually managed by surgery.
