Which hormone receptor function is altered in patients with Donohue syndrome?

[PMID: 22972224]
Leprechaunism (Donohue syndrome) is the most severe type of insulin receptor (INSR) gene anomaly with the majority of patients surviving for only 2 years. We report a surviving 2 -year-old male with leprechaunism, bearing novel compound heterozygous mutations in the INSR. The patient is a Japanese boy with acanthosis nigricans, lack of subcutaneous fat, hirsutism, thick lips, gum hypertrophy and extremely high insulin levels (6702 mU/mL). He was as having identified novel compound heterozygous mutations in INSR (p.T910M and p. E1047K). At 24 day-old, recombinant human insulin-like growth factor 1 (rh-IGF1) treatment was started because of poor weight gain. At 2 years old, the patient's serum glucose level and HbA1C value had worsened, and both a bolus of rh-IGF-1 and a subcutaneous injection of a rapid-acting insulin analog after meals, in addition to α-glycosidase inhibitor, were initiated from 2 years onward. Oxygen administration and biphasic positive airway pressure treatment were also initiated from 2 years old due to upper airway obstruction with adenoidal hypertrophy. In the experiments conducted using COS7 cells homozygously transfected with the INSR mutation, T910M INSR failed to process the proreceptor and decreased insulin-stimulated tyrosine phosphorylation. E1047K INSR resulted in a complete absence of insulin-stimulated tyrosine phosphorylation. These findings suggest the near absence of INSR in this patient. We consider that the rhIGF1 treatment contributed to his long survival, but it was not able to prevent his diabetic condition. Our report provides important insights into the function of INSR, and for the treatment of leprechaunism.

Donohue syndrome (DS) is a rare and lethal autosomal recessive disease caused by mutations in the insulin receptor (INSR) gene, manifesting marked insulin resistance, severe growth retardation, hypertrichosis, and characteristic dysmorphic features. We report the clinical, molecular, and biochemical characterization of three new patients with DS, and address genotype-phenotype issues playing a role in the pathophysiology of DS. A female infant born to first-degree cousins Muslim Arab parents and two brothers born to first-degree cousins Druze parents presented classical features of DS with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy and died in infancy. Each patient was found homozygous for one missense mutation within the extracellular domain of the INSR gene. Western blot analysis identified the proreceptor of INSR, but not its mature subunits alpha and beta. Of 95 healthy Muslims, no heterozygous was found and of 52 healthy Druze from the same village, one was heterozygous. This study presents two novel familial mutations in the alpha subunit of the INSR which appear to impair post-translational processing of the INSR, resulting loss of its function. Both mutations cause DS with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy and early death. Identification of the causative mutation enables prevention of this devastating disease.

Rabson-Mendenhall syndrome (RMS) is a rare, recessively inherited disorder of extreme insulin resistance due to mutations in the insulin receptor gene. We have identified a pair of siblings with RMS attributable to compound heterozygosity for two insulin receptor mutations, one previously unreported, and have characterized the novel receptor mutation functionally. Insulin receptor sequencing was performed to identify the mutations. Expression levels of the mature receptor were determined in lymphoblastoid cells from the affected subjects. Further studies of immortalized cell lines transfected with mutant and wild type (WT) receptors were undertaken to characterize the effects of the novel mutation on [(125)I]-labelled insulin binding, proreceptor processing and insulin-stimulated receptor autophosphorylation. Sequencing of the insulin proreceptor coding sequence revealed both siblings to be compound heterozygotes for the missense mutations Arg209His and Gly359Ser in the mature insulin receptor. The former mutation has been described in homozygous form in Donohue syndrome, while the latter is novel. Insulin receptor expression in lymphoblastoid cell lines was present at only 10-30% of that in control cells; studies of immortalized cells transfected with mutant and WT receptors confirmed the reduced expression of the mutant. The degree of impairment of insulin binding and insulin-stimulated receptor autophosphorylation were commensurate with the decrease in expression of the mature receptor. Loss of function of the novel insulin receptor (INSR) G359S variant is largely accounted for by aberrant proreceptor processing rather than intrinsically impaired signal transduction by the mutant receptor.

Donohue syndrome describes the clinical consequences of the most severe genetic loss of insulin receptor function. The cardinal features are severe linear growth impairment pre- and postnatally with abnormal glucose metabolism and a characteristic pattern of soft tissue overgrowth. We report a 5 day old neonate with refractory hyperglycemia and paradoxical hypoglycemia, severe intrauterine growth retardation, typical 'elfin' facies (hypertrichosis, large and low-set ears, broad nasal tip, flared nares, thick lips), reduced subcutaneous fat, distended abdomen, and enlarged external genitalia and nipples. Fasting serum insulin and C-peptide were severely elevated at >2,100 pmol/l and >2,331 pmol/l, respectively. In addition, hepatic, ovarian and renal enlargement was demonstrated by ultrasonography. The neonate died within two months secondary to hypoglycemia. Diplex PCR analysis of the insulin receptor gene revealed the neonate to be homozygous for deletion of exon 3. Both parents were heterozygous for this deletion but were metabolically healthy. As such a deletion has previously been reported in Israel, we suggest that it may show a founder effect in the Middle East.

Donohue syndrome (leprechaunism; OMIM *246200) is a rare, recessively inherited disorder of extreme insulin resistance due to mutations in the insulin receptor gene (INSR) causing either defects in insulin binding or receptor autophosphorylation and tyrosine kinase activity. We report a patient with pronounced clinical picture of leprechaunism who developed severe progressive hypertrophic obstructive cardiomyopathy (HOCM) and renal tubular dysfunction which improved on continuous subcutaneous infusion of recombinant human insulin-like growth factor-1 (rhIGF-I). INSR gene molecular analysis and insulin receptor (IR) autophosphorylation on cultured fibroblasts were performed. A novel homozygous missense mutation p.Leu795Pro was found, located in the extracellular portion of the β subunit of the insulin receptor. The post-binding defect of the insulin receptor signaling in cultured fibroblasts demonstrated decreased insulin receptor autophosphorylation. Treatment with rhIGF-I partially reversed severe progressive HOCM and renal tubular dysfunction in a patient with Donohue syndrome associated with a novel p.Leu795Pro INSR gene mutation causing a severe decrease in IR autophosphorylation.

Leprechaunism is a rare congenital syndrome caused by mutations of the insulin receptor gene, transmitted in an autosomal recessive pattern. Insulin growth factor-1 (IGF-1) treatment can be a therapeutic option in this syndrome by its insulin-like effects. Nevertheless, it is of note that IGF-1 has also an angiogenic activity. Fundus examination by ophthalmoscopy, fluorangiography, and laser treatment were performed. A 17-year-old girl with leprechaunism, under treatment with high doses of insulin, presented a florid diabetic retinopathy. The large neovascularization of the disk regressed after treatment with argon laser panretinal photocoagulation. Five years after treatment, the patient maintained good vision. This clinical case is of interest for 2 reasons: 1) the large retinal neovascularization was likely due to the high insulin dosages; 2) this is the first case in which a sustained regression of retinal neovascularization has been observed after laser treatment in leprechaunism.

Leprechaunism is a rare autosomal recessive disease that is characterized by severe insulin resistance. This disease is caused by a defective insulin receptor and features abnormal glucose metabolism and retarded intrauterine and postnatal growth. However, there are few reports on the long-term course of leprechaunism. We reported the long-term clinical course and rh-IGF-1 treatment in a patient with leprechaunism. During follow-up her diabetes gradually deteriorated despite of treatment of rh-IGF-1. Furthermore, she developed endometrioid adenocarcinoma at the age of 24 yr. The development of endometrial disease must be carefully followed up in this disease.

Homozygous or compound heterozygous mutations within the insulin binding domain of the human insulin receptor (INSR) are usually associated with severe impairment of insulin binding leading to Donohue syndrome ("Leprechaunism"), which is characterized by excessive hyperglycemia with hyperinsulinism, pre- and postnatal growth retardation, distinct dysmorphism and early death. Missense mutations in the beta subunits are commonly associated with a milder impairment of insulin binding and milder phenotype with prolonged survival and less dysmorphism, the so called Rabson-Mendenhall syndrome. We report on a 13-year-old girl with Donohue syndrome like dysmorphism, hyperinsulinism and prolonged survival due to two novel INSR missense mutations within the insulin binding domain. Unexpectedly, insulin binding assays and investigations of activation of central insulin signaling pathways in fibroblasts revealed no significant alterations. Instead, immunofluorescence studies showed abnormal perinuclear distribution of the INSR alpha and beta subunits. Our data indicate that the quality of insulin binding activity is correlated with survival, not with the dysmorphic phenotype, and it is not always a valid parameter for predicting INSR mutations as proposed.

Donohue syndrome (DS) is a rare autosomal recessive condition caused by mutations in the gene encoding the insulin receptor. It is characterised by severe metabolic and endocrine derangement, prenatal and postnatal linear growth impairment, soft tissue overgrowth, and poor development of adipose tissue and muscle. Causes of death, which is often within the first year of life, include intercurrent infection and, in some cases, heart failure. Management is currently based on case reports and very small case series only, and no formal guidelines or recommendations exist. We describe a preterm infant who had typical features of DS but who later developed hypertrophic cardiomyopathy with heart failure leading to death at 10 weeks old. Molecular genetic analysis revealed compound heterozygosity for the previously reported p.Arg890X nonsense mutation and the novel p.Tyr818Cys missense mutation in the INSR gene. Tyrosine 818 falls in an exquisitely conserved residue of the alphabeta fibronectin domain of the insulin receptor, whose structure and function are much less well understood than other parts of the receptor. We discuss management options for DS, including the therapeutic dilemma around whether recombinant human insulin-like growth factor 1, one of the few available treatments for the syndrome, may exacerbate hypertrophic cardiomyopathy and cardiac failure.

Insulin plays a very important role in maintaining homeostasis of the whole organism. It regulates glucose metabolism, glycogen synthesis, lipid and protein metabolism. Insulin receptors are present in virtually all cells, which is reflected by the diversity of regulatory processes in which this hormone is involved. Any dysfunction of insulin signalling pathway as a result of insulin receptor gene mutations is linked with various forms of insulin resistance, including insulin resistance type A, Donohue or Rabson-Mendenhall syndrome, which differ in the level of severity. Molecular analysis of insulin receptor gene may lead to a better understanding of molecular mechanisms underlying various types of insulin resistance and help to develop a more efficient treatment. They may also be used as a powerful tool in prenatal diagnostics as well as in pregnancy planning.

Biallelic insulin receptor (INSR) gene mutations cause congenital syndromes of severe insulin resistance (SIR) known as Donohue syndrome (DS) and Rabson-Mendenhall syndrome (RMS). At presentation, DS and RMS are difficult to differentiate since they share many clinical features; however, while patients with DS usually die within 1 year of birth, individuals classified as RMS can reach adult age. INSR mutations can be also found in pubertal females with hyperinsulinism, hyperandrogenism, and acanthosis nigricans (type A SIR). We studied the INSR gene in five subjects with congenital SIR and in a patient with type A SIR. Nine biallelic INSR gene mutations (eight novels, including an in-frame deletion of INSR signal peptide) were identified in patients with congenital SIR; a heterozygous, spontaneous INSR mutation was detected in the patient with type A SIR. Two probands, presenting severe hirsutism at birth, died at the age of 3 months and were classified as DS, while other 2, currently 2 and 3 years old, were diagnosed with RMS (patients 3 and 4). The fifth patient with congenital SIR died when 14 months old. Nephrocalcinosis, hyperaldosteronism, hyperreninemia, and hypokalemia, in the absence of hypertension, were discovered in patients 3 and 5 when 24 and 4 months old, respectively. Patient 3, now 3 years/3 months old, still shows hyperreninemic hyperaldosteronism requiring potassium supplementation. We conclude that renal abnormalities resembling antenatal Bartter's syndrome type II, recently reported also by others, is a common observation in patients with congenital SIR.
