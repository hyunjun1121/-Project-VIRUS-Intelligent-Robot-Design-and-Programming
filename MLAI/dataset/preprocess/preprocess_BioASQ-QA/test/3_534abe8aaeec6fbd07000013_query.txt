Which heat shock protein is found to be upregulated during Hsp90 inhibition?

Excessive reactive oxygen species contribute to vascular dysfunction. We have previously shown that heat shock protein (Hsp90) inhibitors potently suppress Nox 1 to 3 and 5, and the goals of this study were to identify how molecular chaperones regulate Nox function. In vitro, protein expression of Nox 1 to 2, 5 was decreased by Hsp90 inhibitors in multiple cell types (human pulmonary artery endothelial cells, neutrophils, macrophages, and human saphenous vein). In mice treated with Hsp90 inhibitors, Nox1 expression was reduced in lung along with reduced reactive oxygen species from leukocytes. Elevated reactive oxygen species production in obese (db/db) aorta was suppressed by Hsp90 inhibition. Hsp90 inhibitors did not alter Nox5 micro RNA levels, and proteasome inhibition prevented Nox2 and 5 protein degradation and increased ubiquitin incorporation. Inhibition of Hsp90 upregulated the expression of Hsp70 and Hsp70-bound Nox2, 5 and promoted degradation. Silencing Hsp70 prevented Hsp90 inhibitor-mediated degradation of Nox5. The Hsp70-regulated ubiquitin ligase, carboxyl terminus of Hsp70-interacting protein (CHIP), also bound Nox5 and promoted increased Nox5 ubiquitination and degradation. The chaperone binding and ubiquitination domains of CHIP were required, and the silencing of CHIP blunted Hsp90 inhibitor-mediated degradation of Nox2 and 5. We conclude that Hsp90 binds to and regulates Nox protein stability. These actions are opposed by Hsp70 and CHIP, which promote the ubiquitination and degradation of Nox proteins and reduce reactive oxygen species production.

The heat shock protein (HSP) 90 chaperone machine involved in numerous oncogenic signaling pathways is overexpressed in cancer cells and is currently being evaluated for anticancer therapy. Neuroendocrine tumors (NETs) of the gastroenteropancreatic (GEP) system comprise a heterogeneous group of tumors with increasing incidence and poor prognosis. Here, we report the antiproliferative effects of the HSP90 inhibitors AUY922 and HSP990 in neuroendocrine tumor cells. Treatment of human pancreatic BON1, bronchopulmonary NCI-H727 and midgut carcinoid GOT1 neuroendocrine tumor cells with increasing concentrations of AUY922 and HSP990 dose-dependently suppressed cell viability. Significant effects on neuroendocrine cell viability were observed with inhibitor concentrations as low as 5 nM. Inhibition of cell viability was associated with the induction of apoptosis as demonstrated by an increase in sub-G1 events and PARP cleavage. HSP90 inhibition was associated with decreased neuroendocrine ErbB and IGF-I receptor expression, decreased Erk and Akt phospho-rylation and the induction of HSP70 expression. These findings provide evidence that targeted inhibition of upregulated HSP90 activity could be useful for the treatment of aggressive neuroendocrine tumors resistant to conventional therapy.

Targeting heat shock protein 90 (HSP90) has gained great interest for cancer therapy. However, in view of novel multimodality therapy approaches for treating hepatic metastases, concerns have raised regarding the impact of targeted therapies on liver regeneration and repair. In this study, we investigated the impact of HSP90 inhibition on liver regeneration in murine models. Effects of HSP90 inhibition on the activation of signaling intermediates, expression of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), and hepatocyte growth factor (HGF) were investigated in primary human hepatocytes (PHHs) in vitro. Effects of HSP90 inhibition on liver regeneration and repair were determined in a murine hepatectomy model and in a model with acute carbon tetrachloride (CCl(4))-induced liver damage. Inhibition of HSP90 effectively diminished the constitutive phosphorylation of Akt, Erk, and STAT3 in PHHs. Conversely, inhibition of HSP90 significantly increased the expression of both VEGF and HGF mRNA, and induced HSP70 protein in PHH cultures in vitro. In vivo, HSP90 inhibition significantly upregulated constitutive VEGF mRNA and HSP70 in murine livers and did not impair liver re-growth after 70% hepatectomy. Furthermore, BrdUrd-staining and histological quantification of necrotic areas revealed that HSP90 inhibition did not impair liver regeneration following partial hepatectomy, or liver repair that occurs after toxic liver injury with CCl(4). Targeting HSP90 does not negatively affect the multifactorial process of liver regeneration and repair in vivo. Hence, the use of inhibitors to HSP90 appears to be a valid option for neoadjuvant therapy of liver metastases when subsequent surgery is intended.
