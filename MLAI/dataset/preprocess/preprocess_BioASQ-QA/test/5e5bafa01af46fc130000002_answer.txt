IDEAL_ANSWER:
- The coronavirus peplomer protein S is responsible for attachment and fusion during viral entry as well as for the induction of cell to cell fusion.
Since tissue affinities are a function of the viral peplomer-mediated attachment of virus to cells and are often directly related to pathogenicity,

EXACT_ANSWER:
- attachment and fusion during viral entry as well as for the induction of cell to cell fusion.
