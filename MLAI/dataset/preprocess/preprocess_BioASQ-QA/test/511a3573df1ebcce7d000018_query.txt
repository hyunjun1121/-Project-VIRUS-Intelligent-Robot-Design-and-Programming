How many tissue kallikrein genes are present in the human genome?

[PMID: 15015574]
Human kallikreins are a cluster of 15 serine protease genes located in the chromosomal band 19q13.4, a non-randomly rearranged region in many solid tumors, including pancreatic cancer. We utilized the SAGE and EST databases of the Cancer Genome Anatomy Project to perform in-silico analysis of kallikrein gene expression in normal and cancerous pancreatic and colon tissues and cell lines using virtual Northern blotting (VNB), digital differential display (DDD) and X-profiler. At least two kallikreins, KLK6 and KLK10, are significantly up-regulated in pancreatic cancer. We probed 2 normal and 6 pancreatic cancer SAGE libraries with gene-specific tags for each of these kallikreins. KLK6 was found to be expressed in 5/6 cancer libraries and showed the most marked (5-fold) increase in average expression levels in cancer vs. normal. These data were verified by screening the EST databases, where all mRNA clones isolated were from cancerous libraries, with no clones detected in normal pancreatic tissues or cell lines. X-profiler comparison of two pools of normal and cancerous pancreatic libraries further verified the significant increase of KLK6 expression levels in pancreatic cancer. DDD data showed a 13-fold increase in KLK10 expression in pancreatic cancer. Three kallikrein genes, KLK6, 8 and 10 are overexpressed in colon cancer compared to normal colon, while one kallikrein, KLK1, is down-regulated. While no expression of KLK6 was detected in normal colon, KLK6-specific tags were detectable in 2 cancer libraries. Similar results were obtained by EST screening; no KLK6 clones were detected in any of the 28 normal libraries examined, while 10 KLK6 EST clones were found in colon adenocarcinoma. KLK10 was not detectable in normal colon. Gene-specific tags were, however, detectable with high density in colon cancer and 7 EST clones were found to be expressed in colon Adenocarcinoma.

Kallikrein-related peptidases (KLKs) constitute a family of 15 highly conserved serine proteases encoded by the largest uninterrupted cluster of protease-encoding genes within the human genome. Recent studies, mostly relying on in vitro proteolysis of recombinant proteins, have suggested that KLK activities are regulated by proteolytic activation cascades that can operate in a tissue-specific manner, such as the semen liquefaction and skin desquamation cascades. The validity of KLK activation cascades in vivo largely remains to be demonstrated. Here, we focus on recent investigations showing that KLKs represent interesting players in the broader field of immunology based on their ability to bridge their inherent ability to degrade the extracellular matrix with major functions of the immune system. More specifically, KLKs assist in the infiltration of immune cells through the skin and the blood brain barrier, whereas they catalyze the generation of antimicrobial peptides by proteolytic activation and further processing of protein precursors. In an attempt to integrate current knowledge, we propose KLK-mediated pathways that are putatively involved in inflammation associated with skin wounding and central nervous system disorders, including multiple sclerosis. Finally, we present evidence of KLK participation in autoimmune diseases and allergies.

Human tissue kallikreins (hKs) are attracting increased attention owing to their association with various forms of cancer and other diseases. Human tissue kallikrein genes represent the largest contiguous group of proteases within the human genome. There are many areas of kallikrein research that need to be further explored, including their tissue expression patterns, their regulation, identification of specific substrates, their participation in proteolytic cascades, and their clinical applicability as cancer biomarkers and therapeutic targets. In this review, we briefly describe the current status of kallikrein research and identify future avenues that will enhance our understanding of their function and involvement in human diseases.

Kallikreins are a subgroup of serine proteases with diverse physiological functions. Recently, growing evidence indicates that many kallikrein genes are involved in malignancy. In rodents, kallikreins are encoded by a large multigene family, but in humans only three kallikreins were thought to exist. Based on the homology between the human and rodent kallikrein loci, we studied a 300 kb region of genomic sequences around the putative KLK1 gene locus on chromosome 19q13.3-q13.4. By using linear sequence information, restriction analysis, end sequencing, PCR and blotting techniques, as well as bioinformatic approaches, we were able to construct the first detailed map of the human kallikrein gene family. Comparative analysis of genes located in this area, provides strong evidence that the human kallikrein gene family locus on chromosome 19 is considerably larger than previously thought, containing at least fifteen genes. We have established, for the first time, the common structural features that apply to all members of the expanded kallikrein multigene family. Our map specifies the distance between genes to one base pair accuracy, the relative location, and the direction of transcription of all 15 genes. Determination of the true size of the kallikrein family in humans is important for our understanding of the contribution of the kallikreins to human biology and pathophysiology.

The gene family of human kallikrein-related peptidases (KLKs) encodes proteins with diverse and pleiotropic functions in normal physiology as well as in disease states. Currently, the most widely known KLK is KLK3 or prostate-specific antigen (PSA) that has applications in clinical diagnosis and monitoring of prostate cancer. The KLK gene family encompasses the largest contiguous cluster of serine proteases in humans which is not interrupted by non-KLK genes. This exceptional and unique characteristic of KLKs makes them ideal for evolutionary studies aiming to infer the direction and timing of gene duplication events. Previous studies on the evolution of KLKs were restricted to mammals and the emergence of KLKs was suggested about 150 million years ago (mya). In order to elucidate the evolutionary history of KLKs, we performed comprehensive phylogenetic analyses of KLK homologous proteins in multiple genomes including those that have been completed recently. Interestingly, we were able to identify novel reptilian, avian and amphibian KLK members which allowed us to trace the emergence of KLKs 330 mya. We suggest that a series of duplication and mutation events gave rise to the KLK gene family. The prominent feature of the KLK family is that it consists of tandemly and uninterruptedly arrayed genes in all species under investigation. The chromosomal co-localization in a single cluster distinguishes KLKs from trypsin and other trypsin-like proteases which are spread in different genetic loci. All the defining features of the KLKs were further found to be conserved in the novel KLK protein sequences. The study of this unique family will further assist in selecting new model organisms for functional studies of proteolytic pathways involving KLKs.

Kallikreins are proteolytic enzymes that constitute a subfamily of serine proteases. Novel kallikrein genes were cloned recently, and it was shown that the human kallikrein family contains 15 genes tandemly aligned on chromosomal locus 19q13.3-q13.4. Based on their altered expression in tumor cells, kallikreins may be involved in the pathogenesis and/or progression of cancer. Evidence is presented that certain kallikreins may be exploited as diagnostic cancer biomarkers. Although the function(s) of novel kallikreins is currently unknown, increasing evidence suggests that kallikreins may participate in regulatory enzymatic cascade(s). Elucidation of the function of novel kallikreins largely depends on the availability of active recombinant proteins. Here, the zymogen for kallikrein 13 was overexpressed in Pichia pastoris and biochemically characterized. It was shown that the kallikrein 13 zymogen displays intrinsic catalytic activity leading to autoactivation. A clipped form of kallikrein 13 was identified, indicating autocatalytic cleavage at the internal bond R114-S115. Mature kallikrein 13 displays trypsin-like activity with restricted specificity on synthetic and protein substrates. Combinatorial P1-Lys libraries of tetrapeptide fluorogenic substrates were synthesized and used for the profiling of the P2 specificity of selected kallikreins. Interestingly, it was shown that human kallikrein 13, similarly to PSA, could specifically cleave human plasminogen to generate angiostatin-like fragments, suggesting that specific kallikreins may have antiangiogenic actions. An understanding of the physiology of human kallikreins is emerging with potential clinical applications.

KLK14 (formerly known as KLK-L6) is a recently identified member of the human kallikrein gene family. This family harbours several genes aberrantly expressed in various cancers as well as established (PSA/hK3, hK2) and potential (hK6, hK10) cancer markers. Similar to other kallikrein genes, KLK14 was found to be regulated by steroid hormones, particularly androgens and progestins, in breast and ovarian cancer cell lines. Preliminary studies indicated that KLK14 is differentially expressed in breast, ovarian, prostatic and testicular tumours. Given the above, we determined the prognostic significance of KLK14 expression in breast cancer. We studied KLK14 expression in 178 histologically confirmed epithelial breast carcinomas by quantitative reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction and correlated with clinicopathological variables (tumour stage, grade, histotype etc.) and with outcome (disease-free survival and overall survival), monitored over a median of 76 months. KLK14 mRNA levels ranged from 0 to 1,219 arbitrary units in breast cancer tissues, with a mean+/-s.e. of 136+/-22. An optimal cutoff value of 40.5 arbitrary units was selected, to categorise tumours as KLK14-positive or negative. Higher concentrations of KLK14 mRNA were more frequently found in patients with advanced stage (III) disease (P=0.032). No statistically significant association was found between KLK14 and the other clinicopathological variables. KLK14 overexpression was found to be a significant predictor of decreased disease-free survival (hazard ratio of 2.31, P=0.001) and overall survival (hazard ratio of 2.21, P=0.005). Cox multivariate analysis indicated that KLK14 was an independent prognostic indicator of disease-free survival and overall survival. KLK14 also has independent prognostic value in subgroups of patients with a tumour size </=2 cm and positive nodal, oestrogen receptor and progestin receptor status. We conclude that KLK14 expression, as assessed by quantitative reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction, is an independent marker of unfavourable prognosis for breast cancer.

Human tissue kallikreins (KLKs) are attracting increased attention due to their role as biomarkers for the screening, diagnosis, prognosis, and monitoring of various cancers including those of the prostate, ovarian, breast, testicular, and lung. Human tissue kallikrein genes represent the largest contiguous group of proteases within the human genome. Originally thought to consist of three genes, the identification of the human kallikrein locus has expanded this number to fifteen. These genes, and their encoded proteins, share a high degree of homology and are expressed in different tissues. Prostate-specific antigen (PSA), the most commonly known kallikrein, is a useful biomarker for prostate cancer. Several other kallikreins, including kallikreins 2 (KLK2) and 11 (KLK11) are emerging as complementary prostate cancer biomarkers. Along with these kallikreins, several others have been implicated in the other cancers. For example, KLK5, 6, 7, 10, 11, and 14 are emerging biomarkers for ovarian cancer. The identification of kallikrein substrates and the development of proteolytic cascade models implicate kallikrein proteins in cancer progression. This review describes the current status of kallikreins as cancer biomarkers.

Early diagnosis of cancer and early detection of relapse following surgery are critical for the effective treatment of the disease and for a positive clinical outcome. Identification of novel diagnostic, prognostic and predictive biomarkers will contribute utmost to clinical decision-making. The human tissue kallikrein and kallikrein-related peptidases (KLKs), encoded by the largest contiguous cluster of protease genes in the human genome, are secreted serine proteases with diverse expression patterns and physiological roles. The aberrant expression of KLKs in various malignancies as well as their involvement in many cancer-related processes, such as cell growth regulation, angiogenesis, invasion, and metastasis, has prompted scientists to investigate their potential as cancer biomarkers. Expression of distinct KLKs is associated with clinicopathological parameters of cancer patients. Moreover, several KLKs possess significant favorable or unfavorable prognostic value in various malignancies, with prostate-specific antigen (PSA) being the most widely used biomarker in clinical practice, today. KLKs are also considered as very promising biomarkers for cancer personalized medicine, especially for prediction and monitoring of patients' response to chemotherapy, therefore opening up new horizons towards effective patient monitoring post-treatment. This review describes the current status of KLKs as tumor biomarkers.

Human tissue kallikreins (hKs), which are encoded by the largest contiguous cluster of protease genes in the human genome, are secreted serine proteases with diverse expression patterns and physiological roles. Although primarily known for their clinical applicability as cancer biomarkers, recent evidence implicates hKs in many cancer-related processes, including cell-growth regulation, angiogenesis, invasion and metastasis. They have been shown to promote or inhibit neoplastic progression, acting individually and/or in cascades with other hKs and proteases, and might represent attractive targets for therapeutic intervention.

microRNAs (miRNAs) are a recently discovered class of small non-coding RNAs that regulate gene expression. Rapidly accumulating evidence has revealed that miRNAs are associated with cancer. The human tissue kallikrein gene family is the largest contiguous family of proteases in the human genome, containing 15 genes. Many kallikreins have been reported as potential tumor markers. In this review, recent bioinformatics and experimental evidence is presented indicating that kallikreins are potential miRNA targets. The available experimental approaches to investigate these interactions and the potential diagnostic and therapeutic applications are also discussed. miRNAs represent a possible regulatory mechanism for controlling kallikrein expression at the post-transcriptional level. Many miRNAs were predicted to target kallikreins and a single miRNA can target more than one kallikrein. Recent evidence suggests that miRNAs can also exert 'quantitative' control of kallikreins by utilizing multiple targeting sites in the kallikrein mRNA. More research is needed to experimentally verify the in silico predictions and to investigate the possible role in tumor initiation and/or progression.

Recent evidence suggests that many members of the human kallikrein gene family are differentially regulated in breast cancer and other endocrine-related malignancies. In this study, we utilised the serial analysis of gene expression (SAGE) and expressed sequence tag (EST) databases of the Cancer Genome Anatomy Project (CGAP) to perform in silico analyses of the expression pattern of the 15 human kallikrein genes in normal and cancerous breast tissues and cell lines using different analytical tools such as Virtual Northern blotting, Digital Differential Display and X-profiler. Our results indicate that at least four kallikrein genes (KLK5, 6, 8, 10) are downregulated in breast cancer. Probing eight normal and 24 breast cancer SAGE libraries with gene-specific tags for each of the above kallikreins indicated moderate-to-high expression densities in normal breast (27-319 tags per million; tpm, in two to five out of eight libraries), compared to no or low expression (0 - 34 tpm in zero to two libraries out of 24) in breast cancer. These data were verified by screening the EST databases, where all mRNA clones isolated for these genes, except for one in each, were from normal breast libraries, with no clones detected from breast cancer tissues or cell lines (with the exception of KLK8). X-profiler comparison of two pools of normal and breast cancer libraries further verified the presence of significant downregulation of expression levels of 4 of the kallikreins genes (KLK5, 6, 10, 12). We experimentally verified the downregulation of these four kallikreins (KLK5, 6, 8, 10 and 12) by RT - PCR analysis.

Kallikrein gene families have been identified previously in genomes of the human, the mouse, and the rat, and individual kallikrein-like genes have been found in many more species. This study presents the in silico identification of kallikrein gene families in the recently sequenced genomes of four additional mammalian species, the chimpanzee, the dog, the pig, and the opossum. Phylogenies were constructed with gene sequences from all seven mammalian families, using Bayesian analysis, which clarified the evolutionary relationships between these genes. Individual gene sequences, as well as concatenated constructs of multiple sequences, were used. Fifteen kallikrein genes were located in the chimpanzee (Pan troglodytes) genome, while only 14 were identified in the canine (Canis familiaris) genome as no orthologue to human KLK3 was found. Thirteen genes were identified from the pig (Sus scrofa) genome, which lacked homologues to KLK2 and KLK3, and 11 genes, orthologous to human KLK5 through KLK15, were found in the opossum (Monodelphis domestica) genome. No kallikrein genes were identified from the available genome sequences of the chicken (Gallus gallus) or African clawed frog (Xenopus tropicalis). Within the family of kallikreins several subfamilies were suggested by phylogenetic analysis. One consisted of KLK4, KLK5, and KLK14; another of KLK9, KLK11, and KLK15; a third of KLK10 and KLK12; a fourth of KLK6 and KLK13; and finally one of KLK8 and the classical kallikreins (KLK1, KLK2, and KLK3).

Kallikrein-related peptidases (KLKs) are a family of serine proteases that have been shown to be dysregulated in several malignancies including ovarian cancer. The control of kallikrein genes and their physiological function in cancer is not well understood. We hypothesized that microRNAs (miRNAs) represent a novel mechanism for post-transcriptional control of KLK expression in cancer. We first analysed miRNA expression in ovarian cancer in silico. A total of 98 miRNAs were reported to have altered expression in ovarian cancer. Three of these miRNAs were predicted to target KLK10. We experimentally verified the predicted miR-KLK10 interaction using two independent techniques, a luciferase assay with a construct containing the KLK10 3' untranslated region (UTR), pMIR-KLK10, and measuring KLK10 protein levels after transfection with miRNA. When we co-transfected cells with pMIR-KLK10 and either let-7f, miR-224, or mR-516a, we saw decreased luciferase signal, suggesting that these miRNAs can target KLK10. We then examined the effect of these three miRNAs on KLK10 protein expression and cell growth. Transfection of all miRNAs, let-7f, miR-224, and miR-516a led to a decrease in protein expression and cellular growth. This effect was shown to be dose dependent. The KLK10 protein levels were partially restored by co-transfecting let-7f and its inhibitor. In addition, there was a slight decrease in KLK10 mRNA expression after transfection with let-7f. Our results confirm that KLKs can be targeted by more than one miRNA. Increased expression of certain miRNAs in ovarian cancer can lead to decreased KLK protein expression and subsequently have a negative effect on cell proliferation. This dose-dependent effect suggests that a 'tweaking' or 'fine-tuning' mechanism exists in which the expression of one KLK can be controlled by multiple miRNAs. These data together suggest that miRNA may be used as potential therapeutic options and further studies are required.

The 15 members of the kallikrein-related serine peptidase (KLK) family have diverse tissue-specific expression profiles and putative proteolytic functions. The kallikrein family is also emerging as a rich source of disease biomarkers with KLK3, commonly known as prostate-specific antigen, being the current serum biomarker for prostate cancer. The kallikrein locus is also notable because it is extraordinarily responsive to steroids and other hormones. Indeed, at least 14 functional hormone response elements have been identified in the kallikrein locus. A more comprehensive understanding of the transcriptional regulation of kallikreins may help the field make more informed hypotheses about the physiological functions of kallikreins and their effectiveness as biomarkers. In this review, we describe the organization of the kallikrein locus and the structure of kallikrein genes and proteins. We also focus on the transcriptional regulation of kallikreins by androgens, progestins, glucocorticoids, mineralocorticoids, estrogens, and other hormones in animal models and human prostate, breast, and reproductive tract tissues. The interaction of the androgen receptor with androgen response elements in the promoter and enhancer of KLK2 and KLK3 is also summarized in detail. There is evidence that all kallikreins are regulated by multiple nuclear receptors. Yet, apart from KLK2 and KLK3, it is not clear whether all kallikreins are direct transcriptional targets. Therefore, we argue that gaining more detailed information about the mechanisms that regulate kallikrein expression should be a priority of future studies and that the kallikrein locus will continue to be an important model in the era of genome-wide analyses.

The human tissue Kallikrein family consists of 15 genes with the majority shown to be differentially expressed in cancers and/or indicators of cancer prognosis. We sought to elucidate the role of common genetic variation in four of the Kallikrein genes, KLK5, KLK6, KLK12, and KLK13, in prostate cancer risk and tumor aggressiveness. Genotyping of all 22 tagging single nucleotide polymorphisms (tagSNPs) in the KLK5, KLK6, KLK12, and KLK13 genes was performed in approximately 1,000 prostate cancer cases and 1,300 male controls from Australia. Data from any positive results were also accessed for 1,844 cases and 1,886 controls from a previously published prostate cancer genome-wide association study set from the United Kingdom. For one SNP in KLK12, rs3865443, there was evidence for association with prostate cancer risk of similar direction and magnitude in the replication set to that seen in the Australian cohort. We conducted genotyping of a further 309 prostate cancer cases, and combined analyses revealed an increased risk of prostate cancer for carriers of the rare homozygous genotype for rs3865443 (OR 1.28, 95% CI 1.04-1.57; P = 0.018). No other tagSNPs in the KLK5, KLK6, and KLK13 genes were consistently associated with prostate cancer risk or tumor aggressiveness. Analysis of a combined sample of 3,153 cases and 3,199 controls revealed the KLK12 tagSNP rs3865443 to be marginally statistically significantly associated with risk of prostate cancer. Considering the total number of SNPs investigated in this study, this finding should be interpreted cautiously and requires additional validation from very large datasets such as those of the Prostate Cancer Association group to investigate cancer associated alterations (PRACTICAL) Consortium.

Kallikreins belong to a family of serine proteases that are widespread throughout living organisms, expressed in diverse tissue-specific patterns, and known to have highly diverse physiological functions. The 15 human and 24 mouse kallikreins have been implicated in pathophysiology of brain, kidney, and respiratory and reproductive systems and often are used as cancer biomarkers. To better elucidate the structure and evolutionary origin of this important gene family in the pig, we have constructed a contiguous BAC clone-derived physical map of the porcine kallikrein gene region and have fully sequenced a BAC clone containing 13 kallikrein genes, 11 of which are novel. Radiation hybrid mapping assigns this kallikrein-gene-rich region to porcine chromosome 6. Phylogenetic and percent identity plot-based analyses revealed strong structure and order conservation of kallikreins among four mammalian species. Reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction-based expression analysis of porcine kallikreins showed a complex expression pattern across different tissues with the thymus being the only tissue expressing all 13 kallikrein genes. [The sequence data described in this paper has been submitted to GenBank under Accession No. AC149292].

The tissue kallikrein (KLK) family contains 15 genes (KLK1-KLK15) tandemly arranged on chromosome 19q13.4 that forms the largest cluster of contiguous protease genes in the human genome. Here, we provide mechanistic evidence showing that the expression of KLK13, one of the most recently identified family members, is significantly up-regulated in metastatic lung adenocarcinoma. Whilst overexpression of KLK13 resulted in an increase in malignant cell behavior, knockdown of its endogenous gene expression caused a significant decrease in cell migratory and invasive properties. Functional studies further demonstrated that KLK13 is activated via demethylation of its upstream region. The elevated KLK13 protein then enhances the ability of tumor cells to degrade extracellular laminin that, subsequently, facilitates cell metastatic potential in the in vivo SCID mouse xenograft model. KLK13 was also found to induce the expression of N-cadherin to help promote tumor cell motility. Together, these results reveal the enhancing effects of KLK13 on tumor cell invasion and migration, and that it may serve as a diagnostic/prognostic marker and a potential therapeutic target for lung cancer.

The human kallikrein gene family consists of 15 serine proteases. We examined the expression of the kallikrein genes in human cerebral cortex and hippocampus by RT-PCR and compared their expression between Alzheimer's disease (AD) and control tissue. KLK1, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 10, 11, 13 and 14 are expressed in both cerebral cortex and hippocampus. KLK9 is expressed in cortex but not hippocampus, whereas KLK2, 3, 12 and 15 are not expressed in either tissue. We demonstrate an 11.5-fold increase in KLK8 mRNA levels in AD hippocampus compared to controls. The KLK8 gene product, neuropsin, processes extracellular matrix and is important for neuronal plasticity. Therefore, the increase in KLK8 could have detrimental effects on hippocampal function in AD.

Tissue kallikreins are members of the S1 family (clan SA) of trypsin-like serine proteases and are present in at least six mammalian orders. In humans, tissue kallikreins (hK) are encoded by 15 structurally similar, steroid hormone-regulated genes (KLK) that colocalize to chromosome 19q13.4, representing the largest cluster of contiguous protease genes in the entire genome. hKs are widely expressed in diverse tissues and implicated in a range of normal physiologic functions from the regulation of blood pressure and electrolyte balance to tissue remodeling, prohormone processing, neural plasticity, and skin desquamation. Several lines of evidence suggest that hKs may be involved in cascade reactions and that cross-talk may exist with proteases of other catalytic classes. The proteolytic activity of hKs is regulated in several ways including zymogen activation, endogenous inhibitors, such as serpins, and via internal (auto)cleavage leading to inactivation. Dysregulated hK expression is associated with multiple diseases, primarily cancer. As a consequence, many kallikreins, in addition to hK3/PSA, have been identified as promising diagnostic and/or prognostic biomarkers for several cancer types, including ovarian, breast, and prostate. Recent data also suggest that hKs may be causally involved in carcinogenesis, particularly in tumor metastasis and invasion, and, thus, may represent attractive drug targets to consider for therapeutic intervention.

The cDNA for the trypsin-like serine protease gene (TLSP, HGMW-approved symbol PRSS20) has been recently identified. TLSP is expressed in brain and skin tissues but little else is known about this new serine protease gene. In this paper, we describe the complete genomic organization and precise mapping of the TLSP gene. This gene spans 5.3 kb of genomic sequence on chromosome 19q13.3-q13. 4. The gene consists of six exons, the first of which is untranslated. All splice junctions follow the GT/AG rule, and the intron phases are identical to those of other kallikrein-like genes, including zyme (PRSS9), NES1 (PRSSL1), and neuropsin (PRSS19). Fine-mapping of the area indicates that TLSP lies downstream from the PSA, zyme, neuropsin, and NES1 genes. Significant sequence homologies were found between TLSP and other human kallikreins. Furthermore, there is conservation of the catalytic triad (histidine, aspartic acid, serine) and of the number of coding exons (five; the same in all members of the kallikrein gene family). We thus suggest that TLSP is a new member of the human kallikrein gene family. TLSP is expressed in many tissues including cerebellum, prostate, salivary glands, stomach, lung, thymus, small intestine, spleen, liver, and uterus. TLSP expression appears to be regulated by steroid hormones in the breast carcinoma cell line BT-474.

The glandular kallikrein family is composed of structurally related serine proteases. Studies show that the mouse family encompasses at least 14 highly conserved functional genes, but of these only the tissue kallikarein has a human ortholog. In man, the tissue kallikrein display high sequence similarity with prostate specific antigen and human glandular kallikrein 2, suggesting that they evolved after the separation of primates and rodents. A phylogenetic study of the genes encoding glandular kallikreins in species evolutionarily located between rodents and man may reveal interesting details on how the gene family evolved, which in turn could yield information about the function of the proteins. Therefore, we have initiated a study of the glandular kallikreins of the cotton-top tamarin (Saguinus oedipus), a New World Monkey. Here, we report the cloning and nucleotide sequence of one of these, the tissue kallikrein gene. The gene of 4.4 kb is composed of five exons, and the structure is 90% similar to that of the orthologous human gene. It gives rise to a polypeptide of 261 amino acids, including a signal peptide of 17 residues, a pro-piece of 7 residues, and the mature protein of 237 residues with an estimated molecular mass of 26.3 kD. The similarity to the human prostate specific antigen and human glandular kallikrein 2 genes is 73% and 72%, respectively, including introns and flanking regions. The lower similarity to these genes compared with the human tissue kallikrein gene indicates that they, or a progenitor to them, arose in primates prior to the separation of New and Old World monkeys. Genomic Southern blots also show that the cotton-top tamarin genome encompasses at least one more glandular kallikrein gene.

The tissue kallikrein gene family consists of 15 genes tandemly arranged on human chromosome 19q13.4. Most kallikrein genes are characterized by aberrant expression patterns in various human cancers, a feature that makes them ideal cancer biomarkers. In the present study, we investigated the effect of the epigenetic drug compound 5-aza-2'-deoxycytidine on the expression of downregulated kallikrein genes in prostate, breast, and ovarian cancer cell lines. Reactivation of multiple kallikrein genes was observed, although some of these genes do not contain CpG islands in their genomic sequence. Epigenetic regulation provides a new mechanism for the pharmacological modulation of kallikreins in human cancers with putative therapeutic implications.

Tissue kallikreins are a group of closely related serine proteinases that are represented by multigene families in mice and rats. The existence of similar, large, kallikrein-like gene families in other mammalian species is currently a matter of dispute. We have surveyed a number of vertebrate species using genomic DNA Southern blotting and screened a human genomic library with a monkey kallikrein cDNA probe. The hybridization patterns of the genomic Southern blots and the characterization of 19 independent human clones using restriction analysis and Southern blotting indicate that other mammalian species may have multiple kallikrein-like genes as well. The regulatory mechanisms that govern the expression, activity, and bioavailability of tissue kallikreins are likewise complex. At the level of transcription, hormones, dietary factors, and tissue-specific factors are known to affect the expression of tissue kallikrein genes. At the posttranslational level, kallikrein activity and bioavailability are regulated by enzymatic activation, circulating autoantibodies, and binding proteins. We have demonstrated the presence of kallikrein-binding proteins in humans and rats, and, furthermore, we have shown reduced levels of this binding protein in a hypertensive rat model.

Comparisons of the glandular kallikreins loci in human, mouse and rat revealed remarkable differences. For example, the mouse and the rat lack the genes encoding prostate-specific antigen (PSA) and human glandular kallikrein 2 (hK2). In contrast, the intergenic region between KLK1 and KLK15 is devoid of genes and spans only 1.5 kb in humans, but encompasses 23 KLK1-like genes spanning 290 kb in the mouse. To further elucidate the evolution of glandular kallikrein genes, we investigated the structure and organization of these genes in the cotton-top tamarin (Saguinus oedipus), a New World monkey. We conclude that this species has no PSA gene. Moreover, the ortholog of the hK2 gene is a pseudogene, as it contains several mutations that preclude formation of a functional serine protease. The expression of this gene was probably silenced by a 15-bp deletion observed in an androgen response element in the upstream promoter region. Replacing the deleted base pairs in vitro with nucleotides from the human counterpart dramatically restored the transcriptional activity to a level that even surpassed that of the human ortholog. We also determined the nucleotide sequence of KLK15 and the intergenic region between this gene and KLK1 in the cotton-top tamarin. The region between KLK1 and KLK15 is conserved between the cotton-top tamarin and humans, and there are no signs of the extension seen in the mouse. KLK15 appeared to be functional, thus, we predict that it generates a protease with specificity similar to that of the human ortholog.

Several single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) genome-wide association studies (GWASs) have been completed in multiple sclerosis (MS). Follow-up studies of the variants with the most promising rankings, especially when supplemented by informed candidate gene selection, have proven to be extremely successful. In this study we report the results of a multi-stage replication analysis of the putatively associated SNPs identified in the Wellcome Trust Case Control Consortium non-synonymous SNP (nsSNP) screen. In total, the replication sample consisted of 3444 patients and 2595 controls. A combined analysis of the nsSNP screen and replication data provides evidence implicating a novel additional locus, rs3748816 in membrane metalloendopeptidase-like 1 (MMEL1; odds ratio=1.16, P=3.54 × 10⁻⁶) in MS susceptibility.

Seminal fluid proteins show striking effects on reproduction, involving manipulation of female behavior and physiology, mechanisms of sperm competition, and pathogen defense. Strong adaptive pressures are expected for such manifestations of sexual selection and host defense, but the extent of positive selection in seminal fluid proteins from divergent taxa is unknown. We identified adaptive evolution in primate seminal proteins using genomic resources in a tissue-specific study. We found extensive signatures of positive selection when comparing 161 human seminal fluid proteins and 2,858 prostate-expressed genes to those in chimpanzee. Seven of eight outstanding genes yielded statistically significant evidence of positive selection when analyzed in divergent primates. Functional clues were gained through divergent analysis, including several cases of species-specific loss of function in copulatory plug genes, and statistically significant spatial clustering of positively selected sites near the active site of kallikrein 2. This study reveals previously unidentified positive selection in seven primate seminal proteins, and when considered with findings in Drosophila, indicates that extensive positive selection is found in seminal fluid across divergent taxonomic groups.

Many kallikrein genes were found to be differentially expressed in various malignancies, and prostate specific antigen (encoded by the KLK3 gene) is the best tumour marker for prostate cancer. Prostate specific antigen has recently been shown to be an independent favourable prognostic marker for breast cancer. KLK15 is newly discovered kallikrein gene that is located adjacent to KLK3 on chromosome 19q13.4. KLK15 has 41% similarity to KLK3 and the encoded protein, hK15, can activate pro-prostate specific antigen. We studied the expression of KLK15 by real-time quantitative reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction in 202 tissues from patients with breast carcinoma of various stages, grades and histological types. KLK15 expression was found to be a significant predictor of progression-free survival (hazard ratio of 0.41 and P=0.011) and overall survival (hazard ratio of 0.34 and P=0.009). When all other known confounders were controlled in the multivariate analysis, KLK15 retained its prognostic significance. Higher concentrations of KLK15 mRNA were found more frequently in node negative patients (P=0.042). No association was found between KLK15 expression and any other clinicopathological variable. Further, KLK15 is an independent prognostic factor of progression-free survival and overall survival in the subgroup of patients with lower grade and those with oestrogen receptor and progesterone receptor negative tumours in both univariate and multivariate analysis. KLK15 levels of expression were slightly higher (although not statistically significant) in the oestrogen receptor negative and progesterone receptor negative subgroups of patients. KLK15 is up-regulated by androgens in breast cancer cell lines. Time-course and blocking experiments suggest that this regulation is mediated through the androgen receptor.

The tissue kallikreins are serine proteases encoded by highly conserved multi-gene families. The rodent kallikrein (KLK) families are particularly large, consisting of 13-26 genes clustered in one chromosomal locus. It has been recently recognised that the human KLK gene family is of a similar size (15 genes) with the identification of another 12 related genes (KLK4-KLK15) within and adjacent to the original human KLK locus (KLK1-3) on chromosome 19q13.4. The structural organisation and size of these new genes is similar to that of other KLK genes except for additional exons encoding 5' or 3' untranslated regions. Moreover, many of these genes have multiple mRNA transcripts, a trait not observed with rodent genes. Unlike all other kallikreins, the KLK4-KLK15 encoded proteases are less related (25-44%) and do not contain a conventional kallikrein loop. Clusters of genes exhibit high prostatic (KLK2-4, KLK15) or pancreatic (KLK6-13) expression, suggesting evolutionary conservation of elements conferring tissue specificity. These genes are also expressed, to varying degrees, in a wider range of tissues suggesting a functional involvement of these newer human kallikrein proteases in a diverse range of physiological processes.

The human tissue kallikrein family of serine proteases (hK1-hK15 encoded by the genes KLK1-KLK15) is involved in several cancer-related processes. Accumulating evidence suggests that certain tissue kallikreins are part of an enzymatic cascade pathway that is activated in ovarian cancer and other malignant diseases. In the present study, OV-MZ-6 ovarian cancer cells were stably co-transfected with plasmids expressing hK4, hK5, hK6, and hK7. These cells displayed similar proliferative capacity as the vector-transfected control cells (which do not express any of the four tissue kallikreins), but showed significantly increased invasive behavior in an in vitro Matrigel invasion assay (p<0.01; Mann-Whitney U-test). For in vivo analysis, the cancer cells were inoculated into the peritoneum of nude mice. Simultaneous expression of hK4, hK5, hK6, and hK7 resulted in a remarkable 92% mean increase in tumor burden compared to the vector-control cell line. Five out of 14 mice in the 'tissue kallikrein overexpressing' group displayed a tumor/situs ratio greater than 0.198, while this weight limit was not exceeded at all in the vector control group consisting of 13 mice (p=0.017; chi2 test). Our results strongly support the view that tumor-associated overexpression of tissue kallikreins contributes to ovarian cancer progression.

Tissue kallikreins are a group of serine proteases that are found in many organs and biologic fluids. Tissue kallikrein genes (KLKs) are found on chromosome 19q13.3-4 as a gene cluster encoding 15 different serine proteases. In skin, two tissue kallikrein proteins, hK5 and hK7, are expressed in the stratum corneum and are known to be involved in desquamation of corneocytes. The possible involvement of other kallikrein proteins has not been clarified, however, nor has the significance of each member in the serine protease activity of skin been delineated. In the study described here, we examined expression and localization of KLK mRNA in normal human skin by means of RT-PCR and in situ hybridization. Quantitative RT-PCR analysis showed abundant expression of KLK1 and KLK11 mRNA, moderate expression of KLK4, KLK5, KLK6, KLK7, and KLK13 mRNA, and low expression of KLK8 mRNA in normal human skin. For KLK4, KLK8, and KLK13 mRNA, splice variants were identified to be their major mRNA species. Two variants for KLK13 mRNA were novel. The amount of the serine protease inhibitor Kazal-type 5 (SPINK5) mRNA was comparable to KLK1 and KLK11 mRNA. In situ hybridization revealed intense expression of all KLK mRNA studied except KLK12 mRNA in the stratum granulosum of normal epidermis, where SPINK5 mRNA coexisted. Excluding KLK13 mRNA, they are also expressed in hair sheath, eccrine sweat glands, and sebaceous glands. Coexpression of various KLK and SPINK5 mRNA suggests that their proteins are the candidates to balance and maintain serine protease activities in both the skin and appendages.

Recent evidence suggests that many members of the human kallikrein (KLK) gene family are differentially regulated in ovarian cancer and have potential as diagnostic and/or prognostic markers. We used the serial analysis of gene expression and expressed sequence tag databases of the Cancer Genome Anatomy Project to perform in silico analyses of the expression pattern of the 15 human KLK genes in normal and cancerous ovarian tissues and cell lines. We found that seven KLK genes (KLK5, KLK6, KLK7, KLK8, KLK10, KLK11, and KLK14) are up-regulated in ovarian cancer. Probing 2 normal and 10 ovarian cancer serial analysis of gene expression libraries with gene-specific tags for each KLK indicated that whereas no expression was detected in any normal libraries (with the exception of KLK10 and KLK11), these KLKs were found to be expressed with moderate densities (103-408 tags per million) in 40-60% of the ovarian cancer libraries analyzed. These data were verified by screening the expressed sequence tag databases, where 78 of 79 mRNA clones isolated for these genes were from ovarian cancer libraries. X-profiler comparison of the pools of normal and cancerous ovaries identified a significant difference in expression levels for six of the seven KLKs. We experimentally verified the overexpression of six KLK proteins in cancer versus normal or benign tissues with highly sensitive and specific immunofluorometric assays. A statistically significant stepwise increase in protein levels was found among normal, benign, and cancerous ovarian tissues. The expression of five KLKs showed a strong degree of correlation at the protein level, suggesting the existence of a common mechanism or pathway that controls the expression of this group of adjacent genes during ovarian cancer progression.

Minisatellites are repetitive sequences of DNA that are present throughout the genome. Although the origin and function of these minisatellites is still unknown, they found clinical applications as markers of many diseases, including cancer. Also, they are useful tools for DNA fingerprinting and linkage analysis. Kallikreins are serine proteases that appear to be involved in many diseases including brain disorders and malignancy. We have recently characterized the human kallikrein gene locus on chromosome 19q13.4, which includes 15 kallikrein genes. In this study, we examined the kallikrein locus ( approximately 300 Kb) for all known repeat elements. About 50% of this genomic area is occupied by different repeat elements. We also identified unique minisatellite elements that are restricted to chromosome 19q13. Ten clusters of these minisatellites are distributed along the locus on either DNA strand. The clusters are located in the promoters and enhancers of genes, in introns, and in untranslated regions of the mRNA. Analysis of these elements indicates that they are polymorphic, thus they can be useful in linkage analysis and DNA fingerprinting. Our preliminary results indicate also that the distribution of the different alleles of these minisatellites might be associated with malignancy.
