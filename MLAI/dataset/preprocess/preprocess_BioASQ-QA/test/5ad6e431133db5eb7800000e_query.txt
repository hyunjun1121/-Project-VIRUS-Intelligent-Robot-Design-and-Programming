Multiple sclerosis (MS) is a disease of young and middle aged individuals with a demyelinative axonal damage nature in central nervous system that causes various signs and symptoms. As color vision needs normal function of optic nerve and macula, it is proposed that MS can alter it via influencing optic nerve. In this survey, we evaluated color vision abnormalities and its relationship with history of optic neuritis and abnormal visual evoked potentials (VEPs) among MS patients. The case group was included of clinically definitive MS patients and the same number of normal population was enrolled as the control group. Color vision of all the participants was evaluated by Ishihara test and then visual evoked potential (VEPs) and history of optic neuritis (ON) was assessed among them. Then, frequency of color blindness was compared between the case and the control group. Finally, color blinded patients were compared to those with the history of ON and abnormal VEPs. 63 MS patients and the same number of normal populations were enrolled in this study. 12 patients had color blindness based on the Ishihara test; only 3 of them were among the control group, which showed a significant different between the two groups (P = 0.013). There was a significant relationship between the color blindness and abnormal VEP (R = 0.53, P = 0.023) but not for the color blindness and ON (P = 0.67). This study demonstrates a significant correlation between color blindness and multiple sclerosis including ones with abnormal prolonged VEP latencies. Therefore, in individuals with acquired color vision impairment, an evaluation for potentially serious underlying diseases like MS is essential.

The incidence of red-green colour vision defects was studied in a sample of 392 Basque students (174 males and 218 females), using the Ishihara test cards (1987). The frequency of red-green colour blindness was 4.02 percent in the males and 0.46 percent in the females. The colour blindness frequencies found among males are within the range of other Spanish samples. Nevertheless they are lower than the values reported in other European populations.

To determine whether colour blindness affects batting in professional cricketers. Comparison of batting averages of colour blind cricketers and those with normal vision. Players on 18 first class county cricket teams. 280 of 306 players were tested. Results of Isihara colour blindness tests. Batting average for the colour blind group (12 players) was slightly lower than for players with normal vision (20.88 v 26.31). There was no difference in the number of batsmen and bowlers affected. Batting averages before and after the introduction of the white ball into Sunday League cricket did not differ significantly. That batting performance is not significantly impaired by colour blindness suggests that to some extent these players are self selected. Routine testing of cricketers for colour blindness is not recommended.

Vision screening tests within the limits of industrial medicine examinations, together with physical examinations, were done on human individuals by means of pseudo-isochromatic charts in order to detect "red-green blindness". The tests were carried out on 1589 individuals (males and females) from 10 medium-scale plants of the Saarbr√ºcken area (Federal Republic of Germany). The results obtained from male individuals by 919 Ishihara-tests were only considered, categorized and graphically represented according to their age groups. The data have been collected from the cases examined mostly between the years 1976 to 1977. About 1500 cases were examined per year. Because the samples were not selected at random, one has to be cautious with regard to the statistical interpretations of the results. However, due to the large number of cases included in the study, it can be statistically represented. The histogram illustrating the distribution of colour-vision deficiency, according to each age group, shows the highest peak at an age range of 30 to 35 years. This indicates that a considerable number of cases with colour-vision deficiency was discovered late. The individuals have to be early examined by school physicians, house physicians, occupational physicians, internists or ophthalmologists with this colour-vision screening test, before they enter professional life. Some symptomatical complexes of internal diseases and human genetics, i.e. related to "colour-vision blindness" are also emphasized hemophilia and hemolytic anemia due to glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase deficiency.

Color-blindness is the inability to perceive differences between some color that other people can distinguish. Using a literature search, the results indicate the prevalence of color vision deficiency in the medical profession and its on medical skills. Medical laboratory technicians and technologists employees should also screen for color blindness. This research aimed to study color blindness prevalence among Hospitals' Clinical Laboratories' Employees and Students in Tehran University of Medical Sciences (TUMS). A cross-sectional descriptive and analytical study was conducted among 633 TUMS Clinical Laboratory Sciences' Students and Hospitals' Clinical Laboratories' Employees to detect color-blindness problems by Ishihara Test. The tests were first screened with certain pictures, then compared to the Ishihara criteria to be possible color defective were tested further with other plates to determine color - blindness defects. The data was saved using with SPSS software and analyzed by statistical methods. This is the first study to determine the prevalence of color - blindness in Clinical Laboratory Sciences' Students and Employees. 2.4% of TUMS Medical Laboratory Sciences Students and Hospitals' Clinical Laboratories' Employees are color-blind. There is significant correlation between color-blindness and sex and age. But the results showed that there is not significant correlation between color-blindness defect and exposure to chemical agents, type of job, trauma and surgery history, history of familial defect and race. It would be a wide range of difficulties by color blinded students and employees in their practice of laboratory diagnosis and techniques with a potentially of errors. We suggest color blindness as a medical conditions should restrict employment choices for medical laboratory technicians and technologists job in Iran.
