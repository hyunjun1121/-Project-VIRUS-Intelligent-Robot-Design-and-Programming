What is the cause of Tardive dyskinesia?

[PMID: 26979525]
Free radicals may be involved in the pathogenesis of tardive dyskinesia (TD). We conducted this meta-analysis to systematically examine the efficacy of extract of Ginkgo biloba (EGb), a potent antioxidant possessing free radical-scavenging properties, as a treatment for TD in schizophrenia using randomized controlled trial (RCT) data. Drawn from English and Chinese databases, 3 RCTs of EGb augmentation of antipsychotics (APs) vs. AP plus placebo or AP monotherapy were identified. 2 evaluators extracted data. The primary outcome measure was the severity of TD symptoms assessed by the Abnormal Involuntary Movement Scale (AIMS). Weighted mean difference (WMD) and risk ratio (RR) ±95% confidence intervals (CI) were calculated. Statistical analyses were performed using Review Manager (version 5.1.7.0) and STATA (version 12.0). The 3 RCTs (n=299) from China, of 12 weeks duration, involved schizophrenia patients with TD of 55.9±13.4 years old. EGb (240 mg/day) outperformed the control group in reducing the severity of TD and clinical symptoms as measured by the AIMS (trials=3, n=299, WMD: -2.30 (95%CI: - 3.04, -1.55), P<0.00001) and the adverse drug reactions as assessed by the Treatment Emergent Symptom Scale (TESS) (trials=2, n=142, WMD: -2.38 (95%CI: -4.01, -0.74), P=0.004). Both the Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale (PANSS) total score (trials=2, n=239, P=0.87) and all-cause discontinuation (trials=3, n=299, P=0.21) were similar between the EGb and control group. This meta-analysis suggests that adjunctive EGb appeared to be an effective and safe option for improving TD in the treatment of schizophrenia patients. However, better RCTs are needed to demonstrate its efficacy and safety especially on cognitive function in TD. CRD42015024930.

The objective of this report is to draw attention to tardive dyskinesia (TD) caused by aripiprazole, a third generation antipsychotic. TD has been traditionally attributed to typical (first-generation) antipsychotics, but other dopamine receptor blocking drugs and atypical (second- and third-generation) neuroleptics are emerging as an important cause of TD. We reviewed the medical records of patients with TD seen at the Baylor College of Medicine Movement Disorders Clinic between 2002 and 2010 to identify patients with TD associated with aripiprazole. Among 236 patients with TD seen over the specified period, 8 (3.4%) were found to have aripiprazole-associated TD. In 5 patients, TD occurred after exclusive exposure to aripiprazole. The mean age at onset was 55.8 ± 14.8 years with a female predominance. The average duration of treatment with aripiprazole was 18.4 ± 26.4 months. Oro-bucco-lingual stereotypy was seen in all patients. In most patients, TD did not spontaneously improve after stopping aripiprazole. Of the 5 patients treated with tetrabenazine, 4 improved during follow-up. Although aripiprazole, a third generation antipsychotic, has been promoted to have a low risk of TD, the drug accounts for about 3.5% of patients with TD evaluated in a movement disorders clinic. This largest reported series draws attention to the growing incidence of TD and other drug-induced movement disorders associated with "atypical antipsychotics."

Antipsychotics may cause tardive dyskinesia in humans and orofacial dyskinesia in rodents. Although the dopaminergic system has been implicated in these movement disorders, which involve the basal ganglia, their underlying pathomechanisms remain unclear. CB1 cannabinoid receptors are highly expressed in the basal ganglia, and a potential role for endocannabinoids in the control of basal ganglia-related movement disorders has been proposed. Therefore, this study investigated whether CB1 receptors are involved in haloperidol-induced orofacial dyskinesia in rats. Adult male rats were treated for four weeks with haloperidol decanoate (38mg/kg, intramuscularly - i.m.). The effect of anandamide (6nmol, intracerebroventricularly - i.c.v.) and/or the CB1 receptor antagonist SR141716A (30μg, i.c.v.) on haloperidol-induced vacuous chewing movements (VCMs) was assessed 28days after the start of the haloperidol treatment. Anandamide reversed haloperidol-induced VCMs; SR141716A (30μg, i.c.v.) did not alter haloperidol-induced VCM per se but prevented the effect of anandamide on VCM in rats. These results suggest that CB1 receptors may prevent haloperidol-induced VCMs in rats, implicating CB1 receptor-mediated cannabinoid signaling in orofacial dyskinesia.

Tardive dyskinesia (TD) is a movement disorder characterized by abnormal involuntary facial movements induced by chronic therapy with classical antipsychotic medications. Currently, there is no satisfactory pharmacotherapy for TD, which represents a major limitation to therapy with classical antipsychotics. In order to develop or optimize therapies for TD, and to develop new APDs with lower indices of motor side effects, the pathology underlying TD must first be understood. The use of animal models has been used to further this objective. Here, we review different preparations that have been used to model TD and discuss the contribution of neuroimaging studies conducted in these models. Studies in animal models have lead to several hypotheses of TD pathology, although none has yet emerged as the ultimate underlying cause of this syndrome. We discuss alterations in functional indices, neuron and synapse morphology and changes in specific neurotransmitter systems that have been described in animal models of TD, and outline how these findings have contributed to our understanding of antipsychotic-induced dyskinesias. We conclude that several non-mutually exclusive theories of TD are supported by animal studies, including increases in oxidative stress leading to structural and functional changes in specific neurotransmitter systems. Elucidating the mechanisms underlying TD neuropathology partly through the use of animal models will lead to the development of APDs with superior side effect profiles or more effective therapies for TD.

Tardive dyskinesia (TD) is a serious, often disabling, movement disorder that is caused by medications that block dopamine receptors (i.e., neuroleptics, anti-emetics). There is currently no standard treatment approach for physicians confronted with such patients. This may be the result of notions that TD is disappearing because of the switch to second-generation antipsychotic agents and that it is largely reversible. In this article we demonstrate that second-generation antipsychotics do, indeed, cause TD and, in fact, the frequency is likely higher than expected because of growing off-label uses and a tripling of prescriptions written in the last 10 years. In addition, studies demonstrate that TD actually remits in only a minority of patients when these drugs are withdrawn. Furthermore, neuroleptic agents are often utilized to treat TD, despite prolonged exposure being a risk factor for irreversibility. The outcome of these trends is a growing population afflicted with TD. We review non-neuroleptic agents that have shown positive results in small, early-phase, blinded trials, including tetrabenazine, amantadine, levetiracetam, piracetam, clonazepam, propranolol, vitamin B6, and Ginkgo biloba. Other options, such as botulinum toxin and deep brain stimulation, will also be discussed, and a suggested treatment algorithm is provided. While these agents are reasonable treatment options at this time there is a need, with a concerted effort between neurology and psychiatry, for full-scale drug development, including multicenter, randomized, blinded trials to confirm the effectiveness of the agents that were positive in phase 2 trials and the development of newer ones.
