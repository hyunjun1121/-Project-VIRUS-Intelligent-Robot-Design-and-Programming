Where is the organ of Corti located?

The cochlea, a coiled structure located in the ventral region of the inner ear, acts as the primary structure for the perception of sound. Along the length of the cochlear spiral is the organ of Corti, a highly derived and rigorously patterned sensory epithelium that acts to convert auditory stimuli into neural impulses. The development of the organ of Corti requires a series of inductive events that specify unique cellular characteristics and axial identities along its three major axes. Here, we review recent studies of the cellular and molecular processes regulating several aspects of cochlear development, such as axial patterning, cochlear outgrowth and cellular differentiation. We highlight how the precise coordination of multiple signaling pathways is required for the successful formation of a complete organ of Corti.

Several factors trigger apoptosis in cochlear hair cells. Previous studies have shown that mitochondria play key roles in apoptosis, but the role of mitochondrial deoxyribonucleic acid (mtDNA) copy number in the pathogenesis of hair cell apoptosis remains largely unknown. We used mouse cochlear hair cells and House Ear Institute‑Organ of Corti 1 (HEI‑OC1) cells to explore the relationship between mtDNA copy number and cell apoptosis. We found that the mtDNA copy number of hair cells was reduced relative to mitochondrial mass and hypothesized that increasing it might have a protective effect. We then increased the mtDNA copy number of the hair and HEI‑OC1 cells by transfecting them with an adeno‑associated virus (AAV) vector containing mitochondrial transcription factor A (TFAM). We found that the apoptosis rates decreased upon inducing apoptosis with neomycin or cisplatin (DDP). To elucidate the mechanisms, we analyzed the mitochondrial‑membrane permeability and mitochondrial function of HEI‑OC1 cells. Our results suggested that the increase in mtDNA copy number could protect hair cells and HEI‑OC1 cells against drug‑induced apoptosis by stabilizing the permeability of the mitochondrial membrane and mitochondrial function.

"Growing old" is the most common cause of hearing loss. Age-related hearing loss (ARHL) (presbycusis) first affects the ability to understand speech in background noise, even when auditory thresholds in quiet are normal. It has been suggested that cochlear denervation ("synaptopathy") is an early contributor to age-related auditory decline. In the present work, we characterized age-related cochlear synaptic degeneration and hair cell loss in mice with enhanced α9α10 cholinergic nicotinic receptors gating kinetics ("gain of function" nAChRs). These mediate inhibitory olivocochlear feedback through the activation of associated calcium-gated potassium channels. Cochlear function was assessed via distortion product otoacoustic emissions and auditory brainstem responses. Cochlear structure was characterized in immunolabeled organ of Corti whole mounts using confocal microscopy to quantify hair cells, auditory neurons, presynaptic ribbons, and postsynaptic glutamate receptors. Aged wild-type mice had elevated acoustic thresholds and synaptic loss. Afferent synapses were lost from inner hair cells throughout the aged cochlea, together with some loss of outer hair cells. In contrast, cochlear structure and function were preserved in aged mice with gain-of-function nAChRs that provide enhanced olivocochlear inhibition, suggesting that efferent feedback is important for long-term maintenance of inner ear function. Our work provides evidence that olivocochlear-mediated resistance to presbycusis-ARHL occurs via the α9α10 nAChR complexes on outer hair cells. Thus, enhancement of the medial olivocochlear system could be a viable strategy to prevent age-related hearing loss.

We study the vibration modes of a short section in the middle turn of the gerbil cochlea including both longitudinal and radial interstitial fluid spaces between the pillar cells (PC) and the sensory hair cells to determine the role of the interstitial fluid flow within the organ of corti (OoC). Three detailed finite element (FE) models of the cochlear short section (CSS) are studied. In model 1, the CSS is without fluids; model 2 includes the OoC fluid, but not the exterior scalae fluids; and model 3 is the CSS with both scalae and OoC fluids. We find that: (1) the fundamental mode shape of models 1 or 3 is similar to the classical basilar membrane (BM) bending mode that includes pivoting of the arch of corti, and hence determines the low frequency vibrational mode shape of the cochlea in the presence of the cochlear wave. (2) The fundamental mode shape of model 2 is characterized by a cross-sectional shape change similar to the passive response of the cochlea. This mode shape includes a tilting motion of the inner hair cell (IHC) region, a fluid motion within the tunnel of corti (ToC) in the radial direction and along the OoC, and a bulging motion of the reticular lamina (RL) above the outer hair cell (OHC). Each of these motions provides a plausible mode of excitation of the sensory hair cells. (3) The higher vibrational modes of model 1 are similar to the electrically evoked response within the OoC and suggests that the higher vibrational modes are responsible for the active response of the cochlea. We also observed that the fluid flow through the OoC interstitial space is significant, and the model comparison suggests that the OoC fluid contributes to the biphasic BM motion seen in electrical stimulation experiments. The effect of fluid viscosity on cilium deflection was assessed by performing a transient analysis to calculate the cilium shearing gain. The gain values are found to be within the range of experimentally measured values reported by Dallos et al. (1996, The Cochlea, Springer-Verlag, New York).

High sensitivity and selectivity of hearing require an active cochlea. The cochlear sensory epithelium, the organ of Corti, vibrates because of external and internal excitations. The external stimulation is acoustic pressures mediated by the scala fluids, whereas the internal excitation is generated by a type of sensory receptor cells (the outer hair cells) in response to the acoustic vibrations. The outer hair cells are cellular actuators that are responsible for cochlear amplification. The organ of Corti is highly structured for transmitting vibrations originating from acoustic pressure and active outer hair cell force to the inner hair cells that synapse on afferent nerves. Understanding how the organ of Corti vibrates because of acoustic pressure and outer hair cell force is critical for explaining cochlear function. In this study, cochleae were freshly isolated from young gerbils. The organ of Corti in the excised cochlea was subjected to mechanical and electrical stimulation that are analogous to acoustic and cellular stimulation in the natural cochlea. Organ of Corti vibrations, including those of individual outer hair cells, were measured using optical coherence tomography. Respective vibration patterns due to mechanical and electrical stimulation were characterized. Interactions between the two vibration patterns were investigated by applying the two forms of stimulation simultaneously. Our results show that the interactions could be either constructive or destructive, which implies that the outer hair cells can either amplify or reduce vibrations in the organ of Corti. We discuss a potential consequence of the two interaction modes for cochlear frequency tuning.
