To evaluate a series of patients with corneal ectasia after LASIK that underwent the Athens Protocol: combined topography-guided photorefractive keratectomy (PRK) to reduce or eliminate induced myopia and astigmatism followed by sequential, same-day ultraviolet A (UVA) corneal collagen cross-linking (CXL). Thirty-two consecutive corneal ectasia cases underwent transepithelial PRK (WaveLight ALLEGRETTO) immediately followed by CXL (3 mW/cm(2)) for 30 minutes using 0.1% topical riboflavin sodium phosphate. Uncorrected distance visual acuity (UDVA), corrected distance visual acuity (CDVA), manifest refraction spherical equivalent, keratometry, central ultrasonic pachymetry, corneal tomography (Oculus Pentacam), and endothelial cell counts were analyzed. Mean follow-up was 27 months (range: 6 to 59 months). Twenty-seven of 32 eyes had an improvement in UDVA and CDVA of 20/45 or better (2.25 logMAR) at last follow-up. Four eyes showed some topographic improvement but no improvement in CDVA. One of the treated eyes required a subsequent penetrating keratoplasty. Corneal haze grade 2 was present in 2 eyes. Combined, same-day, topography-guided PRK and CXL appeared to offer tomographic stability, even after long-term follow-up. Only 2 of 32 eyes had corneal ectasia progression after the intervention. Seventeen of 32 eyes appeared to have improvement in UDVA and CDVA with follow-up >1.5 years. This technique may offer an alternative in the management of iatrogenic corneal ectasia.

To investigate refractive, topometric, pachymetric, and visual rehabilitation changes induced by anterior surface normalization for keratoconus by partial topography-guided excimer laser ablation in conjunction with accelerated, high-fluence cross-linking. Two hundred thirty-one keratoconic cases subjected to the Athens Protocol procedure were studied for visual acuity, keratometry, pachymetry, and anterior surface irregularity indices up to 3 years postoperatively by Scheimpflug imaging (Oculus Optikgeräte GmbH, Wetzlar, Germany). Mean visual acuity changes at 3 years postoperatively were +0.38 ± 0.31 (range: -0.34 to +1.10) for uncorrected distance visual acuity and +0.20 ± 0.21 (range: -0.32 to +0.90) for corrected distance visual acuity. Mean K1 (flat meridian) keratometric values were 46.56 ± 3.83 diopters (D) (range: 39.75 to 58.30 D) preoperatively, 44.44 ± 3.97 D (range: 36.10 to 55.50 D) 1 month postoperatively, and 43.22 ± 3.80 D (range: 36.00 to 53.70 D) up to 3 years postoperatively. The average Index of Surface Variance was 98.48 ± 43.47 (range: 17 to 208) pre-operatively and 76.80 ± 38.41 (range: 7 to 190) up to 3 years postoperatively. The average Index of Height Decentration was 0.091 ± 0.053 μm (range: 0.006 to 0.275 μm) preoperatively and 0.057 ± 0.040 μm (range: 0.001 to 0.208 μm) up to 3 years postoperatively. Mean thinnest corneal thickness was 451.91 ± 40.02 μm (range: 297 to 547 μm) preoperatively, 353.95 ± 53.90 μm (range: 196 to 480 μm) 1 month postoperatively, and 370.52 ± 58.21 μm (range: 218 to 500 μm) up to 3 years postoperatively. The Athens Protocol to arrest keratectasia progression and improve corneal regularity demonstrates safe and effective results as a keratoconus management option. Progressive potential for long-term flattening validates using caution in the surface normalization to avoid overcorrection.

To compare epithelial remodeling in keratoconic eyes that had photorefractive keratectomy and corneal collagen crosslinking (Athens protocol) with that in untreated keratoconic eyes and healthy eyes. Private clinical practice, Athens, Greece. Comparative case series. Fourier-domain anterior segment optical coherence tomography (AS-OCT) was used to obtain in vivo 3-dimensional epithelial thickness maps and center, superior, inferior, maximum, minimum, mean, midperipheral, and variability data. Group A comprised 175 treated keratoconic eyes (Athens protocol); Group B, 193 untreated keratoconic eyes; and Group C, 160 healthy eyes. The 1-year mean center epithelial thickness in Group A was 47.78 μm ± 7.36 (SD) (range 33 to 64 μm). At the first clinical visit, it was 52.09 ± 6.80 μm (range 36 to 72 μm) in Group B and 52.54 ± 3.23 μm (range 45 to 59 μm) in Group C. The mean thickness range in Group A at 1 year was -19.94 ± 7.21 μm (range -6 to -34 μm). It was -21.83 ± 12.07 μm (range -4 to -66 μm) in Group B and -6.86 ± 3.33 μm (range -3 to -29 μm) in Group C. The mean topographic thickness variability in Group A at 1 year was 4.64 ± 1.63 μm (range 1.6 to 8.1 μm) (P<.05). It was 5.77 ± 3.39 μm (range 1.3 to 17.8 μm) in Group B and 1.59 ± 0.79 μm (range 0.6 to 5.6 μm) in Group C. Anterior segment OCT indicated a thinner and more homogeneous remodeled epithelium in the keratoconic eyes treated using the Athens protocol.

To evaluate the safety and efficacy of combined transepithelial topography-guided photorefractive keratectomy (PRK) therapeutic remodeling, combined with same-day, collagen cross-linking (CXL). This protocol was used for the management of cornea blindness due to severe corneal scarring. A 57-year-old man had severe corneal blindness in both eyes. Both corneas had significant central scars attributed to a firework explosion 45 years ago, when the patient was 12 years old. Corrected distance visual acuity (CDVA) was 20/100 both eyes (OU) with refraction: +4.00, -4.50 at 135° in the right eye and +3.50, -1.00 at 55° in the left. Respective keratometries were: 42.3, 60.4 at 17° and 35.8, 39.1 at 151.3°. Cornea transplantation was the recommendation by multiple cornea specialists as the treatment of choice. We decided prior to considering a transplant to employ the Athens Protocol (combined topography-guided partial PRK and CXL) in the right eye in February 2010 and in the left eye in September 2010. The treatment plan for both eyes was designed on the topography-guided wavelight excimer laser platform. Fifteen months after the right eye treatment, the right cornea had improved translucency and was topographically stable with uncorrected distance visual acuity (UDVA) 20/50 and CDVA 20/40 with refraction +0.50, -2.00 at 5°. We noted a similar outcome after similar treatment applied in the left eye with UDVA 20/50 and CDVA 20/40 with -0.50, -2.00 at 170° at the 8-month follow-up. In this case, the introduction of successful management of severe cornea abnormalities and scarring with the Athens Protocol may provide an effective alternative to other existing surgical or medical options.

To investigate preoperative and postoperative anterior and posterior keratometry and simulated corneal astigmatism in keratoconic eyes treated with collagen cross-linking combined with anterior surface normalization by partial topography-guided excimer ablation (the Athens Protocol). Anterior and posterior corneal keratometry were measured by Scheimpflug imaging for 267 untreated keratoconic eyes. Following treatment, they were assessed 1 year postoperatively. Before treatment, average anterior keratometric value was 47.06 ± 6.02 diopters (D) for flat and 51.24 ± 6.75 D for steep. The posterior keratometric values were -6.70 ± 0.99 D (flat) and -7.67 ± 1.15 D (steep). Anterior astigmatism was on average with-the-rule (-1.97 ± 6.21 D), whereas posterior astigmatism was against-the-rule (+0.53 ± 1.02 D). The posterior and anterior astigmatism were highly correlated (r(2) = 0.839). After treatment, anterior keratometric values were 43.97 ± 5.81 D (flat) and 46.55 ± 6.82 D (steep). Posterior keratometric values were -6.58 ± 1.05 D (flat) and -7.69 ± 1.22 D (steep). Anterior astigmatism was on average with-the-rule (-1.56 ± 3.80 D), whereas posterior astigmatism was against-the-rule (+0.45 ± 1.29 D). The statistically significant (P < .05) keratometric changes indicated anterior surface flattening -3.09 ± 2.67 D (flat) and -4.19 ± 2.96 D (steep). The posterior keratometric changes were not statistically significant (P > .05). Before treatment, there was a strong correlation between posterior and anterior corneal astigmatism. After treatment, statistically significant anterior keratometric values flattened. The posterior surface keratometric values did not demonstrate statistically significant postoperative change: there was minimal posterior change, despite the significant anterior surface normalization.
