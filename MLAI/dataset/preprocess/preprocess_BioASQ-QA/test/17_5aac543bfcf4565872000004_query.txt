Allergic rhinitis is characterized by the epithelial accumulation of cells, particularly mast cells and eosinophils. There is little information relating to the chemotaxins responsible for mast cell epithelial accumulation in this disease. Expression of the mast cell chemoattractants TGF-beta, eotaxin, and stem cell factor and their receptors was investigated in tissue sections from biopsy specimens obtained from patients with naturally occurring allergic rhinitis. Specific immunohistochemical staining was performed on thin sections of inferior turbinate biopsy specimens from patients with perennial and seasonal allergic rhinitis and, for comparison, from nonatopic and, where relevant, atopic healthy volunteers without rhinitis. Sequential staining of adjacent 2-microm sections was undertaken to colocalize TGF-beta receptors to mast cells. Evidence was found of significantly increased epithelial immunoreactivity for TGF-beta1, TGF-beta2, TGF-beta3, TGF-beta receptor I, TGF-beta receptor II, and TGF-beta receptor III in patients with perennial and seasonal allergic rhinitis compared with that seen in healthy control subjects. TGF-beta receptors I and II were found to colocalize to mast cells. Eotaxin epithelial immunoreactivity was significantly increased in the perennial group, although there were no corresponding disease-related differences found in relation to CCR-3 immunoreactivity at this site. There was no increase in stem cell factor immunoreactivity within the epithelium in naturally occurring disease. Significant correlations were found between epithelial immunoreactivity for TGF-beta1, TGF-beta2, TGF-beta receptor I, TGF-beta receptor II, and the number of epithelial mast cells. These findings of enhanced epithelial TGF-beta immunoreactivity in patients with rhinitis, the correlation with intraepithelial mast cell numbers, and the colocalization of TGF-beta receptors to mast cells suggest that the epithelial expression of TGF-beta might represent an important biologic process involved in either the recruitment or retention of mast cells within the epithelium in naturally occurring allergic rhinitis.

Celiac disease (CD) is an immune-mediated disorder characterized by an accumulation of immune cells in the duodenal mucosa as a consequence of both adaptive and innate immune responses to undigested gliadin peptides. Mast cells (MCs) are innate immune cells that are a major source of costimulatory signals and inflammatory mediators in the intestinal mucosa. Although MCs have previously been associated with CD, functional studies have never been performed. We aimed at evaluating the role of MCs in the pathogenesis of CD. Intestinal biopsy specimens of patients with CD were scored according to the Marsh classification and characterized for leukocyte infiltration and MC distribution. Moreover, MC reactivity to gliadin and its peptides was characterized by using inÂ vitro assays. Infiltrating MCs were associated with the severity of mucosal damage, and their numbers were increased in patients with higher Marsh scores. MCs were found to directly respond to nonimmunodominant gliadin fragments by releasing proinflammatory mediators. Immunohistochemical characterization of infiltrating MCs and the effects of gliadin peptides on intestinal MCs indicated an increase in proinflammatory MC function in advanced stages of the disease. This was also associated with increased neutrophil accumulation, the prevalence of M1 macrophages, and the severity of tissue damage. We provide a description of the progressive stages of CD, in which MCs are the hallmark of the inflammatory process. Thus the view of CD should be revised, and the contribution of MCs in the onset and progression of CD should be reconsidered in developing new therapeutic approaches.

Mast cells are involved in many disorders where the triggering mechanism that leads to degranulation and/or cytokine secretion has not been defined. Several chronic inflammatory diseases are associated with increased mast cell numbers and upregulation of the TNF receptor family member CD30, but the role of elevated CD30 expression is poorly understood. Here we report what we believe to be a novel way to activate mast cells with CD30 that leads to degranulation-independent secretion of chemokines. CD30 induced a de novo synthesis and secretion of the chemokines IL-8, macrophage inflammatory protein-1alpha (MIP-1alpha), and MIP-1beta, a process involving the MAPK/ERK pathway. Mast cells were found to be the predominant CD30 ligand-positive (CD30L-positive) cell in the chronic inflammatory skin diseases psoriasis and atopic dermatitis, and both CD30 and CD30L expression were upregulated in lesional skin in these conditions. Furthermore, the number of IL-8-positive mast cells was elevated both in psoriatic and atopic dermatitis lesional skin as well as in ex vivo CD30-treated healthy skin organ cultures. In summary, characterization of CD30 activation of mast cells has uncovered an IgE-independent pathway that is of importance in understanding the entirety of the role of mast cells in diseases associated with mast cells and CD30 expression. These diseases include Hodgkin lymphoma, atopic dermatitis, and psoriasis.

Mast cells (MCs) may play an important role in plaque destabilization and atherosclerotic coronary complications. Here, we have studied the presence of MCs in the intima and media of unstable and stable coronary lesions at different time points after myocardial infarction (MI). Coronary arteries were obtained at autopsy from patients with acute MI (up to 5 days old; n=27) and with chronic MI (5-14 days old; n=18), as well as sections from controls without cardiac disease (n=10). Herein, tryptase-positive MCs were quantified in the intima and media of both unstable and stable atherosclerotic plaques in infarct-related and non-infarct-related coronary arteries. In the media of both acute and chronic MI patients, the number of MCs was significantly higher than in controls. This was also found when evaluating unstable and stable plaques separately. In patients with chronic MI, the number of MCs in unstable lesions was significantly higher than in stable lesions. This coincided with a significant increase in the relative number of unstable plaques in patients with chronic MI compared with control and acute MI. No differences in MC density were found between infarct-related and non-infarct-related coronary arteries in patients with MI. The presence of MCs in the media of both stable and unstable atherosclerotic coronary lesions after MI suggests that MCs may be involved in the onset of MI and, on the other hand, that MI triggers intra-plaque infiltration of MCs especially in unstable plaques, possibly increasing the risk of re-infarction.

Mast cells are long-lived resident cells that are of great importance in an allergic reaction. It has previously been suggested that after IgE-mediated degranulation mast cells can undergo regranulation. Such a process is probably of great importance with respect to the severity and perpetuation of the allergic response. Our purpose was to investigate whether mast cells recover from degranulation and whether they still have the potential to release a granule-associated mediator and upregulate certain cytokine genes. Mouse mast cells were repeatedly activated by IgE and specific antigen with a 24-hour or 48-hour interval. During each of the 2 activation stages, release of beta-hexosaminidase was measured by means of enzymatic colorimetric analysis, and IL-13 and IL-6 mRNA was detected by ribonuclease protection assay. Both scanning electron microscopy and time-lapse photography were used to reveal the process of mast cell recovery. We found that re-activation of degranulated mast cells in response to high-affinity IgE-receptor cross-linkage triggers beta-hexosaminidase release and upregulation of IL-13 and IL-6 gene expression levels similar to what is seen in the initial activation. Scanning electron microscopy documented cells at various stages during the recovery process 30 minutes after the activation. With time-lapse photography, a single cell that had undergone degranulation could be visualized consecutively during its recovery process. Mast cells can recover after an IgE-mediated activation and can repeatedly release beta-hexosaminidase and express IL-6 and IL-13 mRNA after re-activation.

Mast cells and basophils are innate immune cells with overlapping functions that contribute to anti-helminth immunity. Mast cell function during helminth infection was previously studied using mast cell-deficient Kit-mutant mice that display additional mast cell-unrelated immune deficiencies. Here, we use mice that lack basophils or mucosal and connective tissue mast cells in a Kit-independent manner to re-evaluate the impact of each cell type during helminth infection. Neither mast cells nor basophils participated in the immune response to tissue-migrating Strongyloides ratti third-stage larvae, but both cell types contributed to the early expulsion of parasitic adults from the intestine. The termination of S. ratti infection required the presence of mucosal mast cells: Cpa3<sup>Cre</sup> mice, which lack mucosal and connective tissue mast cells, remained infected for more than 150 days. Mcpt5<sup>Cre</sup> R-DTA mice, which lack connective tissue mast cells only, and basophil-deficient Mcpt8<sup>Cre</sup> mice terminated the infection after 1 month with wild-type kinetics despite their initial increase in intestinal parasite burden. Because Cpa3<sup>Cre</sup> mice showed intact Th2 polarization and efficiently developed protective immunity after vaccination, we hypothesize that mucosal mast cells are non-redundant terminal effector cells in the intestinal epithelium that execute anti-helminth immunity but do not orchestrate it.

Mast cells are found resident in tissues throughout the body, particularly in association with structures such as blood vessels and nerves, and in proximity to surfaces that interface the external environment. Mast cells are bone marrow-derived and particularly depend upon stem cell factor for their survival. Mast cells express a variety of phenotypic features within tissues as determined by the local environment. Withdrawal of required growth factors results in mast cell apoptosis. Mast cells appear to be highly engineered cells with multiple critical biological functions. They may be activated by a number of stimuli that are both Fc epsilon RI dependent and Fc epsilon RI independent. Activation through various receptors leads to distinct signaling pathways. After activation, mast cells may immediately extrude granule-associated mediators and generate lipid-derived substances that induce immediate allergic inflammation. Mast cell activation may also be followed by the synthesis of chemokines and cytokines. Cytokine and chemokine secretion, which occurs hours later, may contribute to chronic inflammation. Biological functions of mast cells appear to include a role in innate immunity, involvement in host defense mechanisms against parasitic infestations, immunomodulation of the immune system, and tissue repair and angiogenesis.

Mast cells are significantly involved in IgE-mediated allergic reactions; however, their roles in health and disease are incompletely understood. We aimed to define the proteome contained in mast cell releasates on activation to better understand the factors secreted by mast cells that are relevant to the contribution of mast cells in diseases. Bone marrow-derived cultured mast cells (BMCMCs) and peritoneal cell-derived mast cells were used as "surrogates" for mucosal and connective tissue mast cells, respectively, and their releasate proteomes were analyzed by mass spectrometry. Our studies showed that BMCMCs and peritoneal cell-derived mast cells produced substantially different releasates following IgE-mediated activation. Moreover, we observed that the transglutaminase coagulation factor XIIIA (FXIIIA) was one of the most abundant proteins contained in the BMCMC releasates. Mast cell-deficient mice exhibited increased FXIIIA plasma and activity levels as well as reduced bleeding times, indicating that mast cells are more efficient in their ability to downregulate FXIIIA than in contributing to its amounts and functions in homeostatic conditions. We found that human chymase and mouse mast cell protease-4 (the mouse homologue of human chymase) had the ability to reduce FXIIIA levels and function via proteolytic degradation. Moreover, we found that chymase deficiency led to increased FXIIIA amounts and activity, as well as reduced bleeding times in homeostatic conditions and during sepsis. Our study indicates that the mast cell protease content can shape its releasate proteome. Moreover, we found that chymase plays an important role in the regulation of FXIIIA via proteolytic degradation.

Mast cells are ubiquitous in the body and multifunctional immune cells; they are known to be primary responders in allergic reactions, orchestrating strong responses to minute amounts of allergens. Mature mast cells perform important beneficial roles in host defense, both in IgE-dependent immune responses to certain parasites and in natural immunity to bacterial infection. In IgE-associated biological responses, the crosslinking of Fc&#949;RI-bound IgE with multivalent antigens initiate the activation of mast cells by promoting aggregation of FceRI. This cross-linking receptor-bound IgE by multivalent Ag initiates a cascade of intracellular reactions leading to mediator release such as proinflammatory mediators, chemokines and cytokines. Luteolin belongs to a flavone group of compounds called flavonoids, it has anti-oxidant properties, inhibits some cancer cell proliferation and exerts a regulatory effect on mast cell-mediated inflammatory diseases and allergy. Here we report the impact of luteolin on mast cell activation.

Mast cells act as sensors in innate immunity and as effector cells in adaptive immune reactions. Here we demonstrate that SLC10A4, also referred to as the vesicular aminergic-associated transporter, VAAT, modifies mast cell degranulation. Strikingly, Slc10a4 <sup>-/-</sup> bone marrow-derived mast cells (BMMCs) had a significant reduction in the release of granule-associated mediators in response to IgE/antigen-mediated activation, whereas the in vitro development of mast cells, the storage of the granule-associated enzyme mouse mast cell protease 6 (mMCP-6), and the release of prostaglandin D2 and IL-6 were normal. Slc10a4-deficient mice had a strongly reduced passive cutaneous anaphylaxis reaction and a less intense itching behaviour in response to the mast cell degranulator 48/80. Live imaging of the IgE/antigen-mediated activation showed decreased degranulation and that ATP was retained to a higher degree in mast cell granules lacking SLC10A4. Furthermore, ATP was reduced by two thirds in Slc10a4 <sup>-/-</sup> BMMCs supernatants in response to IgE/antigen. We speculate that SLC10A4 affects the amount of granule-associated ATP upon IgE/antigen-induced mast cell activation, which affect the release of granule-associated mast cell mediators. In summary, SLC10A4 acts as a regulator of degranulation in vitro and of mast cell-related reactions in vivo.

Mast cells are important elements of the body response to foreign antigens, being those represented either by small molecules (allergic response) or harbored by foreign microorganisms (response to parasite infection). These cells derive from hematopoietic stem/progenitor cells present in the marrow. However, in contrast with most of the other hematopoietic lineages, mast cells do not differentiate in the marrow but in highly vascularized extramedullary sites, such as the skin or the gut. Mast cell differentiation in the marrow is activated as part of the body response to parasites. We will review here the mast cell differentiation pathway and what is known of its major intrinsic and extrinsic control mechanisms. It will also be described that thrombopoietin, the ligand for the Mpl receptor, in addition to its pivotal rule in the control of thrombocytopoiesis and of hematopoietic stem/progenitor cell proliferation, exerts a regulatory function in mast cell differentiation. Some of the possible implications of this newly described biological activity of thrombopoietin will be discussed.

Mast cells have long been known to play a detrimental role in the pathogenesis of IgE-associated allergic disorders by their ability to release a wide variety of pro-inflammatory mediators. A number of studies, however, have demonstrated that mast cells play a beneficial role in innate host defense against bacterial infections. Since mast cells clearly play both physiological and pathophysiological functions in the body, it is important to learn about the components of mast cells that drive these responses. The functional roles of mast cell in vivo have been principally characterized by comparing the biological responses in mast cell-deficient mice (WBB6F(1)-W/W(v)), their normal wild-type littermates (WBB6F(1)-+/+) and mast cell deficient mice reconstituted locally or systemically with mast cells cultured from the bone marrow cells of WBB6F(1)-+/+ mice (WBB6F(1)-W/W(v)+MC). Recently investigators have demonstrated that mast cell-deficient mice (WBB6F(1)-W/W(v)) can be reconstituted with mast cells derived in vitro from the bone marrow cells of certain gene knock-out mice or genetically-manipulated embryonic stem cells. This novel approach of analyzing the biological consequences of gene mutations in mast cells will help us to better understand the role of individual gene products in mast cell responses. In this review, we discuss these new approaches to investigate the functions of mast cells in vivo.

The mast cell is the cellular basis for immediate hypersensitivity reactions. The specificity of the immediate hypersensitivity reaction is attributable to IgE molecules fixed to specific membrane receptors which, when stimulated by specific antigen, initiates the process of degranulation of the mast cell. The granules provide three separate sources of biologic activity: performed or primary mediators, newly generated or secondary mediators, and activities associated with the granular matrix. A number of biologic consequences are generated in response to these mediators and these include: increased vascular permeability, vasodilation, smooth muscle spasm, polymorphonuclear leukocyte chemotaxis, stimulation of adenylate and guanylate cyclase, superoxide radical generation, prostaglandin formation, mucous and gastric acid secretion, hypotension, tissue destruction, and mononuclear leukocyte infiltration. This pharmacopia of activities accounts for the clinical aspects of allergic diseases, suggests that the mast cell granule may be involved in the host's defense against parasitic infections, and is compatible with a suggested role of the mast cell as a widely distributed, monocellular endocrine system.

Mast cell activation has been shown to be an initiator and a key determinant of foreign body reactions. However, there is no non-invasive method that can quantify the degree of implant-associated mast cell activation. Taking advantage of the fact that fibrin deposition is a hallmark of mast cell activation around biomaterial implants, a near infrared probe was fabricated to have high affinity to fibrin. Subsequent in vitro testing confirmed that this probe has high affinity to fibrin. Using a subcutaneous particle implantation model, we found significant accumulation of fibrin-affinity probes at the implant sites as early as 15 min following particle implantation. The accumulation of fibrin-affinity probes at the implantation sites could also be substantially reduced if anti-coagulant - heparin was administered at the implant sites. Further studies have shown that subcutaneous administration of mast cell activator - compound 48/80 - prompted the accumulation of fibrin-affinity probes. However, implant-associated fibrin-affinity probe accumulation was substantially reduced in mice with mast cell deficiency. The results show that our fibrin-affinity probes may serve as a powerful tool to monitor and measure the extent of biomaterial-mediated fibrin deposition and mast cell activation in vivo.

Mast cells are widely distributed throughout the body, predominantly near blood vessels and nerves, and express effector functions in allergic reactions, inflammatory diseases, and host defense. The activation of mast cells results in secretion of the preformed chemical mediators in their granules by a regulated process of exocytosis and leads to synthesis and secretion of lipid mediators and cytokines. Their soluble factors contribute to allergic inflammation. Mast cells are associated with hypersensitivity reactions, not only in the classical immunoglobulin E (IgE)-dependent mechanism but also in an IgE-independent manner. In particular, investigations of potential anatomical and functional interactions between mast cells and the nervous system have recently attracted great interest. To understand these molecular mechanisms in mast cell activation, the ability to visualize, track, and quantify molecules and events in living mast cells is an essential and powerful tool. Recent dramatic advances in imaging technology and labeling techniques have enabled us to carry out these tasks with high spatiotemporal resolution using confocal laser scanning microscopes, green fluorescent protein and its derivatives, and image analysis systems. Here we review our investigations of the dynamic processes of intracellular signaling molecules, cellular structure, and interactions with neurons in mast cells to provide basic and valuable information for allergy and clinical immunology using these new imaging methods.

Mast cells are important effector cells of the immune system and recent studies show that they have immunomodulatory roles in diverse processes in both health and disease. Mast cells are distinguished by their high content of electron-dense secretory granules, which are filled with large amounts of preformed and pre-activated immunomodulatory compounds. When appropriately activated, mast cells undergo degranulation, a process by which these preformed granule compounds are rapidly released into the surroundings. In many cases, the effects that mast cells have on an immune response are closely associated with the biological actions of the granule compounds that they release, as exemplified by the recent studies showing that mast cell granule proteases account for many of the protective and detrimental effects of mast cells in various inflammatory settings. In this Review, we discuss the current knowledge of mast cell secretory granules.

Mast cells are one of the major effector cells in the pathogenesis of the immediate-type hypersensitivity reaction in a number of non-allergic immune disorders as well as in normal physiological processes. In addition, it has been shown recently that mast cells also play a significant role in a life-saving host response to bacterial reactions. But as much as the immunopathological role of mast cells has been acknowledged, these cells have also aroused much controversy and confusion. By now it is clear that one explanation for the sometimes even contradictory opinions on mast cell function arise from mast cell heterogeneity. This heterogeneity can express itself as differences in histochemical, biochemical, and functional characteristics. In vitro systems provided a powerful tool for the investigation of the basic mechanisms for mast cell development and differentiation and helped to demonstrate that mast cell heterogeneity can be traced back to certain cytokine patterns that are present in different microenvironments. In this context it has also been shown that the growth factors required for human mast cell differentiation are somewhat different than those for rodents. In rodents, the atypical, T cell-dependent mucosal type mast cell can be distinguished from the T cell-independent connective tissue-type mast cell. In humans, the strict classification into mucosal and connective tissue-type mast cells is not possible and the content of mast cell-specific proteases chymase and tryptase is the main criterion for mast cell subtypes in humans. The large quantities of tryptase and chymase that are synthesized by mast cells suggest and emphasize the significance of these proteinases in mast cell function and stimulated investigations about the biological properties of these mast cell-specific proteases. Comparing their biological activities it becomes clear that they share some activities. On the other hand, tryptase seems to participate in proinflammatory mast cell function, whereas chymase seems to be more involved in inflammatory reactions. This review provides a short overview of the discovery, origin, development, and biological significance of mast cells and will then concentrate on mast cell heterogeneity in rodents and humans with respect to the mast cell proteases tryptase and chymase and their function.
