Aberrant activation of the classical complement pathway is the common underlying pathophysiology of orphan diseases such as bullous pemphigoid, antibody-mediated rejection of organ transplants, cold agglutinin disease, and warm autoimmune hemolytic anemia. Therapeutic options for these complement-mediated disorders are limited and sutimlimab, a humanized monoclonal antibody directed against complement factor C1s, may be potentially useful for inhibition of the classical complement pathway. A phase I, first-in-human, double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled, dose-escalation trial of single and multiple doses of sutimlimab or placebo was conducted in 64 volunteers to evaluate safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetic, and pharmacodynamic profiles. Single and multiple infusions of sutimlimab were well tolerated without any safety concerns. sutimlimab exhibited a steep concentration-effect relationship with a Hill coefficient of 2.4, and an IC<sub>90</sub> of 15.5 Î¼g/mL. This study establishes the foundation for using sutimlimab as a highly selective inhibitor of the classical complement pathway in different diseases.

The classical pathway of complement (CP) can mediate C3 opsonization of Ags responsible for the costimulation and activation of cognate B lymphocytes. In this manner, the complement system acts as a bridge between the innate and adaptive immune systems critical for establishing a humoral response. However, aberrant complement activation is often observed in autoimmune diseases in which C3 deposition on self-antigens may serve to activate self-reactive B cell clones. In this study, we use BIVV009 (Sutimlimab), a clinical stage, humanized mAb that specifically inhibits the CP-specific serine protease C1s to evaluate the impact of upstream CP antagonism on activation and proliferation of normal and autoimmune human B cells. We report that BIVV009 significantly inhibited complement-mediated activation and proliferation of primary human B cells. Strikingly, CP antagonism suppressed human Ig-induced activation of B cells derived from patients with rheumatoid arthritis. These results suggest that clinical use of CP inhibitors in autoimmune patients may not only block complement-mediated tissue damage, but may also prevent the long-term activation of autoimmune B cells and the production of autoantibodies that contribute to the underlying pathologic condition of these diseases.

Autoimmune hemolytic anemia (AIHA) is a highly heterogeneous disease due to increased destruction of autologous erythrocytes by autoantibodies with or without complement involvement. Other pathogenic mechanisms include hyper-activation of cellular immune effectors, cytokine dysregulation, and ineffective marrow compensation. AIHAs may be primary or associated with lymphoproliferative and autoimmune diseases, infections, immunodeficiencies, solid tumors, transplants, and drugs. The direct antiglobulin test is the cornerstone of diagnosis, allowing the distinction into warm forms (wAIHA), cold agglutinin disease (CAD), and other more rare forms. The immunologic mechanisms responsible for erythrocyte destruction in the various AIHAs are different and therefore therapy is quite dissimilar. In wAIHA, steroids represent first line therapy, followed by rituximab and splenectomy. Conventional immunosuppressive drugs (azathioprine, cyclophosphamide, cyclosporine) are now considered the third line. In CAD, steroids are useful only at high/unacceptable doses and splenectomy is uneffective. Rituximab is advised in first line therapy, followed by rituximab plus bendamustine and bortezomib. Several new drugs are under development including B-cell directed therapies (ibrutinib, venetoclax, parsaclisib) and inhibitors of complement (sutimlimab, pegcetacoplan), spleen tyrosine kinases (fostamatinib), or neonatal Fc receptor. Here, a comprehensive review of the main clinical characteristics, diagnosis, and pathogenic mechanisms of AIHA are provided, along with classic and new therapeutic approaches.

The last decades have seen great progress in the treatment of cold agglutinin disease (CAD). Comparative trials are lacking, and recommendations must be based mainly on nonrandomized trials and will be influenced by personal experience. Herein, current treatment options are reviewed and linked to 3 cases, each addressing specific aspects of therapy. Two major steps in CAD pathogenesis are identified, clonal B-cell lymphoproliferation and complement-mediated hemolysis, each of which constitutes a target of therapy. Although drug treatment is not always indicated, patients with symptomatic anemia or other bothersome symptoms should be treated. The importance of avoiding ineffective therapies is underscored. Corticosteroids should not be used to treat CAD. Studies on safety and efficacy of relevant drugs and combinations are briefly described. The author recommends that B cell-directed approaches remain the first choice in most patients requiring treatment. The 4-cycle bendamustine plus rituximab combination is highly efficacious and sufficiently safe and induces durable responses in most patients, but the time to response can be many months. Rituximab monotherapy should be preferred in frail patients. The complement C1s inhibitor sutimlimab is an emerging option in the second line and may also find its place in the first line in specific situations.

Complement is an elaborate system of innate immunity. Genetic variants and autoantibodies leading to excessive complement activation are implicated in a variety of human diseases. Among them, the hematologic disease paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria (PNH) remains the prototypic model of complement activation and inhibition. Eculizumab, the first-in-class complement inhibitor, was approved for PNH in 2007. Addressing some of the unmet needs, a long-acting C5 inhibitor, ravulizumab, and a C3 inhibitor, pegcetacoplan, have also now been approved for PNH. Novel agents, such as factor B and factor D inhibitors, are under study, with very promising results. In this era of several approved targeted complement therapeutics, selection of the proper drug must be based on a personalized approach. Beyond PNH, complement inhibition has also shown efficacy and safety in cold agglutinin disease, primarily with the C1s inhibitor of the classical complement pathway sutimlimab, as well as with pegcetacoplan. Furthermore, C5 inhibition with eculizumab and ravulizumab, as well as inhibition of the lectin pathway with narsoplimab, is being investigated in transplantation-associated thrombotic microangiopathy. With this revolution of next-generation complement therapeutics, additional hematologic entities, such as delayed hemolytic transfusion reaction or immune thrombocytopenia, might also benefit from complement inhibitors. Therefore, this review aims to describe state-of-the-art knowledge of targeting complement in hematologic diseases, focusing on (1) complement biology for the clinician, (2) complement activation and therapeutic inhibition in prototypic complement-mediated hematologic diseases, (3) hematologic entities under investigation for complement inhibition, and (4) other complement-related disorders of potential interest to hematologists.

Cold agglutinin disease (CAD) is a complement-dependent, classical pathway-mediated immune hemolytic disease, accounting for 15-25% of autoimmune hemolytic anemia, and at the same time, a distinct clonal B-cell lymphoproliferative disorder of the bone marrow. The disease burden is often high, but not all patients require pharmacological treatment. Several therapies directed at the pathogenic B-cells are now available. Rituximab plus bendamustine or rituximab monotherapy should be considered first-line treatment, depending on individual patient characteristics. Novel treatment options that target the classical complement pathway are under development and appear very promising, and the C1s inhibitor sutimlimab is currently being investigated in two clinical Phase II and III trials. These achievements have raised new challenges and further prospects, which are discussed. Patients with CAD requiring therapy should be considered for clinical trials.

Cold agglutinin disease is a difficult-to-treat autoimmune hemolytic anemia in which immunoglobulin M antibodies bind to erythrocytes and fix complement, resulting in predominantly extravascular hemolysis. This trial tested the hypothesis that the anti-C1s antibody sutimlimab would ameliorate hemolytic anemia. Ten patients with cold agglutinin disease participated in the phase 1b component of a first-in-human trial. Patients received a test dose of 10-mg/kg sutimlimab followed by a full dose of 60 mg/kg 1 to 4 days later and 3 additional weekly doses of 60 mg/kg. All infusions were well tolerated without premedication. No drug-related serious adverse events were observed. Seven of 10 patients with cold agglutinin disease responded with a hemoglobin increase >2 g/dL. Sutimlimab rapidly increased hemoglobin levels by a median of 1.6 g/dL within the first week, and by a median of 3.9 g/dL (interquartile range, 1.3-4.5 g/dL; 95% confidence interval, 2.1-4.5) within 6 weeks (<i>P</i> = .005). Sutimlimab rapidly abrogated extravascular hemolysis, normalizing bilirubin levels within 24 hours in most patients and normalizing haptoglobin levels in 4 patients within 1 week. Hemolytic anemia recurred when drug levels were cleared from the circulation 3 to 4 weeks after the last dose of sutimlimab. Reexposure to sutimlimab in a named patient program recapitulated the control of hemolytic anemia. All 6 previously transfused patients became transfusion-free during treatment. Sutimlimab was safe, well tolerated, and rapidly stopped C1s complement-mediated hemolysis in patients with cold agglutinin disease, significantly increasing hemoglobin levels and precluding the need for transfusions. This trial was registered at www.clinicaltrials.gov as #NCT02502903.

Cold agglutinin disease (CAD) causes predominantly extravascular hemolysis and anemia via complement activation. Sutimlimab is a novel humanized monoclonal antibody directed against classical pathway complement factor C1s. We aimed to evaluate the safety and efficacy of long-term maintenance treatment with sutimlimab in patients with CAD. Seven CAD patients treated with sutimlimab as part of a phase 1B study were transitioned to a named patient program. After a loading dose, patients received biweekly (once every 2 weeks) infusions of sutimlimab at various doses. When a patient's laboratory data showed signs of breakthrough hemolysis, the dose of sutimlimab was increased. Three patients started with a dose of 45 mg/kg, another 3 with 60 mg/kg, and 1 with a fixed dose of 5.5 g every other week. All CAD patients responded to re-treatment, and sutimlimab increased hemoglobin from a median initial level of 7.7 g/dL to a median peak of 12.5 g/dL (P = .016). Patients maintained near normal hemoglobin levels except for a few breakthrough events that were related to underdosing and which resolved after the appropriate dose increase. Four of the patients included were eventually treated with a biweekly 5.5 g fixed-dose regimen of sutimlimab. None of them had any breakthrough hemolysis. All patients remained transfusion free while receiving sutimlimab. There were no treatment-related serious adverse events. Overlapping treatment with erythropoietin, rituximab, or ibrutinib in individual patients was safe and did not cause untoward drug interactions. Long-term maintenance treatment with sutimlimab was safe, effectively inhibited hemolysis, and significantly increased hemoglobin levels in re-exposed, previously transfusion-dependent CAD patients.

Complement-mediated hemolytic anemias can either be caused by deficiencies in regulatory complement components or by autoimmune pathogenesis that triggers inappropriate complement activation. In paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria (PNH) hemolysis is entirely complement-driven. Hemolysis is also thought to be complement-dependent in cold agglutinin disease (CAD) and in paroxysmal cold hemoglobinuria (PCH), whereas warm antibody autoimmune hemolytic anemia (wAIHA) is a partially complement-mediated disorder, depending on the subtype of wAIHA and the extent of complement activation. The pathophysiology, clinical presentation, and current therapies for these diseases are reviewed in this article. Novel, complement-directed therapies are being rapidly developed. Therapeutic terminal complement inhibition using eculizumab has revolutionized the therapy and prognosis in PNH but has proved less efficacious in CAD. Upstream complement modulation is currently being investigated and appears to be a highly promising therapy, and two such agents have entered phase II and III trials. Of these, the anti-C1s monoclonal antibody sutimlimab has shown favorable activity in CAD, while the anti-C3 cyclic peptide pegcetacoplan appears to be promising in PNH as well as CAD, and may also have a therapeutic potential in wAIHA.

Deposition of autoantibodies (Î±-BP180 and BP230) and complement along the dermal-epidermal-junction is a hallmark of bullous pemphigoid and was shown to be important for pathogenesis. Given the adverse effects of standard treatment (glucocorticoids, immunosuppressants), there is an unmet need for safe and effective therapies. In this phase 1 trial, we evaluated the safety and activity of BIVV009 (sutimlimab, previously TNT009), a targeted C1s inhibitor, in 10 subjects with active or past bullous pemphigoid (NCT02502903). Four weekly 60 mg/kg infusions of BIVV009 proved sufficient for inhibition of the classical complement pathway in all patients, as measured by CH50. C3c deposition along the dermal-epidermal junction was partially or completely abrogated in 4 of 5 patients, where it was present at baseline. BIVV009 was found to be safe and tolerable in this elderly population, with only mild to moderate adverse events reported (e.g., headache, fatigue). One serious adverse event (i.e., fatal cardiac decompensation) occurred at the end of the post-treatment observation period in an 84-year-old patient with a history of diabetes and heart failure, but was deemed unlikely to be related to the study drug. This trial provides the first results with a complement-targeting therapy in bullous pemphigoid, to our knowledge, and supports further studies on BIVV009's efficacy and safety in this population.

Cold agglutinin disease is a rare autoimmune hemolytic anemia characterized by hemolysis that is caused by activation of the classic complement pathway. Sutimlimab, a humanized monoclonal antibody, selectively targets the C1s protein, a C1 complex serine protease responsible for activating this pathway. We conducted a 26-week multicenter, open-label, single-group study to assess the efficacy and safety of intravenous sutimlimab in patients with cold agglutinin disease and a recent history of transfusion. The composite primary end point was a normalization of the hemoglobin level to 12 g or more per deciliter or an increase in the hemoglobin level of 2 g or more per deciliter from baseline, without red-cell transfusion or medications prohibited by the protocol. A total of 24 patients were enrolled and received at least one dose of sutimlimab; 13 patients (54%) met the criteria for the composite primary end point. The least-squares mean increase in hemoglobin level was 2.6 g per deciliter at the time of treatment assessment (weeks 23, 25, and 26). A mean hemoglobin level of more than 11 g per deciliter was maintained in patients from week 3 through the end of the study period. The mean bilirubin levels normalized by week 3. A total of 17 patients (71%) did not receive a transfusion from week 5 through week 26. Clinically meaningful reductions in fatigue were observed by week 1 and were maintained throughout the study. Activity in the classic complement pathway was rapidly inhibited, as assessed by a functional assay. Increased hemoglobin levels, reduced bilirubin levels, and reduced fatigue coincided with inhibition of the classic complement pathway. At least one adverse event occurred during the treatment period in 22 patients (92%). Seven patients (29%) had at least one serious adverse event, none of which were determined by the investigators to be related to sutimlimab. No meningococcal infections occurred. In patients with cold agglutinin disease who received sutimlimab, selective upstream inhibition of activity in the classic complement pathway rapidly halted hemolysis, increased hemoglobin levels, and reduced fatigue.
