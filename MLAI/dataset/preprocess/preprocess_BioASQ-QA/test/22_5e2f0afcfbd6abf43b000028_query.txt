Co-culture of bone marrow stromal cells (BMSCs) and vascular endothelial cells (VECs) is a promising strategy for better osteogenesis and pre-vascularization in bone tissue engineering. Recent reports have shown that mechanical stretching further promotes osteogenesis in BMSC/VEC co-culture systems, but the underlying mechanism of this process remains unclear. In this study, noncontact co-cultures of rat primary BMSCs and VECs were employed to interrogate paracrine cell-to-cell communications in response to tension. Exposure of VECs to 6% tension for 48 h elicited neither ALP activity nor mRNA expression of OCN and OPN in BMSCs incubated in a shared culture medium. Instead, BMSCs subjected to tension induced robust VEGF release, and its conditioned medium enhanced the proliferation and tubular formation of VECs with a concurrent increase in BMP-2 and IGF-1 production. Conditioned medium from activated VECs in turn promoted expression of osteogenic genes in BMSCs, followed by an increase in matrix mineralization. The addition of VEGF-R inhibitor Tivozanib to these systems abrogated the tension-induced paracrine effects on VECs and subsequently impaired BMSC osteogenesis. These results clearly demonstrate that the response of BMSCs to tension potentiates paracrine osteogenic signaling from VECs; this positive feedback loop is initiated by VEGF release.

Glioblastoma (GBM) remains one of the most fatal human malignancies due to its high angiogenic and infiltrative capacities. Even with optimal therapy including surgery, radiotherapy and temozolomide, it is essentially incurable. GBM is among the most neovascularised neoplasms and its malignant progression associates with striking neovascularisation, evidenced by vasoproliferation and endothelial cell hyperplasia. Targeting the pro-angiogenic pathways is therefore a promising anti-glioma strategy. Here we show that tivozanib, a pan-inhibitor of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) receptors, inhibited proliferation of GBM cells through a G2/M cell cycle arrest via inhibition of polo-like kinase 1 (PLK1) signalling pathway and down-modulation of Aurora kinases A and B, cyclin B1 and CDC25C. Moreover, tivozanib decreased adhesive potential of these cells through reduction of intercellular adhesion molecule-1 (ICAM-1) and vascular cell adhesion molecule-1 (VCAM-1). Tivozanib diminished GBM cell invasion through impairing the proteolytic cascade of cathepsin B/urokinase-type plasminogen activator (uPA)/matrix metalloproteinase-2 (MMP-2). Combination of tivozanib with EGFR small molecule inhibitor gefitinib synergistically increased sensitivity to gefitinib. Altogether, these findings suggest that VEGFR blockade by tivozanib has potential anti-glioma effects in vitro. Further in vivo studies are warranted to explore the anti-tumour activity of tivozanib in combinatorial approaches in GBM.

Tivozanib hydrochloride monohydrate (tivozanib; formerly KRN-951, AV-951) is a potent pan-VEGF receptor tyrosine kinase inhibitor. The biological activity of tivozanib seems to outstand that of other VEGF tyrosine kinase inhibitors. In Phase I studies, observed side effects are generally mild, with hypertension being the most common adverse event. In single-agent Phase II and III studies in patients with advanced or metastatic renal cell carcinoma, tivozanib has demonstrated convincing clinical activity. Further clinical trials of tivozanib combined with various cytotoxic drug regimens as well as other classes of target-specific anticancer agents (e.g., mTOR inhibitors) for other indications are underway. Tivozanib has not yet been approved for regular use.

Tivozanib is a potent and selective tyrosine kinase inhibitor of vascular endothelial growth factor receptor-1(VEGFR1), -2(VEGFR2), and -3(VEGFR3). Analog of Tivozanib with deuterium-for-hydrogen replacement in metabolically active site was prepared and evaluated in vitro. Compared to its prototype, deuterated Tivozanib compound HC-1144 retained in vitro activity against VEGFR tyrosine kinases. In vivo pharmacokinetic studies indicated HC-1144 clearly altered the blood circulation behavior, which was proved by significantly prolonged blood circulation half life time (t1/2) and increased AUC0-∞. Therefore, HC-1144 has the potential to be a novel inhibitor against VEGFR tyrosine kinases with long-acting plasma exposure.

Epithelial ovarian cancer (EOC) is the most fatal gynaecological malignancy. Despite initial therapeutic response, the majority of advanced-stage patients relapse and succumb to chemoresistant disease. Overcoming drug resistance is the key to successful treatment of EOC. Members of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) family are overexpressed in EOC and play key roles in its malignant progression though their contribution in development of the chemoresistant disease remains elusive. Here we show that expression of the VEGF family is higher in therapy-resistant EOC cells compared to sensitive ones. Overexpression of VEGFR2 correlated with resistance to cisplatin and combination with VEGFR2-inhibitor apatinib synergistically increased cisplatin sensitivity. Tivozanib, a pan-inhibitor of VEGF receptors, reduced proliferation of the chemoresistant EOC cells through induction of G2/M cell cycle arrest and apoptotic cell death. Tivozanib decreased invasive potential of these cells, concomitant with reduction of intercellular adhesion molecule-1 (ICAM-1) and diminishing the enzymatic activity of urokinase-type plasminogen activator (uPA) and matrix metalloproteinase-2 (MMP-2). Moreover, tivozanib synergistically enhanced anti-tumour effects of EGFR-directed therapies including erlotinib. These findings suggest that the VEGF pathway has potential as a therapeutic target in therapy-resistant EOC and VEGFR blockade by tivozanib may yield stronger anti-tumour efficacy and circumvent resistance to EGFR-directed therapies.

Tivozanib is a novel vascular endothelial growth factor receptor tyrosine kinase inhibitor (VEGF TKI). Among other VEGF TKIs, tivozanib stands apart due to its selective kinase inhibitory properties as well as its high potency for inhibiting VEGF receptors 1 and 2. Tivozanib has been evaluated in several clinical trials including a Phase I and Phase II trial demonstrating safety and efficacy for patients with advanced clear cell renal cell carcinoma (RCC). A pivotal randomized Phase III trial comparing the front-line use of tivozanib to sorafenib in patients with metastatic clear cell RCC has been reported. The clinical development of tivozanib and results of these important studies will be reviewed. Also, the potential placement of tivozanib among currently US Food and Drug Administration approved agents for advanced RCC will be discussed.

Tivozanib is a potent and highly specific orally available, tyrosine kinase inhibitor that targets vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) receptor-1, VEGF receptor-2, and VEGF receptor-3 at very low concentrations with a long half-life (4 days). After its promising activity in xenograft and preclinical models, tivozanib was evaluated in early phase clinical trials in various solid tumors. The phase III trial (TIVO-1) compared tivozanib with sorafenib in metastatic clear cell renal cell carcinoma (RCC). Because of detrimental overall survival (OS), Oncology Drug Advisory Committee (ODAC) voted against its approval in RCC. Tivozanib is also being evaluated in various other solid tumors like breast, gastrointestinal cancers, hepatocellular cancer, sarcomas, and gynecological cancer. In BATON-CRC trial, low-serum neuropilin-1 (NRP-1) levels were associated with better progression-free survival (PFS) in patients treated with tivozanib. The NRP-1 will be evaluated as a biomarker for tivozanib response in future clinical trials. Ongoing clinical trial will further characterize activity of tivozanib in hepatocellular carcinoma, sarcomas, and gynecologic cancers.

Soft tissue sarcomas (STSs) overexpress vascular endothelial growth factors (VEGF) and VEGF-receptors (VEGFR) activation have been associated with tumor aggressiveness. Tivozanib is a potent small molecule tyrosine kinase inhibitor against VEGFR1-3, with activity against PDGFRα/β and cKIT. The primary endpoint of this study was progression free survival (PFS) rate at 16 weeks. Secondary end points were overall survival (OS), response rate, safety and correlative studies. A Simon two-stage phase II trial was performed using tivozanib given orally at 1.5 mg daily, 3 week on 1 week off on a 28 day cycle until disease progression or intolerable toxicity. Fifty-eight patients were enrolled and treated with tivozanib. Leiomyosarcoma was the most common STS histological type in our cohort (47%) and 27 patients (46%) had received at least 3 lines of therapy prior to study entry. Up to 24 patients (41%) had prior VEGF targeted therapies. Partial response and stable disease were observed in 2 (3.6%) and 30 (54.5%) patients. The 16 week PFS rate was 36.4% [95% confidence interval (CI) 23.7-49.1] and a median PFS of 3.5 months (95% CI 1.8-3). Median OS observed was 12.2 months (95% CI 8.1-16.8). The most frequent all grade toxicities were fatigue (48.3%), hypertension (43.1%), nausea (31%) and diarrhea (27.6%). The most common grade three toxicity was hypertension (22.4%). Correlative studies demonstrate no correlation between the expression of VEGFR 1, 2 or 3, PDGFRα/β or FGF, and activity of tivozanib. Tivozanib was well tolerated and showed antitumor activity with a promising median PFS and PFS rate at 4 months in a heavily pretreated population of metastatic STSs. Our results support further studies to assess the clinical efficacy of tivozanib in STS. NCT01782313.

Tivozanib (Fotivda<sup>®</sup>) is an oral, potent and highly selective vascular endothelial growth factor receptor (VEGFR) inhibitor that has been approved in the EU, Iceland and Norway for the first-line treatment of adult patients with advanced renal cell carcinoma (RCC) and for adult patients who are VEGFR and mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) pathway inhibitor-naive following disease progression after one prior treatment with cytokine therapy for advanced RCC. Tivozanib is at various stages of development in other countries for advanced RCC and advanced solid tumours. This article summarizes the milestones in the development of tivozanib leading to this first global approval in Europe for the treatment of adults with advanced RCC.

Tivozanib hydrochloride (tivozanib) is a potent and selective tyrosine kinase inhibitor of all 3 vascular endothelial growth factor receptors with antitumor activity additive to 5-fluorouracil in preclinical models. This study was conducted to determine maximum tolerated dose (MTD), dose-limiting toxicities (DLTs), pharmacokinetics (PKs), and antitumor activity of escalating doses of tivozanib with a modified (m)FOLFOX-6 (leucovorin, 5-fluorouracil [5-FU], and 85 mg/kg(2) oxaliplatin) regimen in patients with advanced gastrointestinal tumors. Tivozanib was administered orally once daily for 21 days in 28-day cycles, with mFOLFOX-6 administered every 14 days. Patients were allowed to continue tivozanib after discontinuation of mFOLFOX-6. Thirty patients were assigned to tivozanib 0.5 mg (n = 9), 1.0 mg (n = 3), or 1.5 mg (n = 18) with mFOLFOX-6. Patients received a median of 5.2 (range, 0.03-26.9) months of tivozanib. DLTs were observed in 2 patients: Grade 3/4 transaminase level increases with tivozanib 0.5 mg, and Grade 3 dizziness with tivozanib 1.5 mg. Other Grade 3/4 adverse events included hypertension (n = 8), fatigue (n = 8), and neutropenia (n = 6). MTD for tivozanib with mFOLFOX-6 was confirmed as 1.5 mg. No PK interactions between tivozanib and mFOLFOX-6 were observed. One patient had an ongoing clinical complete response, 10 had a partial response, and 11 obtained prolonged stable disease. Tivozanib and mFOLFOX-6 is feasible and appears to be safe. The recommended dose for tivozanib with mFOLFOX-6 is 1.5 mg/d. Observed clinical activity merits further exploration in gastrointestinal tumors.

This study aimed to investigate the mechanism of reversal of multidrug resistance mediated by ABC transporters with tivozanib (AV-951 and KRN-951). Tivozanib is a potent inhibitor of VEGF-1, -2 and -3 receptors. ABCB1- and ABCG2-overexpressing cell lines were treated with respective substrate antineoplastic agents in the presence or absence of tivozanib. The results indicate that tivozanib can significantly reverse ABCB1-mediated resistance to paclitaxel, vinblastine and colchicine, as well as ABCG2-mediated resistance to mitoxantrone, SN-38 and doxorubicin. Drug efflux assays showed that tivozanib increased the intracellular accumulation of substrates by inhibiting the ABCB1 and ABCG2 efflux activity. Furthermore, at a higher concentration, tivozanib inhibited the ATPase activity of both ABCB1 and ABCG2 and inhibited the photolabeling of ABCB1 or ABCG2. We conclude that tivozanib at noncytotoxic concentrations has the previously unknown activity of reversing multidrug resistance mediated by ABCB1 and ABCG2 transporters.

Tivozanib hydrochloride (tivozanib) is a potent, selective tyrosine kinase inhibitor of the vascular endothelial growth factor receptors 1, 2, and 3, with a long half-life. This Phase I study evaluated the effect of food on tivozanib pharmacokinetics (PK). A single oral dose of tivozanib was administered to healthy subjects in a fasted/fed and a fed/fasted state. Thirty subjects enrolled; 29 completed the study. Maximum concentration (Cmax ) in the fed state was lower than in the fasted state (geometric means, 14.1 and 18.1 ng/mL). The geometric mean ratio (90% confidence interval) (fed/fasted states) for Cmax was 77.5% (72.9-82.4%), indicating a food effect on Cmax . There was no difference in tivozanib area under the curve to infinity (AUC0-∞ ) between states (geometric means, 2,377 and 2,198 ng h/mL). Geometric mean ratios also indicated no food effect on tivozanib AUC0-∞ . Other PK parameters were similar between states. The most commonly reported adverse events affected the gastrointestinal system and were mild in intensity. There were no clinically significant changes in other safety measures. In conclusion, food does not have an impact on the AUC0-∞ of tivozanib but does decrease Cmax approximately 23%, suggesting that this agent can be dosed with or without food.

Tivozanib is a selective inhibitor of vascular endothelial growth factor receptors 1, 2 and 3 tyrosine kinases. This open-label, crossover clinical study (AV-951-09-902) provided access to tivozanib for patients who progressed on sorafenib in TIVO-1, comparing tivozanib with sorafenib in patients with advanced renal cell carcinoma (RCC). Patients enrolled in this single-arm, phase 2 crossover study were previously randomised to sorafenib on TIVO-1, progressed and then crossed over to tivozanib. Patients received tivozanib (1.5 mg/day orally; 3 weeks on/1 week off) within 4 weeks after their last sorafenib dose. Crossover patients were exposed to tivozanib for a median of eight cycles. From the start of tivozanib treatment, median progression-free survival was 11.0 months (95% confidence interval [CI]: 7.3-12.7) and median overall survival was 21.6 months (95% CI: 17.0-27.6). Best overall response was partial response in 29 (18%) patients and stable disease in 83 (52%) patients, with a median duration of response of 15.2 and 12.7 months, respectively. About 77% of patients experienced adverse events, most frequently hypertension (26%), followed by diarrhoea (14%) and fatigue (13%); 53% of patients had treatment-related adverse events, including 24% grade ≥3. About 9% and 16% of patients had dose reductions and dose interruptions due to adverse events, respectively. A total of 30% of patients had serious adverse events, and 4% had treatment-related serious adverse events. This crossover study of patients with advanced RCC demonstrated potent tivozanib anti-tumour activity. Safety and tolerability profiles were acceptable and consistent with the established adverse event profile of tivozanib.

Tivozanib is a novel tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI) which inhibits vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) receptors-1, -2, and -3 at nanomolar concentrations. A comprehensive MEDLINE and American Society of Clinical Oncology abstract search was performed to gather all relevant clinical and translational data related to tivozanib. We discuss pre-clinical studies associated with tivozanib, and the results of a Phase I assessment in advanced solid tumors. We highlight combination studies with tivozanib, including pairings of tivozanib with cytotoxic therapy in patients with colorectal cancer and breast cancer. A randomized discontinuation Phase II study and a randomized Phase III study assessing the activity of tivozanib in metastatic renal cell carcinoma (mRCC) are described in detail. Tivozanib will face the challenge of entering an already crowded therapeutic space in mRCC-emerging combination studies and biomarker assessments may distinguish this agent among other VEGF-TKIs. The current review will outline the development pathway of tivozanib to date, and offer lessons learned and future opportunities.

Tivozanib is a potent and selective tyrosine kinase inhibitor of vascular endothelial growth factor receptor 1 (VEGFR1), -2, and -3. This phase III trial compared tivozanib with sorafenib as initial targeted therapy in patients with metastatic renal cell carcinoma (RCC). Patients with metastatic RCC, with a clear cell component, prior nephrectomy, measurable disease, and 0 or 1 prior therapies for metastatic RCC were randomly assigned to tivozanib or sorafenib. Prior VEGF-targeted therapy and mammalian target of rapamycin inhibitor were not permitted. The primary end point was progression-free survival (PFS) by independent review. A total of 517 patients were randomly assigned to tivozanib (n = 260) or sorafenib (n = 257). PFS was longer with tivozanib than with sorafenib in the overall population (median, 11.9 v 9.1 months; hazard ratio [HR], 0.797; 95% CI, 0.639 to 0.993; P = .042). One hundred fifty-six patients (61%) who progressed on sorafenib crossed over to receive tivozanib. The final overall survival (OS) analysis showed a trend toward longer survival on the sorafenib arm than on the tivozanib arm (median, 29.3 v 28.8 months; HR, 1.245; 95% CI, 0.954 to 1.624; P = .105). Adverse events (AEs) more common with tivozanib than with sorafenib were hypertension (44% v 34%) and dysphonia (21% v 5%). AEs more common with sorafenib than with tivozanib were hand-foot skin reaction (54% v 14%) and diarrhea (33% v 23%). Tivozanib demonstrated improved PFS, but not OS, and a differentiated safety profile, compared with sorafenib, as initial targeted therapy for metastatic RCC.

Targeting tumor angiogenesis is a potential therapeutic strategy for glioblastoma because of its high vascularization. Tivozanib is an oral pan-VEGF receptor tyrosine kinase inhibitor that hits a central pathway in glioblastoma angiogenesis. We conducted a phase II study to test the effectiveness of tivozanib in patients with recurrent glioblastoma. Ten adult patients were enrolled and treated with tivozanib 1.5 mg daily, 3 weeks on/1 week off in 28-day cycles. Brain MRI and blood biomarkers of angiogenesis were performed at baseline, within 24-72 h of treatment initiation, and monthly thereafter. Dynamic contrast enhanced MRI, dynamic susceptibility contrast MRI, and vessel architecture imaging were used to assess vascular effects. Resting state MRI was used to assess brain connectivity. Best RANO criteria responses were: 1 complete response, 1 partial response, 4 stable diseases, and 4 progressive disease (PD). Two patients were taken off study for toxicity and 8 patients were taken off study for PD. Median progression-free survival was 2.3 months and median overall survival was 8.1 months. Baseline abnormal tumor vascular permeability, blood flow, tissue oxygenation and plasma sVEGFR2 significantly decreased and plasma PlGF and VEGF increased after treatment, suggesting an anti-angiogenic effect of tivozanib. However, there were no clear structural changes in vasculature as vessel caliber and enhancing tumor volume did not significantly change. Despite functional changes in tumor vasculature, tivozanib had limited anti-tumor activity, highlighting the limitations of anti-VEGF monotherapy. Future studies in glioblastoma should leverage the anti-vascular activity of agents targeting VEGF to enhance the activity of other therapies.

The efficacy of VEGF-targeting therapies in clinical trials led to their recommendation in clinical guidelines for use across the advanced or metastatic renal cell carcinoma (RCC) treatment landscape, however, tolerability (including off-target effects) has remained a challenge. Tivozanib is a selective inhibitor of all three VEGFRs, with limited off-target interaction, which demonstrates efficacy with improved tolerability relative to multikinase VEGFR-TKIs. Areas covered: Covered here is the clinical development of tivozanib in advanced RCC, including the pivotal Phase III, multicenter, open-label, randomized clinical study comparing tivozanib with sorafenib for the treatment of VEGF- and mTOR therapy-naïve advanced RCC patients. Also covered are ongoing trials, exploring the efficacy and safety of tivozanib in the setting of refractory disease and the utility of tivozanib in combination with checkpoint inhibitors for advanced RCC. Combination of a VEGFR-TKI and immunotherapy is promising in advanced RCC, if the treatment regimens have acceptable tolerability. Here the selectivity of tivozanib may contribute to an acceptable tolerability profile when used in combination therapy. Expert commentary: The approval of tivozanib provides an additional option for the first-line treatment of advanced or metastatic RCC patients in Europe and allows use of a VEGFR-TKI with selectivity for VEGFRs in this setting.

We investigated the effects of tivozanib, an oral vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) receptor tyrosine kinase inhibitor, on experimental choroidal neovascularization (CNV) in mice. C57BL/6 mice were treated with tivozanib (1 mg/kg/day) or vehicle at the onset (day 0) of the study and experimental CNV was induced by laser photocoagulation the following day. In the other groups, tivozanib or vehicle was started 7 days after the laser photocoagulation to determine the effects of the drug on established CNV. To evaluate changes in the CNV lesions, choroidal flat mounts, fluorescein angiography, immunofluorescence staining with isolectin B4, and histological examinations were performed 14 days after CNV induction. Expression of phosphorylated ERK1/2 in choroidal tissues was measured by western blot analysis to demonstrate the inhibitory effect of tivozanib on intracellular signaling pathways involved in CNV development. Compared to vehicle-treatment, tivozanib suppressed the development of CNV lesions and led to a significant regression of established CNV, reducing the affected areas by 80.7% and 67.7%, respectively. On fluorescein angiography, tivozanib-treated mice had significantly less fluorescence leakage than vehicle-treated mice (P < 0.001). On immunofluorescence staining, the isolectin B4-labeled area was smaller in tivozanib-treated mice (P < 0.001). Phosphorylated ERK 1/2 levels increased after CNV induction by laser application and were suppressed by tivozanib treatment. Tivozanib effectively inhibited the progression of CNV in an experimental CNV model. These results suggest that tivozanib may be a therapeutic alternative for the treatment of neovascular age-related macular degeneration.

Tivozanib is a potent and selective inhibitor of vascular endothelial growth factor receptor (VEGFR) tyrosine kinases. A previous clinical trial in the EU and USA indicated that tivozanib at the maximum tolerated dose of 1.5 mg/day showed an antitumor activity in patients with renal cell carcinoma. This Japanese phase I study was designed to determine the recommended phase II dose of tivozanib for Japanese patients; secondary objectives included pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic profiles and preliminary efficacy. Daily treatment with tivozanib in a 3-weeks-on/1-week-off cycle was examined in nine Japanese patients with advanced solid tumors in the 3 + 3 design (Level 1, 1.0 mg; Level 2, 1.5 mg). No dose-limiting toxicity was observed throughout the study, and the maximum tolerated dose was not reached. The most commonly observed drug-related adverse events were diarrhea, dysphonia, rash, thyroid stimulating hormone increase, and with severity grade ≥3, hand-foot skin reaction, hypertension, and proteinuria. Those adverse events were generally well-manageable and mostly resolved within the tolerability evaluation period. Serum exposure to tivozanib resulted in t1/2 of more than >60 h. Increase of plasma VEGF and decrease of plasma VEGFR-1 and VEGFR-2 were observed 1-3 weeks after tivozanib treatment. Although no complete or partial response was observed, long-term stable disease continuing more than 170 days was observed in three renal cell carcinoma patients who had failed prior VEGFR inhibitors. In conclusion, 1.5 mg/day of tivozanib in a 3-weeks-on/1-week-off setting was tolerable in Japanese patients, and was recommended for further clinical trials in the Japanese population. Clinical trial Registration No: JapicCTI-090854.

The vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) pathway is associated with the promotion of endothelial cell proliferation, migration, and survival necessary for angiogenesis. VEGF and its three receptor isoforms are often overexpressed in many human solid tumors. Tivozanib is a potent, selective inhibitor of VEGF receptors 1, 2, and 3, with a long half-life. The purpose of these studies was to evaluate the effect of ketoconazole, a potent inhibitor of CYP3A4, and rifampin, a potent inducer of CYP3A4, on the pharmacokinetics of tivozanib. Two phase I, open-label, 2-period, single-sequence studies evaluated the effect of steady-state ketoconazole (NCT01363778) or rifampin (NCT01363804) on the pharmacokinetic profile, safety, and tolerability of a single oral 1.5-mg dose of tivozanib. Tivozanib was well tolerated in both studies. Steady-state ketoconazole did not cause a clinically significant change in the pharmacokinetics of a single dose of tivozanib; therefore, dosing of tivozanib with a CYP3A4 pathway inhibitor should not cause a clinically significant change in serum tivozanib levels. However, coadministration of tivozanib with rifampin caused a significant decrease in the area under the curve from 0 to infinity and half-life and an increase in clearance of tivozanib, which suggest increased clearance via the enhanced CYP3A4-mediated metabolism of tivozanib.

To assess the maximum tolerated dose (MTD)/dose-limiting toxicities (DLT), safety, pharmacokinetics, and pharmacodynamics of tivozanib, a potent and selective oral VEGF receptor (VEGFR) tyrosine kinase inhibitor. Dose levels of 1.0, 1.5, and 2.0 mg/d tivozanib for 28 days followed by 14 days of medication were explored in patients with advanced solid tumors. Forty-one patients were enrolled. Animal data incorrectly predicted toxicity, resulting in DLTs at the starting dose (2.0 mg) consisting of grade 3 proteinuria and hypertension and grade 3 ataxia. At 1.0 mg, no DLT was observed. At an intermediate dose (1.5 mg), 1 patient experienced DLT consisting of grade 3 hypertension. This dose was determined as the MTD. Of 10 additional patients treated at 1.5 mg, 1 patient each experienced grade 3 hypertension and grade 3 fatigue, and 2 patients experienced grade 3 and 4 transaminase elevation. In 12 additional patients treated at 1.0 mg, no DLT was observed. Pharmacokinetics displayed long absorption time, dose proportional exposure, and a half-life of 4.7 days. Plasma levels of VEGF-A and soluble VEGFR-2 showed dose-dependent increases and decreases, respectively. Dynamic contrast-enhanced MRI indicated reduction in tumor perfusion. Clinical activity was observed in renal cell cancer, colorectal cancer, and other tumors. Tivozanib was well tolerated with manageable side effects. The pharmacokinetics profile revealed that tivozanib was suitable for once-daily dosing. Encouraging and durable clinical activity was observed. The recommended daily dose of tivozanib in a 4-week-on and 2-week-off dosing regimen is 1.5 mg.

The antitumor activity and safety of tivozanib, which is a potent and selective vascular endothelial growth factor receptor-1, -2, and -3 inhibitor, was assessed in patients with advanced/metastatic renal cell carcinoma (RCC). In this phase II, randomized discontinuation trial, 272 patients received open-label tivozanib 1.5 mg/d (one cycle equaled three treatment weeks followed by a 1-week break) orally for 16 weeks. Thereafter, 78 patients who demonstrated ≥ 25% tumor shrinkage continued to take tivozanib, and 118 patients with less than 25% tumor change were randomly assigned to receive tivozanib or a placebo in a double-blind manner; patients with ≥ 25% tumor growth were discontinued. Primary end points included safety, the objective response rate (ORR) at 16 weeks, and the percentage of randomly assigned patients who remained progression free after 12 weeks of double-blind treatment; secondary end points included progression-free survival (PFS). Of 272 patients enrolled onto the study, 83% of patients had clear-cell histology, 73% of patients had undergone nephrectomy, and 54% of patients were treatment naive. The ORR after 16 weeks of tivozanib treatment was 18% (95% CI, 14% to 23%). Of the 118 randomized patients, significantly more patients who were randomly assigned to receive double-blind tivozanib remained progression free after 12 weeks versus patients who received the placebo (49% v 21%; P = .001). Throughout the study, the ORR was 24% (95% CI, 19% to 30%), and the median PFS was 11.7 months (95% CI, 8.3 to 14.3 months) in the overall study population. The most common grade 3 and 4 treatment-related adverse event was hypertension (12%). Tivozanib was active and well tolerated in patients with advanced RCC. These data support additional development of tivozanib in advanced RCC.
