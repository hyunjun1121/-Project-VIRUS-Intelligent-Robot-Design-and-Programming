PD-1 axis blockade, in combination with chemotherapy, improves outcomes in advanced triple-negative breast cancer that is PD-L1 positive. The phase 3 KEYNOTE-522 trial now shows that the addition of pembrolizumab to chemotherapy improves pathological complete response rates regardless of PD-L1 status and appears to improve survival.

In both the IMpassion 130 trial in the metastatic setting and in Keynote 522 in the neoadjuvant setting, patients with triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) showed benefit from PD-1 axis immunotherapy. Here, we assess PD-L1 expression on both tumor and immune cells using quantitative immunofluorescence to assess association with benefit from neoadjuvant durvalumab concurrent with chemotherapy in TNBC. Pretreatment core needle biopsies (<i>n</i> = 69) were obtained from patients who participated in a phase I/II clinical trial (NCT02489448). The final analysis included 45 patients [pathologic complete response (pCR) = 18, non-pCR = 27] due to technical issues and insufficient tissue. Slides were stained using a previously validated Ultivue DNA-based Ultimapper kit (CD8, CD68, PD-L1, Cytokeratin/Sox10, and Hoechst counterstain). The PD-L1 expression was analyzed by molecular compartmentalization without segmentation using AQUA software (version 3.2.2.1) in three tissue compartments including tumor (cytokeratin-positive cells), CD68<sup>+</sup> cells, and overall stroma. In patients with pCR, PD-L1 expression was significantly higher in tumor cells, in CD68<sup>+</sup> cells and in the stroma compared with patients non-pCR. There was no difference in the amount of CD68<sup>+</sup> cells in the tumor or stromal compartments between cases with pCR and non-pCR. Expression of PD-L1 in tumor cells, immune cells in stroma, and colocalized with CD68<sup>+</sup> cells is associated with higher rates of pCR to durvalumab and chemotherapy in TNBC.

Previous trials showed promising antitumor activity and an acceptable safety profile associated with pembrolizumab in patients with early triple-negative breast cancer. Whether the addition of pembrolizumab to neoadjuvant chemotherapy would significantly increase the percentage of patients with early triple-negative breast cancer who have a pathological complete response (defined as no invasive cancer in the breast and negative nodes) at definitive surgery is unclear. In this phase 3 trial, we randomly assigned (in a 2:1 ratio) patients with previously untreated stage II or stage III triple-negative breast cancer to receive neoadjuvant therapy with four cycles of pembrolizumab (at a dose of 200 mg) every 3 weeks plus paclitaxel and carboplatin (784 patients; the pembrolizumab-chemotherapy group) or placebo every 3 weeks plus paclitaxel and carboplatin (390 patients; the placebo-chemotherapy group); the two groups then received an additional four cycles of pembrolizumab or placebo, and both groups received doxorubicin-cyclophosphamide or epirubicin-cyclophosphamide. After definitive surgery, the patients received adjuvant pembrolizumab or placebo every 3 weeks for up to nine cycles. The primary end points were a pathological complete response at the time of definitive surgery and event-free survival in the intention-to-treat population. At the first interim analysis, among the first 602 patients who underwent randomization, the percentage of patients with a pathological complete response was 64.8% (95% confidence interval [CI], 59.9 to 69.5) in the pembrolizumab-chemotherapy group and 51.2% (95% CI, 44.1 to 58.3) in the placebo-chemotherapy group (estimated treatment difference, 13.6 percentage points; 95% CI, 5.4 to 21.8; P<0.001). After a median follow-up of 15.5 months (range, 2.7 to 25.0), 58 of 784 patients (7.4%) in the pembrolizumab-chemotherapy group and 46 of 390 patients (11.8%) in the placebo-chemotherapy group had disease progression that precluded definitive surgery, had local or distant recurrence or a second primary tumor, or died from any cause (hazard ratio, 0.63; 95% CI, 0.43 to 0.93). Across all treatment phases, the incidence of treatment-related adverse events of grade 3 or higher was 78.0% in the pembrolizumab-chemotherapy group and 73.0% in the placebo-chemotherapy group, including death in 0.4% (3 patients) and 0.3% (1 patient), respectively. Among patients with early triple-negative breast cancer, the percentage with a pathological complete response was significantly higher among those who received pembrolizumab plus neoadjuvant chemotherapy than among those who received placebo plus neoadjuvant chemotherapy.

Pembrolizumab plus chemotherapy may be an effective neoadjuvant treatment for triple-negative breast cancer. In the phase III KEYNOTE-522 trial, patients treated with the PD-1 inhibitor in combination with chemotherapy prior to surgery were more likely to have a pathologic complete response than patients who received chemotherapy alone, regardless of PD-L1 levels.

Immunotherapy is currently approved for a subset of patients diagnosed with advanced triple negative breast cancer (TNBC), based on the phase III randomized controlled trial, IMpassion130. The anti-programmed cell death ligand-1 (PD-L1) immune checkpoint inhibitor atezolizumab combined with nanoparticle albumin-bound (nab)-paclitaxel is currently the standard first-line therapy in patients with metastatic TNBC who have a PD-L1-positive peritumoral immune infiltrate. Although this approval is limited to only a subset of patients, strategies to expand indications in breast cancer for this treatment modality are beingÂ extensively evaluated. A substantial need exists for the identification of patient characteristics, disease settings, immune markers, ideal partners for combination with immune checkpoint inhibitors, and the ideal sequence with traditional anticancer therapies. Additionally, in light of the results of the KEYNOTE-522 study of adjuvant pembrolizumab in TNBC, evaluation of immunotherapy in the early disease setting is a subject of great interest. This review article discusses current knowledge on immune checkpoint inhibitors in clinical practice, and provides an overview of a variety of markers evaluated to predict benefit of immunotherapy and of promising new strategies to enhance immune response and enable more patients to benefit from immunotherapy.
