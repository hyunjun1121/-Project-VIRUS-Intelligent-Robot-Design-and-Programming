Hamptonâ€™s hump is characteristic to which disease?

[PMID: 24862753]
A 56-year-old man presented to the Accident and Emergency Department with pleuritic chest pain of sudden onset. He gave a history of short-distance air travel ten days earlier. Chest radiograph showed a peripheral-based opacity in the right lower zone, which was not seen in a previous study done three months ago, suggestive of Hampton's hump. The D-dimer level was raised. Computed tomography pulmonary angiography confirmed the diagnosis of pulmonary embolism in a right lower lobe segmental branch, with adjacent collapsed lung, consistent with lung infarction. The patient was started on heparin injection with significant relief of his symptoms. The clinical and imaging features of pulmonary embolism are described, with emphasis on the historical radiographic signs and the current dual-energy computed tomography innovations.

To determine the sensitivity, specificity, and positive and negative predictive values of chest radiographic findings in patients suspected of having acute pulmonary embolism (PE). Chest radiographs of 1,063 patients with suspected PE were reviewed. PE was confirmed angiographically in 383 patients and excluded in 680 patients. The chest radiograph was interpreted as normal in only 12% of patients with PE. The most common chest radiographic finding in patients with PE was atelectasis and/or parenchymal areas of increased opacity; however, the prevalence was not significantly different from that in patients without PE. Oligemia (the Westermark sign), prominent central pulmonary artery (the Fleischner sign), pleural-based area of increased opacity (the Hampton hump), vascular redistribution, pleural effusion, elevated diaphragm, and enlarged hilum were also poor predictors of PE. Although chest radiographs are essential in the investigation of suspected PE, their main value is to exclude diagnoses that clinically mimic PE and to aid in the interpretation of the ventilation-perfusion scan.

We discuss a case of a 20-year-old woman presenting with chest pain found to have a Hampton's hump on chest x-ray and corresponding wedge infarct on computed tomographic scan. Contrary to our suspicion that this febrile and tachycardic patient had a pulmonary embolism, she was later determined to have a septic embolus secondary to endocarditis. We highlight the difficulties in diagnosing certain cases of endocarditis in the emergency department, as well as the difficulties in distinguishing septic emboli from pulmonary emboli,especially with plain radiographs.
