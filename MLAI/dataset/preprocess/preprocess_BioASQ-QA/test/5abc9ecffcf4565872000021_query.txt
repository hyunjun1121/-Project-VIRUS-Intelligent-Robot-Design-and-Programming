Where do mitochondrial DNA deletion breakpoints tend to occur?

[PMID: 25193669]
Mitochondrial DNA deletions are prominent in human genetic disorders, cancer, and aging. It is thought that stalling of the mitochondrial replication machinery during DNA synthesis is a prominent source of mitochondrial genome instability; however, the precise molecular determinants of defective mitochondrial replication are not well understood. In this work, we performed a computational analysis of the human mitochondrial genome using the "Pattern Finder" G-quadruplex (G4) predictor algorithm to assess whether G4-forming sequences reside in close proximity (within 20 base pairs) to known mitochondrial DNA deletion breakpoints. We then used this information to map G4P sequences with deletions characteristic of representative mitochondrial genetic disorders and also those identified in various cancers and aging. Circular dichroism and UV spectral analysis demonstrated that mitochondrial G-rich sequences near deletion breakpoints prevalent in human disease form G-quadruplex DNA structures. A biochemical analysis of purified recombinant human Twinkle protein (gene product of c10orf2) showed that the mitochondrial replicative helicase inefficiently unwinds well characterized intermolecular and intramolecular G-quadruplex DNA substrates, as well as a unimolecular G4 substrate derived from a mitochondrial sequence that nests a deletion breakpoint described in human renal cell carcinoma. Although G4 has been implicated in the initiation of mitochondrial DNA replication, our current findings suggest that mitochondrial G-quadruplexes are also likely to be a source of instability for the mitochondrial genome by perturbing the normal progression of the mitochondrial replication machinery, including DNA unwinding by Twinkle helicase.

We have recently described an autosomal dominant hereditary inclusion body myopathy (h-IBM). Clinically it is is characterized by congenital joint contractures and slowly progressive, proximal muscle weakness and ophthalmoplegia. There is deterioration of muscle function between 30 and 50 years of age. While young patients show minor pathological changes in muscle, the middle-aged and old patients show rimmed vacuoles and inclusions of filaments measuring 15-18 nm in diameter. Except for the absence of significant inflammation the histopathology is similar to that found in sporadic inclusion body myositis (s-IBM). In s-IBM mitochondrial alterations including cytochrome c oxidase (COX) -deficient muscle fibers are common. These are due to multiple mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) deletions. In this study we investigated the occurrence of mitochondrial alterations in autosomal dominant h-IBM. Young affected individuals showed no mitochondrial changes but three patients aged 38, 51 and 59 years, respectively, showed ragged red fibers and COX-deficient muscle fibers. Polymerase chain reaction analysis showed multiple mtDNA deletions. By in situ hybridization clonal expansions of mtDNA with deletions were demonstrated in COX-deficient muscle fibers. Most of the analyzed deletion breakpoints showed nucleotide repeats flanking the deletions. The results show that COX-deficient muscle fibers and somatic mtDNA deletions are present in this family with h-IBM. The same factors may be involved in the development of mtDNA deletions in s-IBM and this family with h-IBM.

Next-generation sequencing (NGS) based on massively parallel sequencing (MPS) of the entire 16,569 bp mitochondrial genome generates thousands of reads for each nucleotide position. The high-throughput sequence data generated allow the detection of mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) point mutations and deletions with the ability to accurately quantify the mtDNA point mutation heteroplasmy and to determine the deletion breakpoints. In addition, this method is particularly sensitive for the detection of low-level mtDNA large deletions and multiple deletions. It is by far the most powerful tool for molecular diagnosis of mtDNA disorders.

Mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) deletions are a primary cause of mitochondrial disease and are believed to contribute to the aging process and to various neurodegenerative diseases. Despite strong observational and experimental evidence, the molecular basis of the deletion process remains obscure. In this study, we test the hypothesis that the primary cause of mtDNA vulnerability to breakage resides in the formation of non-B DNA conformations, namely hairpin, cruciform and cloverleaf-like elements. Using the largest database of human mtDNA deletions built thus far (753 different cases), we show that site-specific breakage hotspots exist in the mtDNA. Furthermore, we discover that the most frequent deletion breakpoints occur within or near predicted structures, a result that is supported by data from transgenic mice with mitochondrial disease. There is also a significant association between the folding energy of an mtDNA region and the number of breakpoints that it harbours. In particular, two clusters of hairpins (near the D-loop 3'-terminus and the L-strand origin of replication) are hotspots for mtDNA breakage. Consistent with our hypothesis, the highest number of 5'- and 3'-breakpoints per base is found in the highly structured tRNA genes. Overall, the data presented in this study suggest that non-B DNA conformations are a key element of the mtDNA deletion process.

The large majority of mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) deletions analyzed from mitochondrial myopathies and aging humans have been found to be flanked by direct repeats, a finding which has led to the slip-replication hypothesis of deletion formation. In this study, we have characterized 13 mtDNA deletion breakpoints from skeletal muscle harvested from 9- to 27-year-old rhesus monkeys. Seven of the deletions, five of which were unique to a particular animal, did not have direct repeats at the deletion breakpoints. In contrast, two of the three deletions common to several animals had direct repeats flanking the breakpoints. It appears, therefore, that at least two different mechanisms exist by which mtDNA deletions are formed during aging, one requiring and one independent of flanking direct repeats. Furthermore, the species in which mtDNA deletions are detected may determine which mechanism predominates.

Mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) deletions cause disease and accumulate during aging, yet our understanding of the molecular mechanisms underlying their formation remains rudimentary. Guanine-quadruplex (GQ) DNA structures are associated with nuclear DNA instability in cancer; recent evidence indicates they can also form in mitochondrial nucleic acids, suggesting that these non-B DNA structures could be associated with mtDNA deletions. Currently, the multiple types of GQ sequences and their association with human mtDNA stability are unknown. Here, we show an association between human mtDNA deletion breakpoint locations (sites where DNA ends rejoin after deletion of a section) and sequences with G-quadruplex forming potential (QFP), and establish the ability of selected sequences to form GQ in vitro. QFP contain four runs of either two or three consecutive guanines (2G and 3G, respectively), and we identified four types of QFP for subsequent analysis: intrastrand 2G, intrastrand 3G, duplex derived interstrand (ddi) 2G, and ddi 3G QFP sequences. We analyzed the position of each motif set relative to either 5' or 3' unique mtDNA deletion breakpoints, and found that intrastrand QFP sequences, but not ddi QFP sequences, showed significant association with mtDNA deletion breakpoint locations. Moreover, a large proportion of these QFP sequences occur at smaller distances to breakpoints relative to distribution-matched controls. The positive association of 2G QFP sequences persisted when breakpoints were divided into clinical subgroups. We tested in vitro GQ formation of representative mtDNA sequences containing these 2G QFP sequences and detected robust GQ structures by UV-VIS and CD spectroscopy. Notably, the most frequent deletion breakpoints, including those of the "common deletion", are bounded by 2G QFP sequence motifs. The potential for GQ to influence mitochondrial genome stability supports a high-priority investigation of these structures and their regulation in normal and pathological mitochondrial biology. These findings emphasize the potential importance of helicases that subsequently resolve GQ to maintain the stability of the mitochondrial genome.
