IDEAL_ANSWER:
- Histone H3K27ac separates active from poised enhancers and predicts developmental state . In contrast, elements of the second class 'poised enhancers' are linked to genes inactive in hESCs . They are involved in orchestrating early steps in embryogenesis, such as gastrulation, mesoderm formation and neurulation .
- Enhancers cause a high level of transcription and activation of chromatin structure at target genes . Individual chromatin marks, such as H3K27ac, have been identified to distinguish active from inactive enhancers . In contrast, elements of the second class, which we term 'poised enhancers', are distinguished by the absence of H327ac and enrichment of histone H3 lysine 27 trimethylation .
- Conversion of inactive enhancers to an active state is marked by accumulation of H3K4me1 and H3K27ac histone marks.
- Hyperacetylation of histones H3 and H4, a mark of active chromatin, is established broadly across target loci by enhancers that function over long distances . In contrast, elements of the second class 'poised enhancers' are distinguished by the absence of H3K27ac and enrichment of histone H3 lysine 27 trimethylation . They are linked to genes inactive in hESCs and instead are involved in orchestrating early steps in embryogenesis, such as gastrulation and mesoderm formation .
- Monomethylation of histone H3 on Lys 27 (H3K27) is associated with active and inactive enhancers, respectively. An enhancer chromatin state signature associated withactive enhancers may be defined by high levels of H3 K27 acetylation, nucleosome displacement, hypersensitivity to sonication, and strong suppression of enhancer activity by DNase I.
- We demonstrate that UTX, in a demethylase activity-independent manner, facilitates conversion of inactive enhancers in embryonic stem cells to an active (H3K4me1+/H3K27ac+) state by recruiting and coupling the enzymatic functions of MLL4 and p300. This work reveals a previously unrecognized cooperativity among enhancer-associated chromatin modulators, including a unique function for UTX, in establishing an "active enhancer landscape" and defines a detailed mechanism for the joint deposition of H3K4me1 and H3K27ac.

EXACT_ANSWER:
- H3K27ac
- Histone 3 Lysine 27 acetylation
