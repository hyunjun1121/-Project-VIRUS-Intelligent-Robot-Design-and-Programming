Spermiogenesis is a postmeiotic process that drives development of round spermatids into fully elongated spermatozoa. Spermatid elongation is largely controlled post-transcriptionally after global silencing of mRNA synthesis from the haploid genome. Here, rats that differentially express EGFP from a lentiviral transgene during early and late steps of spermiogenesis were used to flow sort fractions of round and elongating spermatids. Mass-spectral analysis of 2D gel protein spots enriched >3-fold in each fraction revealed a heterogeneous RNA binding proteome (hnRNPA2/b1, hnRNPA3, hnRPDL, hnRNPK, hnRNPL, hnRNPM, PABPC1, PABPC4, PCBP1, PCBP3, PTBP2, PSIP1, RGSL1, RUVBL2, SARNP2, TDRD6, TDRD7) abundantly expressed in round spermatids prior to their elongation. Notably, each protein within this ontology cluster regulates alternative splicing, sub-cellular transport, degradation and/or translational repression of mRNAs. In contrast, elongating spermatid fractions were enriched with glycolytic enzymes, redox enzymes and protein synthesis factors. Retrogene-encoded proteins were over-represented among the most abundant elongating spermatid factors identified. Consistent with these biochemical activities, plus corresponding histological profiles, the identified RNA processing factors are predicted to collectively drive post-transcriptional expression of an alternative exome that fuels finishing steps of sperm maturation and fitness.

Tristetraprolin (TTP) is the prototype for a family of RNA binding proteins that bind the tumor necrosis factor (TNF) messenger RNA AU-rich element (ARE), causing deadenylation of the TNF poly(A) tail, RNA decay, and silencing of TNF protein production. Using mass spectrometry sequencing we identified poly(A) binding proteins-1 and -4 (PABP1 and PABP4) in high abundance and good protein coverage from TTP immunoprecipitates. PABP1 significantly enhanced TNF ARE binding by RNA EMSA and prevented TTP-initiated deadenylation in an in vitro macrophage assay of TNF poly(A) stability. Neomycin inhibited TTP-promoted deadenylation at concentrations shown to inhibit the deadenylases poly(A) ribonuclease and CCR4. Stably transfected RAW264.7 macrophages overexpressing PABP1 do not oversecrete TNF; instead they upregulate TTP protein without increasing TNF protein production. The PABP1 inhibition of deadenylation initiated by TTP does not require the poly(A) binding regions in RRM1 and RRM2, suggesting a more complicated interaction than simple masking of the poly(A) tail from a 3'-exonuclease. Like TTP, PABP1 is a substrate for p38 MAP kinase. Finally, PABP1 stabilizes cotransfected TTP in 293T cells and prevents the decrease in TTP levels seen with p38 MAP kinase inhibition. These findings suggest several levels of functional antagonism between TTP and PABP1 that have implications for regulation of unstable mRNAs like TNF.

Translational control of many mRNAs in developing metazoan embryos is achieved by alterations in their poly(A) tail length. A family of cytoplasmic poly(A)-binding proteins (PABPs) bind the poly(A) tail and can regulate mRNA translation and stability. However, despite the extensive biochemical characterization of one family member (PABP1), surprisingly little is known about their in vivo roles or functional relatedness. Because no information is available in vertebrates, we address their biological roles, establishing that each of the cytoplasmic PABPs conserved in Xenopus laevis [PABP1, embryonic PABP (ePABP), and PABP4] is essential for normal development. Morpholino-mediated knockdown of PABP1 or ePABP causes both anterior and posterior phenotypes and embryonic lethality. In contrast, depletion of PABP4 results mainly in anterior defects and lethality at later stages. Unexpectedly, cross-rescue experiments reveal that neither ePABP nor PABP4 can fully rescue PABP1 depletion, establishing that PABPs have distinct functions. Comparative analysis of the uncharacterized PABP4 with PABP1 and ePABP shows that it shares a mechanistically conserved core role in promoting global translation. Consistent with this analysis, each morphant displays protein synthesis defects, suggesting that their roles in mRNA-specific translational regulation and/or mRNA decay, rather than global translation, underlie the functional differences between PABPs. Domain-swap experiments reveal that the basis of the functional specificity is complex, involving multiple domains of PABPs, and is conferred, at least in part, by protein-protein interactions.

Cytoplasmic poly(A) binding protein 4 (PABPC4) is an RNA-processing protein that plays an important role in the regulation of gene expression. The aim of this study was to investigate the expression pattern and identify the potential clinical significance of PABPC4 in colorectal cancer. Immunohistochemical analysis revealed that 26.7% (27/101 patients) of primary colorectal tumors and 60.5% (23/38 patients) of corresponding adjacent, normal tissues showed high cytoplasmic expression of PABPC4, whereas expression was absent in 98% (43/44 patients) of distant, normal tissues. Using Kaplan-Meier analysis, we observed that the expression of PABPC4 was significantly correlated with disease-free survival and overall survival in patients with stage II and stage III colorectal cancer (P=0.022 and P=0.020, respectively). PABPC4 expression was positively associated with survival outcome, and may have predictive value in the prognosis of patients with colorectal cancer. Taken together, our findings indicate that PABPC4 may play a role in the pathogenesis of colorectal cancer.

In vertebrates, poly(A) binding protein (PABP) is known to exist in five different isoforms. PABPs are primarily cytosolic with the exception of the nuclear PABP (PABPN1), which is located in the nucleus. Within the nucleus, PABPN1 is believed to bind to the poly(A) tail of nascent mRNA and along with cleavage and polyadenylation specificity factor (CPSF) define the length of the newly synthesized poly(A) tail. The cellular role of PABP1 has been extensively studied over the years; however, the function of other PABPs remains poorly defined. In order to understand the role of PABPN1 in cellular mRNA metabolism and it's interrelation with other PABPs, we depleted PABPN1 using RNAi in HeLa and HEK293 cells. Our results show that PABPN1 depletion did not have any effect on the poly(A) tail length, nuclear export of mRNA, mRNA translation, and transcription. Rather, PABPN1 depletion resulted in a compensatory response as observed by increased level of PABP5 and nuclear accumulation of PABP4. In addition, PABP4 was associated with the poly(A) tract of pre-mRNA and CPSF in PABPN1 depleted cells. Nevertheless, PABPN1 depletion significantly affected cell survival as evidenced by an increase in apoptosis markers: phosphorylated p53 and PUMA and as judged by the expression of ER stress marker GRP78. Our results suggest that although function of PABPN1 may be compensated by nuclear translocation of PABP4 and perhaps by increase in the cytoplasmic abundance of PABP5, these were not sufficient to prevent apoptosis of cells. Thus PABPN1 may have a novel anti apoptotic role in mammalian cells.

Poly(A) binding protein (PABP) binds mRNA poly(A) tails and affects mRNA stability and translation. We show here that there is little free PABP in NIH3T3 cells, with the vast majority complexed with RNA. We found that PABP in NIH3T3 cytoplasmic lysates and recombinant human PABP can bind to AU-rich RNA with high affinity. Human PABP bound an AU-rich RNA with Kd in the nm range, which was only sixfold weaker than the affinity for oligo(A) RNA. Truncated PABP containing RNA recognition motif domains 3 and 4 retained binding to both AU-rich and oligo(A) RNA, whereas a truncated PABP containing RNA recognition motif domains 1 and 2 was highly selective for oligo(A) RNA. The inducible PABP, iPABP, was found to be even less discriminating than PABP in RNA binding, with affinities for AU-rich and oligo(A) RNAs differing by only twofold. These data suggest that iPABP and PABP may in some situations interact with other RNA regions in addition to the poly(A) tail.

Poly(A)-binding protein 1 (PABP1) has a fundamental role in the regulation of mRNA translation and stability, both of which are crucial for a wide variety of cellular processes. Although generally a diffuse cytoplasmic protein, it can be found in discrete foci such as stress and neuronal granules. Mammals encode several additional cytoplasmic PABPs that remain poorly characterised, and with the exception of PABP4, appear to be restricted in their expression to a small number of cell types. We have found that PABP4, similarly to PABP1, is a diffusely cytoplasmic protein that can be localised to stress granules. However, UV exposure unexpectedly relocalised both proteins to the nucleus. Nuclear relocalisation of PABPs was accompanied by a reduction in protein synthesis but was not linked to apoptosis. In examining the mechanism of PABP relocalisation, we found that it was related to a change in the distribution of poly(A) RNA within cells. Further investigation revealed that this change in RNA distribution was not affected by PABP knockdown but that perturbations that block mRNA export recapitulate PABP relocalisation. Our results support a model in which nuclear export of PABPs is dependent on ongoing mRNA export, and that a block in this process following UV exposure leads to accumulation of cytoplasmic PABPs in the nucleus. These data also provide mechanistic insight into reports that transcriptional inhibitors and expression of certain viral proteins cause relocation of PABP to the nucleus.

The poly(A)-binding protein (PABP) is an important translation initiation factor that binds to the polyadenylated 3' end of mRNA. We have previously shown that PABP2 interacts with the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) and VPg-Pro of turnip mosaic virus (TuMV) within virus-induced vesicles. At least eight PABP isoforms are produced in Arabidopsis thaliana, three of which (PABP2, PABP4 and PABP8) are highly and broadly expressed and probably constitute the bulk of PABP required for cellular functions. Upon TuMV infection, an increase in protein and mRNA expression from PAB2, PAB4 and PAB8 genes was recorded. In vitro binding assays revealed that RdRp and the viral genome-linked protein (VPg-Pro) interact preferentially with PABP2 but are also capable of interaction with one or both of the other class II PABPs (i.e. PABP4 and PABP8). To assess whether PABP is required for potyvirus replication, A. thaliana single and double pab knockouts were isolated and inoculated with TuMV. All lines showed susceptibility to TuMV. However, when precise monitoring of viral RNA accumulation was performed, it was found to be reduced by 2.2- and 3.5-fold in pab2 pab4 and pab2 pab8 mutants, respectively, when compared with wild-type plants. PABP levels were most significantly reduced in the membrane-associated fraction in both of these mutants. TuMV mRNA levels thus correlated with cellular PABP concentrations in these A. thaliana knockout lines. These data provide further support for a role of PABP in potyvirus replication.

The high-risk human papillomavirus (HPV) E6 and E7 oncoproteins are critical to the immortalization of keratinocytes. HPV type 16 (HPV16) E6 interacts with endogenous proteins to activate hTERT, the catalytic subunit of telomerase, thus avoiding cellular senescence signals. NFX1-123, the longer splice variant of NFX1, interacts with HPV16 E6, as well as cytoplasmic poly(A) binding proteins 1 and 4 (PABPC1 and PABPC4). HPV16 E6 affects hTERT expression posttranscriptionally through NFX1-123, as NFX1-123 interacts with hTERT mRNA and stabilizes it, leading to greater telomerase activity. The PAM2 motif of NFX1-123, with which it binds PABPCs, is required for the posttranscriptional regulation of hTERT by HPV16 E6 and NFX1-123. There is increasing evidence that RNA and DNA viruses utilize RNA-processing proteins, and specifically PABPCs, in the normal virus life cycle, and there is also evidence that RNA-processing proteins are perturbed in cancers. Here, we show that PABPCs are critical in hTERT regulation by HPV16 E6. Although the amount and cellular localization of PABPCs were largely unchanged in cervical cancer cell lines with or without HPV16 and in human foreskin keratinocytes (HFKs) with or without HPV16 E6, knockdown of PABPCs decreased hTERT mRNA and telomerase activity and overexpression of PABPC4 increased these in HPV16 E6-expressing HFKs. In contrast, knockdown of PABPCs in C33A cells had no effect on hTERT mRNA or telomerase activity. Additionally, overexpression of PABPC4 and hTERT led to greater growth of cultured HPV16 E6-expressing HFKs. This is the first evidence that PABPCs have a targeted role in hTERT regulation leading to a growth advantage in cells expressing HPV16 E6.

Cytoplasmic poly(A)-binding proteins (PABPs) regulate mRNA stability and translation. Although predominantly localized in the cytoplasm, PABP proteins also cycle through the nucleus. Recent work has established that their steady-state localization can be altered by cellular stresses such as ultraviolet (UV) radiation, and infection by several viruses, resulting in nuclear accumulation of PABPs. Here, we present further evidence that their interaction with and release from mRNA and translation complexes are important in determining their sub-cellular distribution and propose an integrated model for regulated nucleo-cytoplasmic transport of PABPs.

Tob is a member of an emerging family of anti-proliferative proteins that suppress cell growth when over-expressed. tob mRNA is highly expressed in anergic T cells and over-expression of Tob suppresses transcription of interleukin-2 (IL-2) through its interaction with Smads. Here, we identified two types of cDNA clones coding for poly(A)-binding protein (PABP) and inducible PABP (iPABP) by screening an expression cDNA library with the GST-Tob probe. Co-immunoprecipitation and GST-pull down experiments showed that Tob associated with the carboxyl-terminal region of iPABP. We then found that iPABP, like PABP, was involved in regulation of translation: iPABP enhanced translation of IL-2 mRNA in vitro. The enhanced translation of IL-2 mRNA required the 3'UTR and poly(A) sequences. Tob abrogated the enhancement of translation through its interaction with carboxyl-terminal region of iPABP in vitro. Consistently, over-expression of Tob in NIH3T3 cells, in which exogenous iPABP was stably expressed, resulted in suppression of IL-2 production from the simultaneously transfected IL-2 expression plasmid. Finally, Tob, whose expression was induced by anergic stimulation, was co-immunoprecipitated with iPABP in human T cells. These findings suggest that Tob is involved in the translational suppression of IL-2 mRNA in anergic T cells through its interaction with iPABP.
