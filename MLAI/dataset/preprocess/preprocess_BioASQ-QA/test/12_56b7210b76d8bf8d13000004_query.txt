Baicalein (5,6,7-trihydroxyflavone) (1) has been found to be active against a wide variety of cancer cells. However, the molecular mechanism underlying the effects of 1 on the induction of Ca(2+) movement and cytotoxicity in human breast cancer cells is unknown. This study examined the relationship between 1-induced Ca(2+) signaling and cytotoxicity in ZR-75-1 human breast cancer cells. The in vitro investigations reported herein produced the following results: (i) Compound 1 increased intracellular Ca(2+) concentration ([Ca(2+)]i) in a concentration-dependent manner. The signal was decreased by approximately 50% by removal of extracellular Ca(2+). (ii) Compound 1-triggered [Ca(2+)]i increases were significantly suppressed by store-operated Ca(2+) channel blockers 2-aminoethoxydiphenyl borate (2-APB) and the PKC inhibitor GF109203X. (iii) In Ca(2+)-free medium, compound 1-induced [Ca(2+)]i increases were also inhibited by GF109203X. Furthermore, pretreatment with the endoplasmic reticulum Ca(2+) pump inhibitor thapsigargin (TG) or 2,5-ditert-butylhydroquinone (BHQ) abolished 1-induced [Ca(2+)]i increases. Inhibition of phospholipase C (PLC) with U73122 abolished 1-induced [Ca(2+)]i increases. (iv) Compound 1 (20-40 μM) caused cytotoxicity, increased reactive oxygen species (ROS) production, and activated caspase-9/caspase-3. Furthermore, compound 1-induced apoptosis was significantly inhibited by prechelating cytosolic Ca(2+) with BAPTA-AM (1,2-bis(2-aminophenoxy)ethane-N,N,N',N'-tetraacetic acid acetoxymethyl ester) or by decreasing ROS with the antioxidant NAC (N-acetylcysteine). Together, baicalein (1) induced a [Ca(2+)]i increase by inducing PLC-dependent Ca(2+) release from the endoplasmic reticulum and Ca(2+) entry via PKC-dependent, 2-APB-sensitive store-operated Ca(2+) channels. Moreover, baicalein (1) induced Ca(2+)-associated apoptosis involved ROS production in ZR-75-1 cells.

Genome-wide association studies in human type 2 diabetes (T2D) have renewed interest in the pancreatic islet as a contributor to T2D risk. Chronic low-grade inflammation resulting from obesity is a risk factor for T2D and a possible trigger of β-cell failure. In this study, microarray data were collected from mouse islets after overnight treatment with cytokines at concentrations consistent with the chronic low-grade inflammation in T2D. Genes with a cytokine-induced change of >2-fold were then examined for associations between single nucleotide polymorphisms and the acute insulin response to glucose (AIRg) using data from the Genetics Underlying Diabetes in Hispanics (GUARDIAN) Consortium. Significant evidence of association was found between AIRg and single nucleotide polymorphisms in Arap3 (5q31.3), F13a1 (6p25.3), Klhl6 (3q27.1), Nid1 (1q42.3), Pamr1 (11p13), Ripk2 (8q21.3), and Steap4 (7q21.12). To assess the potential relevance to islet function, mouse islets were exposed to conditions modeling low-grade inflammation, mitochondrial stress, endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress, glucotoxicity, and lipotoxicity. RT-PCR revealed that one or more forms of stress significantly altered expression levels of all genes except Arap3. Thapsigargin-induced ER stress up-regulated both Pamr1 and Klhl6. Three genes confirmed microarray predictions of significant cytokine sensitivity: F13a1 was down-regulated 3.3-fold by cytokines, Ripk2 was up-regulated 1.5- to 3-fold by all stressors, and Steap4 was profoundly cytokine sensitive (167-fold up-regulation). Three genes were thus closely associated with low-grade inflammation in murine islets and also with a marker for islet function (AIRg) in a diabetes-prone human population. This islet-targeted genome-wide association scan identified several previously unrecognized candidate genes related to islet dysfunction during the development of T2D.

Calcium-activated chloride channel (CaCC) plays an important role in modulating epithelial secretion. It has been suggested that in salivary tissues, sustained fluid secretion is dependent on Ca(2+) influx that activates ion channels such as CaCC to initiate Cl(-) efflux. However direct evidence as well as the molecular identity of the Ca(2+) channel responsible for activating CaCC in salivary tissues is not yet identified. Here we provide evidence that in human salivary cells, an outward rectifying Cl(-) current was activated by increasing [Ca(2+)]i, which was inhibited by the addition of pharmacological agents niflumic acid (NFA), an antagonist of CaCC, or T16Ainh-A01, a specific TMEM16a inhibitor. Addition of thapsigargin (Tg), that induces store-depletion and activates TRPC1-mediated Ca(2+) entry, potentiated the Cl(-) current, which was inhibited by the addition of a non-specific TRPC channel blocker SKF96365 or removal of external Ca(2+). Stimulation with Tg also increased plasma membrane expression of TMEM16a protein, which was also dependent on Ca(2+) entry. Importantly, in salivary cells, TRPC1 silencing, but not that of TRPC3, inhibited CaCC especially upon store depletion. Moreover, primary acinar cells isolated from submandibular gland also showed outward rectifying Cl(-) currents upon increasing [Ca(2+)]i. These Cl(-) currents were again potentiated with the addition of Tg, but inhibited in the presence of T16Ainh-A01. Finally, acinar cells isolated from the submandibular glands of TRPC1 knockout mice showed significant inhibition of the outward Cl(-) currents without decreasing TMEM16a expression. Together the data suggests that Ca(2+) entry via the TRPC1 channels is essential for the activation of CaCC.

Tumor necrosis factor-related apoptosis-inducing ligand (TRAIL) is a member of the tumor necrosis factor superfamily, whose members are capable of inducing apoptosis and inflammation. Endoplasmic reticulum stress (ERS) plays a key role in immune surveillance in macrophages. TRAIL mRNA and protein expression have previously been detected in macrophages; however, whether ERS has any effects on TRAIL expression in macrophages has not yet been determined. Here, we demonstrate that thapsigargin (TG) and tunicamycin (TM), two ERS inducers activated macrophages were able to increase TRAIL mRNA and protein expression in RAW264.7 macrophages, the culture supernatant of THP-1 cells, and mouse peritoneal macrophages, indicating that ERS as a potent inducer of TRAIL transcription and expression in macrophages. This effect was blocked by the specific JNK inhibitor SP600125 and transcription factor AP-1 inhibitor SR 1130. Interestingly, at the molecular level, regulation of TRAIL expression by ERS was accompanied by a significant decrease in cytokine signaling suppressor 3 (SOCS3). SOCS3 siRNA clearly increased the expression of TRAIL mRNA and protein under ERS by activating the AP-1 components phosphorylated c-Jun and phosphorylated c-Fos in RAW264.7 cells. In contrast, over-expression of SOCS3 reversed ERS-induced TRAIL expression. These findings provide in vitro evidence that SOCS3 plays a critical negative role in the regulation of ERS-induced TRAIL expression via the Jun N-terminal kinase/AP-1 signaling pathway in macrophages.

Hydroxymethyl glutaryl-coenzyme A reductase degradation protein 1 (Hrd1) is an endoplasmic reticulum (ER)-transmembrane E3 ubiquitin ligase that has been studied in yeast, where it contributes to ER protein quality control by ER-associated degradation (ERAD) of misfolded proteins that accumulate during ER stress. Neither Hrd1 nor ERAD has been studied in the heart, or in cardiac myocytes, where protein quality control is critical for proper heart function. The objective of this study were to elucidate roles for Hrd1 in ER stress, ERAD, and viability in cultured cardiac myocytes and in the mouse heart, in vivo. The effects of small interfering RNA-mediated Hrd1 knockdown were examined in cultured neonatal rat ventricular myocytes. The effects of adeno-associated virus-mediated Hrd1 knockdown and overexpression were examined in the hearts of mice subjected to pressure overload-induced pathological cardiac hypertrophy, which challenges protein-folding capacity. In cardiac myocytes, the ER stressors, thapsigargin and tunicamycin increased ERAD, as well as adaptive ER stress proteins, and minimally affected cell death. However, when Hrd1 was knocked down, thapsigargin and tunicamycin dramatically decreased ERAD, while increasing maladaptive ER stress proteins and cell death. In vivo, Hrd1 knockdown exacerbated cardiac dysfunction and increased apoptosis and cardiac hypertrophy, whereas Hrd1 overexpression preserved cardiac function and decreased apoptosis and attenuated cardiac hypertrophy in the hearts of mice subjected to pressure overload. Hrd1 and ERAD are essential components of the adaptive ER stress response in cardiac myocytes. Hrd1 contributes to preserving heart structure and function in a mouse model of pathological cardiac hypertrophy.

The endoplasmic reticulum (ER), a complex membrane structure, has important roles in all eukaryotic cells. Catastrophe of its functions would lead to ER stress that causes various diseases such as cancer, neurodegenerative diseases, diabetes and so on. Prolonged ER stress could trigger apoptosis via activation of various signal transduction pathways. To investigate physiological roles of histone acetyltransferase GCN5 in regulation of ER stress, we analyzed responses of homozygous GCN5-deficient DT40 mutants, ΔGCN5, against ER stress. GCN5-deficiency in DT40 caused drastic resistance against apoptosis induced by pharmacological ER stress agents (thapsigargin and tunicamycin). Pharmaceutical analysis using specific Bcl-2 inhibitors showed that the drastic resistance against prolonged ER stress-induced apoptosis is, in part, due to up-regulation of Bcl-2 gene expression in ΔGCN5. These data revealed that GCN5 is involved in regulation of prolonged ER stress-induced apoptosis through controlling Bcl-2 gene expression.

The protective effects of 5'-AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) on the metabolic syndrome may include direct effects on resistance artery vasomotor function. However, the precise actions of AMPK on microvessels and their potential interaction are largely unknown. Thus, we set to determine the effects of AMPK activation on vascular smooth muscle tone and the underlying mechanisms. Resistance arteries isolated from hamster and mouse exhibited a pronounced endothelium-independent dilation on direct pharmacological AMPK activation by 2 structurally unrelated compounds (PT1 and A769662). The dilation was associated with a decrease of intracellular-free calcium [Ca(2+)]i in vascular smooth muscle cell. AMPK stimulation induced activation of BKCa channels as assessed by patch clamp studies in freshly isolated hamster vascular smooth muscle cell and confirmed by direct proof of membrane hyperpolarization in intact arteries. The BKCa channel blocker iberiotoxin abolished the hyperpolarization but only partially reduced the dilation and did not affect the decrease of [Ca(2+)]i. By contrast, the sarcoplasmic/endoplasmic Ca(2+)-ATPase (SERCA) inhibitor thapsigargin largely reduced these effects, whereas combined inhibition of SERCA and BKCa channels virtually abolished them. AMPK stimulation significantly increased the phosphorylation of the SERCA modulator phospholamban at the regulatory T17 site. Stimulation of smooth muscle AMPK represents a new, potent vasodilator mechanism in resistance vessels. AMPK directly relaxes vascular smooth muscle cell by a decrease of [Ca(2+)]i. This is achieved by calcium sequestration via SERCA activation, as well as activation of BKCa channels. There is in part a mutual compensation of both calcium-lowering mechanisms. However, SERCA activation which involves an AMPK-dependent phosphorylation of phospholamban is the predominant mechanism in resistance vessels.

Reactive oxygen species regulate cardiovascular and renal function in health and disease. Superoxide participates in acute calcium signaling in afferent arterioles and renal vasoconstriction produced by angiotensin II, endothelin, thromboxane, and pressure-induced myogenic tone. Known mechanisms by which superoxide acts include quenching of nitric oxide and increased ADP ribosyl cyclase/ryanodine-mediated calcium mobilization. The effect(s) of superoxide on other calcium signaling pathways in the renal microcirculation is poorly understood. The present experiments examined the acute effect of superoxide generated by paraquat on calcium entry pathways in isolated rat afferent arterioles. The peak increase in cytosolic calcium concentration caused by KCl (40 mmol/L) was 99±14 nmol/L. The response to this membrane depolarization was mediated exclusively by L-type channels because it was abolished by nifedipine but was unaffected by the T-type channel blocker mibefradil. Paraquat increased superoxide production (dihydroethidium fluorescence), tripled the peak response to KCl to 314±68 nmol/L (P<0.001) and doubled the plateau response. These effects were abolished by tempol and nitroblue tetrazolium, but not by catalase, confirming actions of superoxide and not of hydrogen peroxide. Unaffected by paraquat and superoxide was calcium entry through store-operated calcium channels activated by thapsigargin-induced calcium depletion of sarcoplasmic reticular stores. Also unresponsive to paraquat was ryanodine receptor-mediated calcium-induced calcium release from the sarcoplasmic reticulum. Our results provide new evidence that superoxide enhances calcium entry through L-type channels activated by membrane depolarization in rat cortical afferent arterioles, without affecting calcium entry through store-operated entry or ryanodine receptor-mediated calcium mobilization.

Autophagy is the process by which portions of cytoplasm are enclosed by membranous organelles, phagophores, which deliver the sequestered cytoplasm to degradative autophagic vacuoles. Genes and proteins involved in phagophore manufacture have been extensively studied, but little is known about how mature phagophores proceed through the subsequent steps of expansion, closure and fusion. Here we have addressed these issues by combining our unique autophagic cargo sequestration assay (using the cytosolic enzyme lactate dehydrogenase as a cargo marker) with quantitative measurements of the lipidation-dependent anchorage and turnover of the phagophore-associated protein LC3. In isolated rat hepatocytes, amino acid starved to induce maximal autophagic activity, the two unrelated reversible autophagy inhibitors 3-methyladenine (3MA) and thapsigargin (TG) both blocked cargo sequestration completely. However, whereas 3MA inhibited LC3 lipidation, TG did not, thus apparently acting at a post-lipidation step to prevent phagophore closure. Intriguingly, the resumption of cargo sequestration seen upon release from a reversible TG block was completely suppressed by 3MA, revealing that 3MA not only inhibits LC3 lipidation but also (like TG) blocks phagophore closure at a post-lipidation step. 3MA did not, however, prevent the resumption of lysosomal LC3 degradation, indicating that phagophores could fuse directly with degradative autophagic vacuoles without carrying cytosolic cargo. This fusion step was clearly blocked by TG. Furthermore, density gradient centrifugation revealed that a fraction of the LC3-marked phagophores retained by TG could be density-shifted by the acidotropic drug propylamine along with the lysosomal marker cathepsin B, suggesting physical association of some phagophores with lysosomes prior to cargo sequestration.

Abnormal intracellular calcium (Ca(2+)) handling can trigger endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress, leading to activation of the unfolded protein response (UPR) in an attempt to prevent cell death. Mechanical unloading with a left ventricular assist device (LVAD) relieves pressure-volume overload and promotes reverse remodeling of the failing myocardium. We hypothesized that mechanical unloading would alter the UPR in patients with advanced heart failure (HF). UPR was analyzed in paired myocardial tissue from 10 patients with dilated cardiomyopathy obtained during LVAD implantation and explantation. Samples from healthy hearts served as controls. Markers of UPR [binding immunoglobulin protein (BiP), phosphorylated (P-) eukaryotic initiation factor (eIF2α), and X-box binding protein (XBP1)] were significantly increased in HF, whereas LVAD support significantly decreased BiP, P-eIF2α, and XBP1s levels. Apoptosis as reflected by C/EBP homologous protein and DNA damage were also significantly reduced after LVAD support. Improvement in left ventricular dimensions positively correlated with P-eIF2α/eIF2α and apoptosis level recovery. Furthermore, significant dysregulation of calcium-handling proteins [P-ryanodine receptor, Ca(2+) storing protein calsequestrin, Na(+)-Ca(2+) exchanger, sarcoendoplasmic reticulum Ca(2+)-ATPase (SERCA2a), ER chaperone protein calreticulin] was normalized after LVAD support. Reduced ER Ca(2+) content as a causative mechanism for UPR was confirmed using AC16 cells treated with a calcium ionophore (A23187) and SERCA2a inhibitor (thapsigargin). UPR activation and apoptosis are reduced after mechanical unloading, which may be mediated by the improvement of Ca(2+) handling in patients with advanced HF. These changes may impact the potential for myocardial recovery.

Adipocytes play a critical role in energy balance. Growth of fat tissue is achieved via an increase in adipocyte mass and the formation of newly differentiated adipocytes from precursor cells. Understanding the cellular and molecular mechanisms of adipocyte differentiation is crucial for the study of obesity- and fat-related diseases. The present study was designed to study whether small heterodimer partner-interacting leucine zipper protein (SMILE), a novel co-repressor, could regulate differentiation of adipocyte in 3T3-L1 cells. Treatment of endoplasmic stress inducers, thapsigargin and tunicamycin, inhibited adipocyte differentiation, stimulated Smile mRNA expression, and repressed the expression of adiponectin (Adipoq) in 3T3-L1 pre-adipocyte. Overexpression of SMILE in 3T3-L1 cells decreased the expression of the mRNA encoding Adipoq, a major marker of adipocytes, significantly. Furthermore, knockdown of SMILE recovered the thapsigargin-mediated repression of Adipoq transcription. Co-immunoprecipitation experiments revealed that SMILE interacted physically with PPARγ in 3T3-L1 cells. In addition, chromatin immunoprecipitation experiments revealed that SMILE suppressed the binding affinity of PPARγ for the Adipoq promoter. We demonstrate that SMILE controls adipocyte differentiation by regulating the transactivity of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor γ (PPARγ). These findings demonstrate that SMILE represses adipocyte differentiation by regulating PPARγ transactivity; hence, SMILE is a potential regulator of PPARγ-related diseases.

Abnormal accumulation of undigested macromolecules, often disease-specific, is a major feature of lysosomal and neurodegenerative disease and is frequently attributed to defective autophagy. The mechanistic underpinnings of the autophagy defects are the subject of intense research, which is aided by genetic disease models. To gain an improved understanding of the pathways regulating defective autophagy specifically in juvenile neuronal ceroid lipofuscinosis (JNCL or Batten disease), a neurodegenerative disease of childhood, we developed and piloted a GFP-microtubule-associated protein 1 light chain 3 (GFP-LC3) screening assay to identify, in an unbiased fashion, genotype-sensitive small molecule autophagy modifiers, employing a JNCL neuronal cell model bearing the most common disease mutation in CLN3. Thapsigargin, a sarco/endoplasmic reticulum Ca(2+)-ATPase (SERCA) Ca(2+) pump inhibitor, reproducibly displayed significantly more activity in the mouse JNCL cells, an effect that was also observed in human-induced pluripotent stem cell-derived JNCL neural progenitor cells. The mechanism of thapsigargin sensitivity was Ca(2+)-mediated, and autophagosome accumulation in JNCL cells could be reversed by Ca(2+) chelation. Interrogation of intracellular Ca(2+) handling highlighted alterations in endoplasmic reticulum, mitochondrial, and lysosomal Ca(2+) pools and in store-operated Ca(2+) uptake in JNCL cells. These results further support an important role for the CLN3 protein in intracellular Ca(2+) handling and in autophagic pathway flux and establish a powerful new platform for therapeutic screening.
