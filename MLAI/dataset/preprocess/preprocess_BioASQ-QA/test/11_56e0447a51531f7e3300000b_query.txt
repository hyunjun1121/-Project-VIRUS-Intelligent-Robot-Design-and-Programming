Which are the smallest known subviral pathogens of plants?

[PMID: 10494833]
Viroids, subviral pathogens of plants, are composed of a single-stranded circular RNA of 246-399 nucleotides. Within the 27 viroids sequenced, avocado sunblotch, peach latent mosaic and chrysanthemum chlorotic mottle viroids (ASBVd, PLMVd and CChMVd, respectively) can form hammerhead structures in both of their polarity strands. These ribozymes mediate self-cleavage of the oligomeric RNAs generated in the replication through a rolling circle mechanism, whose two other steps are catalyzed by an RNA polymerase and an RNA ligase. ASBVd, and presumably PLMVd and CChMVd, replicate and accumulate in the chloroplast, whereas typical viroids replicate and accumulate in the nucleus. PLMVd and CChMVd do not adopt a rod-like or quasi rod-like secondary structure as typical viroids do but have a highly branched conformation. A pathogenicity determinant has been mapped in a defined region of the CChMVd molecule.

Viroids are small, circular, single-stranded RNA molecules that cause several infectious plant diseases. Viroids do not encode any pathogen-specific peptides but nonetheless, the subviral pathogens replicate autonomously and spread in the plant by recruiting host proteins via functional motifs encoded in their RNA genome. During the past couple of years, considerable progress has been made towards comprehending how viroids interact with their hosts. Here, we summarize recent findings on the structure-function relationships of viroids, their strategies and mechanisms of replication and trafficking, and the identification and characterization of interacting host proteins. We also describe the impact of the RNA silencing machinery of plants on viroid RNAs and how this has started to influence our models of viroid replication and pathogenicity.

Viroids, satellite RNAs, satellites viruses and the human hepatitis delta virus form the 'brotherhood' of the smallest known infectious RNA agents, known as the subviral RNAs. For most of these species, it is generally accepted that characteristics such as cell movement, replication, host specificity and pathogenicity are encoded in their RNA sequences and their resulting RNA structures. Although many sequences are indexed in publicly available databases, these sequence annotation databases do not provide the advanced searches and data manipulation capability for identifying and characterizing subviral RNA motifs. The Subviral RNA database is a web-based environment that facilitates the research and analysis of viroids, satellite RNAs, satellites viruses, the human hepatitis delta virus, and related RNA sequences. It integrates a large number of Subviral RNA sequences, their respective RNA motifs, analysis tools, related publication links and additional pertinent information (ex. links, conferences, announcements), allowing users to efficiently retrieve and analyze relevant information about these small RNA agents. With its design, the Subviral RNA Database could be considered as a fundamental building block for the study of these related RNAs.

Since the discovery of non-coding, small, highly structured, satellite RNAs (satRNAs) and viroids as subviral pathogens of plants , have been of great interest to molecular biologists as possible living fossils of pre-cellular evolution in an RNA world. Despite extensive studies performed in the last four decades, there is still mystery surrounding the origin and evolutionary relationship between these subviral pathogens. Recent technical advances revealed some commonly shared replication features between these two subviral pathogens. In this review, we discuss our current perception of replication and evolutionary origin of these petite RNA pathogens.

Replicating circular RNAs are independent plant pathogens known as viroids, or act to modulate the pathogenesis of plant and animal viruses as their satellite RNAs. The rate of discovery of these subviral pathogens was low over the past 40 years because the classical approaches are technical demanding and time-consuming. We previously described an approach for homology-independent discovery of replicating circular RNAs by analysing the total small RNA populations from samples of diseased tissues with a computational program known as progressive filtering of overlapping small RNAs (PFOR). However, PFOR written in PERL language is extremely slow and is unable to discover those subviral pathogens that do not trigger in vivo accumulation of extensively overlapping small RNAs. Moreover, PFOR is yet to identify a new viroid capable of initiating independent infection. Here we report the development of PFOR2 that adopted parallel programming in the C++ language and was 3 to 8 times faster than PFOR. A new computational program was further developed and incorporated into PFOR2 to allow the identification of circular RNAs by deep sequencing of long RNAs instead of small RNAs. PFOR2 analysis of the small RNA libraries from grapevine and apple plants led to the discovery of Grapevine latent viroid (GLVd) and Apple hammerhead viroid-like RNA (AHVd-like RNA), respectively. GLVd was proposed as a new species in the genus Apscaviroid, because it contained the typical structural elements found in this group of viroids and initiated independent infection in grapevine seedlings. AHVd-like RNA encoded a biologically active hammerhead ribozyme in both polarities, and was not specifically associated with any of the viruses found in apple plants. We propose that these computational algorithms have the potential to discover novel circular RNAs in plants, invertebrates and vertebrates regardless of whether they replicate and/or induce the in vivo accumulation of small RNAs.

A common challenge in pathogen discovery by deep sequencing approaches is to recognize viral or subviral pathogens in samples of diseased tissue that share no significant homology with a known pathogen. Here we report a homology-independent approach for discovering viroids, a distinct class of free circular RNA subviral pathogens that encode no protein and are known to infect plants only. Our approach involves analyzing the sequences of the total small RNAs of the infected plants obtained by deep sequencing with a unique computational algorithm, progressive filtering of overlapping small RNAs (PFOR). Viroid infection triggers production of viroid-derived overlapping siRNAs that cover the entire genome with high densities. PFOR retains viroid-specific siRNAs for genome assembly by progressively eliminating nonoverlapping small RNAs and those that overlap but cannot be assembled into a direct repeat RNA, which is synthesized from circular or multimeric repeated-sequence templates during viroid replication. We show that viroids from the two known families are readily identified and their full-length sequences assembled by PFOR from small RNAs sequenced from infected plants. PFOR analysis of a grapevine library further identified a viroid-like circular RNA 375 nt long that shared no significant sequence homology with known molecules and encoded active hammerhead ribozymes in RNAs of both plus and minus polarities, which presumably self-cleave to release monomer from multimeric replicative intermediates. A potential application of the homology-independent approach for viroid discovery in plant and animal species where RNA replication triggers the biogenesis of siRNAs is discussed.

Contrary to earlier beliefs, viruses are not the smallest causative agents of infectious diseases. Single-stranded RNAs as small as 246 nucleotides exist in certain higher plants and cause more than a dozen crop diseases. These RNAs have been termed viroids. Despite their extremely limited information content, viroids replicate autonomously in susceptible cells--that is, they do not require helper functions from simultaneously replicating conventional viruses. Viroids are covalently closed circular molecules with a characteristic rodlike secondary structure in which short helical regions are interrupted by internal and bulge loops. Viroids are not translated; they are replicated by a host enzyme (or enzymes) (probably RNA polymerase II) via oligomeric RNA intermediates by a rolling circle mechanism. Viroidlike satellite RNAs resemble viroids in size and molecular structure, but are found within the capsids of specific helper viruses on which they depend for their own replication. These RNAs are of great interest to molecular biology for at least two reasons: 1) they are the smallest and simplest replicating molecules known, and 2) they may represent living fossils of precellular evolution in a hypothetical RNA world.

Viroids are plant subviral pathogens whose genomes are constituted by a single-stranded and covalently closed small RNA molecule that does not encode for any protein. Despite this genomic simplicity, they are able of inducing devastating symptoms in susceptible plants. Most of the 29 described viroid species fold into a rodlike or quasi-rodlike structure, whereas a few of them fold as branched structures. The shape of these RNA structures is perhaps one of the most characteristic properties of viroids and sometimes is considered their only phenotype. Here we use RNA thermodynamic secondary structure prediction algorithms to compare the mutational robustness of all viroid species. After characterizing the statistical properties of the distribution of mutational effects on structure stability and the wideness of neutral neighborhood for each viroid species, we show an evolutionary trend toward increased structural robustness during viroid radiation, giving support to the adaptive value of robustness. Differences in robustness among the 2 viroid families can be explained by the larger fragility of branched structures compared with the rodlike ones. We also show that genomic redundancy can contribute to the robustness of these simple RNA genomes.

Research during the last 15 years has conclusively shown that viroids are not only fundamentally different from viruses at the molecular level, but that they are most likely not directly related to viruses in an evolutionary sense. Today, viroids are among the most thoroughly studied biological macromolecules. Their molecular structures have been elucidated to a large extent, but much needs to be learned regarding the correlation between molecular structure and biological function. The availability of the tools of recombinant DNA technology in viroid research promises rapid progress in these areas of inquiry.

During 1970 and 1971, I discovered that a devastating disease of potato plants is not caused by a virus, as had been assumed, but by a new type of subviral pathogen, the viroid. Viroids are so small--one fiftieth of the size of the smallest viruses--that many scientists initially doubted their existence. We now know that viroids cause many damaging diseases of crop plants. Fortunately, new methods that are based on the unique properties of viroids now promise effective control.
