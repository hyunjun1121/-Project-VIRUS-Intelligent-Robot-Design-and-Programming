Which conditions is caused by mutations in HFE?

[PMID: 19146986]
Hereditary hemochromatosis (HH) is a common autosomal recessive disorder characterized by systemic iron overload with consequent tissue damage. The vast majority of HH patients are homozygous for the C282Y mutation in HFE, a non-classical MHC class-I gene located in chromosome 6, whose role in the regulation of systemic iron metabolism is still not completely understood. Iron enhances the formation of reactive oxygen species, with increasing risk of DNA damage induced by oxidative stress, and consequently an increased susceptibility to chromosome instability. In the present work we examined spontaneous and diepoxybutane (DEB)-induced chromosome instability in PHA-stimulated lymphocyte cultures from 23 HH patients, all homozygous for the C282Y HFE mutation, in comparison to 29 normal controls. In addition, three patients with secondary forms of iron overload, not related to HFE, were studied as controls to test the role of iron overload on DEB-induced chromosome instability. Our results show a significantly higher frequency of spontaneous chromosome breaks in lymphocytes from the HH patients, when compared with lymphocytes from normal controls (p<0.0001). In addition, there is a significant correlation between the percentage of cells with spontaneous chromosomal breaks and the transferrin saturation (r=0.53, p=0.0041) or serum-ferritin levels (r=0.66, p=0.0001) in patients. Surprisingly, the frequency of DEB-induced chromosome breaks was significantly lower in lymphocytes from HH patients than in lymphocytes from both controls and patients with secondary forms of hemochromatosis (p=0.0029). No correlation was observed between the percentage of cells with DEB-induced chromosome breaks and the transferrin saturation or serum-ferritin values. These results suggest that lymphocytes from HH patients may have an increased capacity to respond to DEB-induced chromosome breakage, and that this capacity is somehow related to the presence of the C282Y HFE mutation.

Recent studies have shown that hereditary hemochromatosis (HH) is likely to be caused by homozygosity for a Cys282Tyr mutation in the HFE gene located 4.5 Mb telomeric to HLA-A. Population studies of this polymorphism are facilitated by the fact that the Cys282Tyr mutation creates a Rsal restriction site. We have studied the codon 282 (Cys/Tyr) polymorphism in different ethnic groups. In agreement with previous observations the Tyr allele appeared to be rare or absent in Asiatic (Indian, Chinese) populations. The highest allele frequency (7.5%) was found in Swedes. Saamis (2%) and Mordvinians (1.8%) had significantly lower frequencies of the Tyr allele. Comparisons with allele frequencies based on prevalence estimates of HH showed some disagreements with the RFLP data, particularly in Finns. The newly described HFE marker provides a new approach to the screening of HH as well as studies of the relationship between the HFE Tyr allele and different disorders including cancer.

Genetic iron overload, or hemochromatosis, can be caused by mutations in HFE, hemojuvelin, and hepcidin genes. Hepcidin, a negative regulator of intestinal iron absorption, is found to be inappropriately low in both patients and in animal models, indicating that proper control of basal hepcidin levels requires both hemojuvelin and HFE. In mice, repulsive guidance molecule c (Rgmc, the hemojuvelin mouse ortholog) and hepcidin levels are transcriptionally regulated during inflammation. Here, we report that basal Rgmc levels in Hfe-deficient mice are normal and that these mice retain the ability to suppress Rgmc expression after lipopolysaccharide (LPS) challenge. Thus, Rgmc regulation by LPS is Hfe-independent. The response of Rgmc to LPS involves signaling through toll-like receptor 4 (Tlr4), because Tlr4-deficient mice do not show altered Rgmc expression after LPS administration. We further show that tumor necrosis factor-alpha, but not interleukin-6, is sufficient to cause Rgmc down-regulation by LPS. These results contrast with previous data demonstrating that hepcidin levels are directly regulated by interleukin-6 but not by tumor necrosis factor-alpha. The regulation of iron-related genes by different cytokines may allow for time-dependent control of iron metabolism changes during inflammation and may be relevant to chronic inflammation, infections, and cancer settings, leading to the development of anemia of chronic disease.

The most common form of hemochromatosis is caused by mutations in the HFE gene. Rare forms of the disease are caused by mutations in other genes. We present a patient with hyperferritinemia and iron overload, and facial flushing. Magnetic resonance imaging was performed to measure hepatic iron overload, and a molecular study of the genes involved in iron metabolism was undertaken. The iron overload was similar to that observed in HFE hemochromatosis, and the patient was double heterozygous for two novel mutations, c.-20G>A and c.718A>G (p.K240E), in the HFE and ferroportin (FPN1 or SLC40A1) genes, respectively. Hyperferritinemia and facial flushing improved after phlebotomy. Two of the patient's children were also studied, and the daughter was heterozygous for the mutation in the SLC40A1 gene, although she did not have hyperferritinemia. The patient presented a mild iron overload phenotype probably because of the two novel mutations in the HFE and SLC40A1 genes.

To assess geographic differences in the frequencies of HFE C282Y and H63D genotypes in six racial/ethnic groups recruited in the Hemochromatosis and Iron Overload Screening (HEIRS) Study. HFE C282Y and H63D genotypes of 97,551 participants, ages > or = 25 years, who reported that they belonged to one of six racial/ethnic groups, were analyzed. HFE genotype frequencies were compared among the racial/ethnic groups and among the HEIRS Study field centers within each racial/ethnic group. The distribution of HFE C282Y and H63D genotypes differed among racial/ethnic groups (P<.0001) and among field centers in Hispanics, Asians, Whites, and Blacks (each P<.05). Genotype frequencies were similar among field centers in Native Americans and Pacific Islanders. Frequencies of C282Y and H63D genotypes were greatest in Whites. The lowest frequencies of C282Y genotypes were observed in Asians; Blacks had the lowest H63D genotype frequencies and the highest frequency of the wild-type genotype. Among racial/ethnic groups, Hispanics had the greatest variation in HFE genotypes across geographic regions. HFE C282Y and H63D genotype frequencies vary significantly between racial/ethnic groups and within some racial/ethnic groups across geographic regions.

The classification of hereditary abnormalities of iron metabolism was recently expanded and diversified. Genetic hemochromatosis now corresponds to six diseases, namely classical hemochromatosis HFE 1; juvenile hemochromatosis HFE 2 due to mutations in an unidentified gene on chromosome 1; hemochromatosis HFE 3 due to mutations in the transferrin receptor 2 (TfR2); hemochromatosis HFE 4 caused by a mutation in the H subunit of ferritin; and hemochromatosis HFE 6 whose gene is hepcidine (HAMP). Systemic iron overload is also associated with aceruloplasminemia, atransferrinemia and the "Gracile" syndrome caused by mutations in BCS1L. The genes responsible for neonatal and African forms of iron overload are unknown. Other genetic diseases are due to localized iron overload: Friedreich's ataxia results from the expansion of triple nucleotide repeats within the frataxin (FRDA) gene; two forms of X-linked sideroblastic anemia are due to mutations within the delta aminolevulinate synthetase (ALAS 2) or ABC-7 genes; Hallervorden-Spatz syndrome is caused by a pantothenate kinase 2 gene (PANK-2) defect; neuroferritinopathies; and hyperferritinemia--cataract syndrome due to a mutation within the L-ferritin gene. In addition to this wide range of genetic abnormalities, two other features characterize these iron disorders: 1) most are transmitted by an autosomal recessive mechanism, but some, including hemochromatosis type 4, have dominant transmission; and 2) most correspond to cytosolic iron accumulation while some, like Friedreich's ataxia, are disorders of mitochondrial metabolism.

The mechanisms by which the hereditary hemochromatosis protein, HFE, decreases transferrin-mediated iron uptake were examined. Coimmunoprecipitation studies using solubilized cell extracts demonstrated that transferrin (Tf) competed with HFE for binding to the transferrin receptor (TfR) similar to previous in vitro studies using soluble truncated forms of HFE and the TfR. At concentrations of Tf approaching those found in the blood, no differences in Tf binding to cells were detected, which is consistent with the lower binding constant of HFE for TfR versus Tf. However, cells expressing HFE still showed a decrease in Tf-mediated iron uptake at concentrations of Tf sufficient to dissociate HFE from the TfR. These results indicate that the association of HFE with TfR is not essential for its ability to lower intracellular iron stores. To test the effect of HFE on lowering intracellular iron levels independently of its association with TfR, a mutated HFE (fW81AHFE) that shows greatly reduced affinity for the TfR was transfected into tetracycline-controlled transactivator HeLa cells. HeLa cells expressing fW81AHFE behaved in a similar manner to cells expressing wild-type HFE with respect to decreased intracellular iron levels measured by iron regulatory protein gel-shift assays and ferritin levels. The results indicate that HFE can lower intracellular iron levels independently of its interaction with the TfR.

Elevated body iron stores are associated with morbidity and mortality due to oxidative stress. Hereditary hemochromatosis, a common condition caused by HFE gene mutations, can lead to excess iron storage and disease but clinical penetrance of HFE gene mutations is low and many people with elevated iron stores lack HFE mutations. We analyzed data from the Hemochromatosis and Iron Overload Screening Study to assess the relationship among HFE genotype (individuals with either homozygous or compound heterozygous status for C282Y and/or H63D HFE mutations were defined as genotype positive, or G+), elevated iron phenotype (individuals exceeding gender-specific transferrin saturation and serum ferritin threshold levels were considered phenotype positive, or P+), and leukocyte telomere length, a marker of biological aging and cumulative oxidative stress. In unadjusted analyses in comparison to individuals who were G-P-, G+P- were not significantly different (OR 0.74; 95% CI 0.26-2.04), while the G+P+ (OR 2.03; 95% CI 1.15-3.56), and G-P+ (OR 2.24; 95% CI 1.5-3.29) had increased risk of short telomeres (<=25th percentile) rather than long telomeres (>=75th percentile). In analyses adjusting for age, gender, and race/ethnicity, the effect of individuals with elevated iron phenotypes having short telomeres persisted with G+P+ individuals (OR 1.94; 95% CI 1.02-3.72), and G-P+ individuals (OR 2.17; 95% CI 1.39-3.39) being significantly different from the G-P- group. In conclusion, elevated iron phenotype, but not HFE genotype, was associated with shortened telomeres. Further studies will be needed to determine whether telomere length provides a marker for morbidities specifically associated with iron overload.

Hereditary hemochromatosis is an autosomal recessive and most commonly inherited single gene disorder among Caucasians, with a prevalence of 5 per 1,000 and a carrier frequency of 1 in 10. Two point mutations were described and are referred as C282Y and H63D. In the present study, we have analyzed 729 north Indian samples for C282Y and H63D mutations. Of these, no allele of the C282Y mutation was seen, while 3 homozygous and 43 heterozygous for the H63D mutation were seen in the patients of thalassemia group. However, 47 cases were found heterozygous for the H63D mutation among the normal groups (11.16%).

Comparative analysis of the hemochromatosis-associated mutations C282Y, H63D and S65C in the HFE gene in 51 patients using three different methods is reported. One PCR-RFLP method was based on general primers, whereas another employed mutation-specific mismatched primers. The third method was a new PCR-based reverse hybridisation line probe assay (LiPA), comprising DNA amplification by general primers followed by a single step reverse hybridization to specific probes, immobilized on a nitrocellulose strip. Forty-eight (94%) of the 51 samples yielded identical results by all three methods. Three discrepant results were obtained, caused by polymorphisms in the primer binding region, resulting in no amplification at all or selective amplification, leading to misinterpretation of the HFE genotype by PCR-RFLP. The design of the assay and the stringency of the reaction conditions used are crucial to obtain a correct HFE genotype. PCR-LiPA offers an easy and reliable alternative to currently used conventional methods.

Most types of genetic hemochromatosis are due to mutations in the HFE gene, although similar iron overload and organ damage can also result from mutations in genes other than HFE in rare types of hemochromatosis. Non-HFE hemochromatoses have been divided into two subgroups with distinctive features. The first includes juvenile and TFR2-related hemochromatoses that, similar to HFE hemochromatosis, show recessive inheritance, increased transferrin saturation, iron storage in hepatocytes and responsiveness to phlebotomy. Disorders in this subgroup, although differing regarding the severity of iron overload and/or the age at presentation, are all either due to hepcidin deficiency or to the inability to increase hepcidin levels according to iron stores. The second subgroup of hemochromatosis is caused by autosomal dominant mutations in the SLC40A1 gene encoding the iron exporter ferroportin with distinctive features. Iron loading of Kupffer cells and normal transferrin saturation characterize the so-called 'ferroportin disease'. In contrast, few mutations in SLC40A1 that cause hepcidin resistance lead to a hemochromatosis-like phenotype with dominant inheritance. The precise diagnosis of the genetic type of hemochromatosis is relevant for the follow-up, treatment, and for family counseling.

The etiology of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is unknown. The presence of mutations in the superoxide dismutase gene (SOD1) has led to theories regarding a role for oxidative stress in the pathogenesis of this disease. A primary cause of oxidative stress is perturbations in cellular iron homeostasis. Cellular iron mismanagement and oxidative stress are associated with a number of neurodegenerative diseases. One mechanism by which cells fail to properly regulate their iron status is through a mutation in the Hfe gene. Mutations in the Hfe gene are associated with the iron overload disease, hemochromatosis. In the current study, 31% of patients with sporadic ALS carried a mutation in the Hfe gene, compared to only 14% of patients without identifiable neuromuscular disease, or with neuromuscular diseases other than ALS (p<0.005). To determine the cellular consequences of carrying an Hfe mutation, a human neuronal cell line was transfected with genes carrying the Hfe mutation. The presence of the Hfe mutation disrupted expression of tubulin and actin at the protein levels potentially consistent with the disruption of axonal transport seen in ALS and was also associated with a decrease in CuZnSOD1 expression. These data provide compelling evidence for a role for the Hfe mutation in etiopathogenesis of ALS and warrant further investigation.

We report a family case of type II early-onset Alzheimer's disease (AD) inherited over three generations. None of the patients in the family had mutations in the genes believed to be the major risk factors for AD, such as APP, presenilin 1 or 2. Targeted exome sequencing of 249 genes that were previously reported to be associated with AD revealed a rare mutation in hemochromatosis (HFE) gene known to be associated with hemochromotosis. Compared to previous studies, we show that HFE mutation can possess the risk of AD in transferrin-, APOE- and APP-normal patients.

Hitherto studies on the ethiopathogenesis of porphyria cutanea tarda (PCT) show that the major pathogenic factor is iron ion, which acts via inhibition of the uroporphyrinogen decarboxylase. New speculations have appeared on the possible relation of this role of iron and the occurrence of mutation of the recently discovered gene of the hereditary hemochromatosis HFE, which may cause the iron overloading of the organism. Our paper describes prevalence of the C282Y gene mutation (HFE) together with the clinical and laboratory record in PCT patients. PCT was diagnosed mostly on the basis of clinical finding of actinic-traumatic vesicular dermatitis and the typical laboratory record of elevated higher-carboxylic porphyrines in urine and stool. Other laboratory methods tested the liver functions, plasma iron level and its binding capacity, ferritine level. All patient underwent routine haematological testing. Presence of antibodies against hepatitis C was also assayed (Elisa test 2nd generation, Sanofi Pasteur). In patients with prominent laboratory alterations showing possibility of the hepatic structural lesion, histology from the liver punctate was done. Frequency data of the C282Y gene mutation (HFE) in PCT patients was estimated on the basis of the genetic testing using PCR reaction of our own system. Group of PCT patients had 69 persons (63 patients with the sporadic form and 6 patients with familiar form of the disease). Hereditary haemochromatosis C282Y gene mutation (HH) was found in 15 patients, three of them were homozygotes and twelve heterozygotes (three heterozygotes had the familiar form of the disease). Nobody in this group was positive in the HIV antibody testing. In all porphyria patients with the presence of mutated gene who underwent liver biopsy, siderosis of different degrees was identified. In three patients neither the phenotypic observation nor the laboratory testing have shown haemochromatosis. Prevalence of C282Y gene mutation HFE in patients with porphyria cutanea tarda was studied. Such mutation was found in 15 persons (12 heterozygotes and 3 homozygotes) from the group of 69 tested patients (21.7%). Such frequency is significantly higher than in the control--nonporphyric--persons (10%). Patients were without clinical symptoms. Laboratory haematological changes, typical for HH, manifested in some of them only (elevated level of ferritine was found in 10 from 15 porphyria patients, elevated sideremia in one of them). Red blood cell counts were in both homo- and heterozygotes normal. Concurrence of the two porphyrinogenic factors--presence of gene mutation HFE and hepatitis C infection--was not proved. Antibodies against hepatitis C virus were not identified in any of the patients. Siderosis was found to be only a symptomatic sign, which was pronounced in different degree in all 9 porphyria patients with C282Y gene mutation who underwent liver biopsy. Frequency of C282Y gene mutation in our patients with porphyria cutanea tarda appears similar to that in other Middle European countries. It differs significantly from the frequency found in South European and North European countries (British).

Hemochromatosis is caused by mutations in HFE, a protein that competes with transferrin (TF) for binding to transferrin receptor 1 (TFR1). We developed mutant mouse strains to gain insight into the role of the Hfe/Tfr1 complex in regulating iron homeostasis. We introduced mutations into a ubiquitously expressed Tfr1 transgene or the endogenous Tfr1 locus to promote or prevent the Hfe/Tfr1 interaction. Under conditions favoring a constitutive Hfe/Tfr1 interaction, mice developed iron overload attributable to inappropriately low expression of the hormone hepcidin. In contrast, mice carrying a mutation that interferes with the Hfe/Tfr1 interaction developed iron deficiency associated with inappropriately high hepcidin expression. High-level expression of a liver-specific Hfe transgene in Hfe-/- mice was also associated with increased hepcidin production and iron deficiency. Together, these models suggest that Hfe induces hepcidin expression when it is not in complex with Tfr1.

The aim of the study was to investigate the molecular basis of hereditary haemochromatosis (HH) in South Africa in order to establish a reliable, cost-effective molecular diagnostic service for this potentially lethal disorder. DNA samples of patient and control groups were screened for two common haemochromatosis (HFE) gene mutations. The local frequencies of mutations C282Y and H63D were determined and the DNA results correlated with biochemical parameters. Patients were referred from private practitioners, health workers and pathologists for a molecular diagnosis of HH at the University of Stellenbosch Medical School. Twenty-two of the 244 referrals were clinically diagnosed with HH, while the remaining patients were family members of the probands or unrelated subjects referred solely on the basis of an abnormal iron profile. Seventeen of the 22 patient referrals (77%) diagnosed with HH were homozygous for the C282Y mutation, 3 (14%) were compound heterozygotes for mutations C282Y and H63D, and 2 patients (9%) did not exhibit either mutation. Screening of 458 control individuals from the general South African population demonstrated a carrier frequency of approximately 17% for the C282Y mutation among whites, implying that up to 1 out of every 115 South Africans of European descent may be homozygous for this founder-type mutation. Among 64 healthy blood donors of mixed ancestry, we detected 2 individuals heterozygous and 1 homozygous for the C282Y mutation. The detection of mutations C282Y and H63D at a high frequency in the majority of affected South African patients facilitates accurate pre-clinical and confirmatory diagnosis of HH in South Africa. Early detection by DNA screening and subsequent treatment by repeated phlebotomy can prevent disease onset in affected individuals. DNA diagnosis is particularly applicable to a common genetic disease such as HH, which is underdiagnosed and potentially lethal, but treatable.

Sporadic porphyria cutanea tarda (PCT) is caused by a reduced activity of uroporphyrinogen decarboxylase (URO-D) in the liver. Mild to moderate iron overload is common in PCT, as iron is one of the factors which trigger the clinical manifestations of the disease through the inactivation of URO-D. A role for genetic hemochromatosis in the development of iron overload in sporadic PCT has been hypothesized in the past. The aim of this work was to investigate whether mutations of HFE, which is a candidate gene for hemochromatosis, play the role of genetic susceptibility factors for PCT in Italian patients, who have a high prevalence of acquired triggering factors, such as hepatitis C virus (HCV) chronic infection and alcohol. We determined HFE genotypes of 68 male patients with PCT. Our data do not confirm an association of PCT with the Cys282Tyr HFE mutation, strongly associated with hemochromatosis in Northern European countries. A second mutation of HFE, His63Asp, however, had a significantly increased frequency as it was present in half of the patients. Surprisingly, the presence of the His63Asp mutation was not related to the iron status of patients, suggesting that a subtle abnormality of iron metabolism induced by this mutation could escape detection by the standard parameters of iron status. In PCT patients with liver disease, the presence of the mutation could contribute to the inactivation of URO-D, either directly or through a synergistic action with other factors that cause liver damage.

Hereditary hemochromatosis is caused by mutations in the hereditary hemochromatosis protein (HFE), transferrin-receptor 2 (TfR2), hemojuvelin, hepcidin, or ferroportin genes. Hepcidin is a key iron regulator, which is secreted by the liver, and decreases serum iron levels by causing the down-regulation of the iron transporter, ferroportin. Mutations in either HFE or TfR2 lower hepcidin levels, implying that both HFE and TfR2 are necessary for regulation of hepcidin expression. In this study, we used a recombinant adeno-associated virus, AAV2/8, for hepatocyte-specific expression of either Hfe or Tfr2 in mice. Expression of Hfe in Hfe-null mice both increased Hfe and hepcidin mRNA and lowered hepatic iron and Tf saturation. Expression of Tfr2 in Tfr2-deficient mice had a similar effect, whereas expression of Hfe in Tfr2-deficient mice or of Tfr2 in Hfe-null mice had no effect on liver or serum iron levels. Expression of Hfe in wild-type mice increased hepcidin mRNA and lowered iron levels. In contrast, expression of Tfr2 had no effect on wild-type mice. These findings suggest that Hfe is limiting in formation of the Hfe/Tfr2 complex that regulates hepcidin expression. In addition, these studies show that the use of recombinant AAV vector to deliver genes is a promising approach for studying physiologic consequences of protein complexes.

The three main mutations in gene HFE (C282Y, H63D, S65C) are the cause of development of 97% of cases of inherent hemochromatosis. It is known that about 85% of patients with inherent hemochromatosis are either homo-zygotic agents of mutation C282Y or carry compound-heterozygote C282Y/H63D. Therefore, the molecular genetic study intended for detection of these three mutations in gene HFE takes important place in diagnostic of inherent hemochromatosis. The study was organized to develop methods for detection of mutations C282Y, H63D, S65C on the basis of two molecular genetic methods - polymerase chain reaction in real-time and pyrosequenation. As reference method was used published method by Moyses C.B. et al. (2008). These methods were applied to analyzing 129 DNA samples. There were no discordant results. Among analyzed clinical DNA samples, mutant alleles of gene HFE were detected in 42 samples (32.5%)ю The mutation C282Y is detected in heterozygotic condition in 4 samples (3.1%); mutation H63D was detected in heterozygotic condition in 31 samples (24%) and in homo-zygotic condition in 4 samples (4%). The mutation S65C encountered in heterozygotic condition in one sample (0.8%) and in one sample compound-heterozygote H63D/S65C was detected (0.8%). The comparative characteristic of these three methods was made according the following parameters: time, number of analysis stages and convenience of interpretation of results. The main merit of method based on polymerase chain reaction in real-time is time of analysis implementation. The main merit of method based on pyrosequenation is automatic identification of genotype.

Hemochromatosis is a common disorder characterized by excess iron absorption and accumulation of iron in tissues. Usually hemochromatosis is inherited in an autosomal recessive pattern and is caused by mutations in the HFE gene. Less common non-HFE-related forms of hemochromatosis have been reported and are caused by mutations in the transferrin receptor 2 gene and in a gene localized to chromosome 1q. Autosomal dominant forms of hemochromatosis have also been described. Recently, 2 mutations in the ferroportin1 gene, which encodes the iron transport protein ferroportin1, have been implicated in families with autosomal dominant hemochromatosis from the Netherlands and Italy. We report the finding of a novel mutation (V162del) in ferroportin1 in an Australian family with autosomal dominant hemochromatosis. We propose that this mutation disrupts the function of the ferroportin1 protein, leading to impaired iron homeostasis and iron overload.

On admission to hospital Caucasian 61 year old male with jaundice was found to have unexplained increased serum iron indices. He had bilateral peripheral arthritis. On further investigation he had grade II hepatocellular iron staining and a hepatic index of 5.4 leading to a diagnosis of hereditary hemochromatosis. He lacked the common C282Y HFE mutation. We sequenced the complete HFE gene and found that he was heterozygous for a novel single nucleotide deletion (c.del478) in exon 3 of HFE. He lacks any other mutation in HFE or HJV, TFR2, HAMP and SLC40A1. The HFE mutation causes a frameshift (p.P160fs) that introduces a premature termination codon leading to mRNA degradation by nonsense-mediated decay. Haploinsufficiency of HFE may be one possible explanation for hemochromatosis in this patient.

Iron overload is associated with acquired and genetic conditions, the most common being hereditary hemochromatosis (HH) type-I, caused by HFE mutations. Here, we conducted a hospital-based case-control study of 41 patients from the São Miguel Island (Azores, Portugal), six belonging to a family with HH type-I pseudodominant inheritance, and 35 unrelated individuals fulfilling the biochemical criteria of iron overload compatible with HH type-I. For this purpose, we analyzed the most common HFE mutations- c.845G>A [p.Cys282Tyr], c.187C>G [p.His63Asp], and c.193A>T [p.Ser65Cys]. Results revealed that the family's HH pseudodominant pattern is due to consanguineous marriage of HFE-c.845G>A carriers, and to marriage with a genetically unrelated spouse that is a -c.187G carrier. Regarding unrelated patients, six were homozygous for c.845A, and three were c.845A/c.187G compound heterozygous. We then performed sequencing of HFE exons 2, 4, 5 and their intron-flanking regions. No other mutations were observed, but we identified the -c.340+4C [IVS2+4C] splice variant in 26 (74.3%) patients. Functionally, the c.340+4C may generate alternative splicing by HFE exon 2 skipping and consequently, a protein missing the α1-domain essential for HFE/ transferrin receptor-1 interactions. Finally, we investigated HFE mutations configuration with iron overload by determining haplotypes and genotypic profiles. Results evidenced that carriers of HFE-c.187G allele also carry -c.340+4C, suggesting in-cis configuration. This data is corroborated by the association analysis where carriers of the complex allele HFE-c.[187C>G;340+4T>C] have an increased iron overload risk (RR = 2.08, 95% CI = 1.40-2.94, p<0.001). Therefore, homozygous for this complex allele are at risk of having iron overload because they will produce two altered proteins--the p.63Asp [c.187G], and the protein lacking 88 amino acids encoded by exon 2. In summary, we provide evidence that the complex allele HFE-c.[187C>G;340+4T>C] has a role, as genetic predisposition factor, on iron overload in the São Miguel population. Independent replication studies in other populations are needed to confirm this association.

An abnormal accumulation and distribution of brain iron are common to different neurodegenerative disorders, including Parkinson's disease (PD), and alteration of genes involved in iron metabolism cause neurodegeneration with brain iron accumulation. HFE participates in the regulation of iron metabolism, its mutations are primary cause of hereditary hemochromatosis and appear to be more frequent in neurodegenerative disorders such as Alzheimer's disease and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis. However, conflicting results were obtained in previous studies aimed to verify if nucleotide variations in HFE gene act as risk modifiers for PD. We used denaturing HPLC for scanning DNA sequence variations in exon 2 and 4 of HFE gene in a cohort of 475 Italian PD patients. We identified the most common H63D, C282Y and S65C, and also other 4 rare mutation types (R66H, R224W, E277K, and T281M). The allele frequency of H63D and C282Y was not statistically different from that of 2 control groups with similar mean age or of a large cohort of the same geographical area. In addition we could not find statistical differences in the clinical phenotypes of patients carrying at least one mutated HFE allele from those with the normal allele. We conclude that in the Italian population, the most common HFE mutations, H63D and C282Y are not associated with the individual risk to develop PD, nor have specific influence on the clinical features of the disease.

Most cases of primary hypertriglyceridemia (HTG) are caused by the interaction of unknown polygenes and environmental factors. Elevated iron storage is associated with metabolic syndrome, diabetes, and obesity, and all of them are associated with HTG. The aim of the study was to analyze whether HFE mutations causing hereditary hemochromatosis (HH) are associated with primary HTG. Genetic predisposition to HH was analyzed in a case-control study. The study was conducted at University Hospital Lipid Clinic. We studied two groups: 1) the HTG group, composed of 208 patients; and 2) the control group, composed of 215 normolipemic subjects and 161 familial hypercholesterolemia patients. Two HFE mutations (C282Y and H63D) were analyzed. We measured HH genetic predisposition difference between groups. HH genetic predisposition was 5.9 and 4.4 times higher in the HTG group than in the normolipemic (P = 0.02) and FH (P = 0.05) subjects, respectively. There were 35 cases (16.8%) of iron overload in the primary HTG group, 14 (6.5%) and nine (5.6%) in the normolipidemic and FH groups, respectively. A higher HH genetic predisposition and a different prevalence of iron overload in subjects with HH genetic predisposition among groups contributed to this higher prevalence. None of the four cases with the HFE genotype associated with high risk of HH in the control groups presented iron overload; however, in eight of 11 subjects (72.7%) with primary HTG and HH genetic predisposition, the iron overload was present. Mutations in HFE gene, favoring iron overload and causing HH, could play an important role in the development of several phenotypes of primary HTG.

The mechanism of excessive iron storage in patients with hereditary hemochromatosis caused by mutations of the HFE gene seems to be a failure to up-regulate hepcidin in the face of increased body iron. Since the cytokines IL-1 and IL-6 stimulate hepcidin transcription in the absence of HFE, chronic inflammatory states might counteract the effect of HFE mutations. We measured the pre-phlebotomy plasma levels of C reactive protein (CRP) and of interleukin 6 (IL-6) in homozygotes for the C282Y mutation of HFE. There was no difference in these levels in subjects with high iron stores than in those with low iron stores, suggesting that the phenotypic differences between such homozygotes is not appreciably affected by ongoing chronic inflammation.

Hereditary hemochromatosis (HH) is common among Caucasians; reported disease frequencies vary from 0.3 to 0.8%. Identification of a candidate HFE gene in 1996 was soon followed by the description of two ancestral mutations, i.e., c.845G-->A (C282Y) and c.187C-->G (H63D). To these was recently added the mutation S65C, which may represent a simple polymorphism. The incidence of HH in Greece is unknown but clinical cases are rare. Also unknown is the carrier frequency of the two mutant alleles. A first estimate of the latter is given in the present report. It is based on data from the genetic analysis of 10 unrelated patients of Greek origin who were referred to our center for genotyping and 158 unselected male blood donors. The allele frequencies for the C282Y and H63D mutations were 0.003 and 0.145, respectively. The C282Y allele was detected in 50% of HH patients. This is considerably lower than the frequencies reported for HH patients in the U.S.A. (82%) and France (91 %) and closer to that reported in Italy (64%). Five patients did not carry any known HFE mutation; three may represent cases of juvenile hemochromatosis, given their early onset with iron overload, hypogonadism, and heart disease. We suggest that genetic heterogeneity is more prominent in Southern Europe. It is also possible that the penetrance of the responsible genes is different across the Mediterranean.

Hereditary Hemochromatosis (HH) is a genetically heterogeneous disorder caused by mutations in at least five different genes (HFE, HJV, TFR2, SLC40A1, HAMP) involved in the production or activity of the liver hormone hepcidin, a key regulator of systemic iron homeostasis. Nevertheless, patients with an HH-like phenotype that remains completely/partially unexplained despite extensive sequencing of known genes are not infrequently seen at referral centers, suggesting a role of still unknown genetic factors. A compelling candidate is Bone Morphogenetic Protein 6 (BMP6), which acts as a major activator of the BMP-SMAD signaling pathway, ultimately leading to the upregulation of hepcidin gene transcription. A recent seminal study by French authors has described three heterozygous missense mutations in BMP6 associated with mild to moderate late-onset iron overload (IO). Using an updated next-generation sequencing (NGS)-based genetic test in IO patients negative for the classical HFE p.Cys282Tyr mutation, we found three BMP6 heterozygous missense mutations in four patients from three different families. One mutation (p.Leu96Pro) has already been described and proven to be functional. The other two (p.Glu112Gln, p.Arg257His) were novel, and both were located in the pro-peptide domain known to be crucial for appropriate BMP6 processing and secretion. In silico modeling also showed results consistent with their pathogenetic role. The patients' clinical phenotypes were similar to that of other patients with BMP6-related IO recently described. Our results independently add further evidence to the role of BMP6 mutations as likely contributing factors to late-onset moderate IO unrelated to mutations in the established five HH genes.

Iron is a potent generator of oxidative damage whose levels increase with age, potentially exacerbating age-related diseases. Several lines of evidence suggest that iron accumulation may be a factor in age-related macular degeneration (AMD). AMD retinas have more iron within the photoreceptors, RPE, and drusen than do age-matched control retinas. Accelerated AMD-like maculopathy develops in patients with retinal iron overload from the hereditary disease aceruloplasminemia. Mice with retinal iron overload resulting from knockout of ceruloplasmin and its homologue hephaestin exhibit retinal degeneration with some features of AMD, including subretinal neovascularization, accumulation of RPE lipofuscin and sub-RPE deposits, and RPE/photoreceptor death. Increased understanding of the mechanisms of retinal iron homeostasis may help in the development of therapies to prevent iron overload. For example, herein it is shown that one regulator of systemic iron homeostasis, HFE, is expressed in the RPE. Thus, patients with the common disease hereditary hemochromatosis, which is often caused by an HFE mutation, may have retinal iron overload predisposing to AMD. Preliminary data suggest that iron chelation can reduce RPE iron overload in mice and protect them from degeneration, suggesting that iron-binding drugs may one day prove useful in reducing RPE oxidative stress and decreasing the risk of AMD progression.

The hereditary hemochromatosis protein HFE promotes the expression of hepcidin, a circulating hormone produced by the liver that inhibits dietary iron absorption and macrophage iron release. HFE mutations are associated with impaired hepatic bone morphogenetic protein (BMP)/SMAD signaling for hepcidin production. TMPRSS6, a transmembrane serine protease mutated in iron-refractory iron deficiency anemia, inhibits hepcidin expression by dampening BMP/SMAD signaling. In the present study, we used genetic approaches in mice to examine the relationship between Hfe and Tmprss6 in the regulation of systemic iron homeostasis. Heterozygous loss of Tmprss6 in Hfe(-/-) mice reduced systemic iron overload, whereas homozygous loss caused systemic iron deficiency and elevated hepatic expression of hepcidin and other Bmp/Smad target genes. In contrast, neither genetic loss of Hfe nor hepatic Hfe overexpression modulated the hepcidin elevation and systemic iron deficiency of Tmprss6(-/-) mice. These results indicate that genetic loss of Tmprss6 increases Bmp/Smad signaling in an Hfe-independent manner that can restore Bmp/Smad signaling in Hfe(-/-) mice. Furthermore, these results suggest that natural genetic variation in the human ortholog TMPRSS6 might modify the clinical penetrance of HFE-associated hereditary hemochromatosis, raising the possibility that pharmacologic inhibition of TMPRSS6 could attenuate iron loading in this disorder.

Iron participates in oxygen transport, energetic, metabolic, and immunologic processes. There are 2 main causes of iron overload: hereditary hemochromatosis which is a primary cause, is a metabolic disorder caused by mutations of genes that control iron metabolism and secondary hemochromatosis caused by multitransfusions, chronic hemolysis, and intake of iron rich food. The most common type of hereditary hemochromatosis is caused by HFE gene mutation. In this study, we analyzed iron metabolism in 100 healthy Polish children in relation to their HFE gene status. The wild-type HFE gene was predominant being observed in 60 children (60%). Twenty-five children (25%), presented with heterozygotic H63D mutation, and 15 children (15%), presented with other mutations (heterozygotic C282Y and S65C mutation, compound heterozygotes C282Y/S65C, C282Y/H63D, H63D homozygote). The mean concentration of iron, the level of ferritin, and transferrin saturation were statistically higher in the group of HFE variants compared with the wild-type group. H63D carriers presented with higher mean concentration of iron, ferritin levels, and transferrin saturation compared with the wild-type group. Male HFE carriers presented with higher iron concentration, transferrin saturation, and ferritin levels than females. This preliminary investigation demonstrates allelic impact on potential disease progression from childhood.

Mutations in HFE are the most common cause of hereditary hemochromatosis (HH). HFE mutations result in reduced expression of hepcidin, a hepatic hormone, which negatively regulates iron absorption from the duodenum and iron release from macrophages. However, the mechanism by which HFE regulates hepcidin expression in hepatocytes is not well understood. It is known that the bone morphogenetic protein (BMP) pathway plays a central role in controlling hepcidin expression in the liver. Here we show that HFE overexpression increased Smad1/5/8 phosphorylation and hepcidin expression, whereas inhibition of BMP signaling abolished HFE-induced hepcidin expression in Hep3B cells. HFE was found to associate with ALK3, inhibiting ALK3 ubiquitination and proteasomal degradation and increasing ALK3 protein expression and accumulation on the cell surface. The 2 HFE mutants associated with HH, HFE C282Y and HFE H63D, regulated ALK3 protein ubiquitination and trafficking differently, but both failed to increase ALK3 cell-surface expression. Deletion of Hfe in mice resulted in a decrease in hepatic ALK3 protein expression. Our results provide evidence that HFE induces hepcidin expression via the BMP pathway: HFE interacts with ALK3 to stabilize ALK3 protein and increase ALK3 expression at the cell surface.
