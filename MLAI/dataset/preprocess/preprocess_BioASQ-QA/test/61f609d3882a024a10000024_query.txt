Bimekizumab is used for treatment of which disease?

[PMID: 34623614]
Psoriasis is a chronic, systemic, immune-mediated disease, with prominent skin and joint manifestations, associated with several comorbidities. In the past few decades, advances in the knowledge of psoriasis pathogenesis have driven the development of highly effective targeted biologic therapies, transforming the treatment landscape of psoriasis. Bimekizumab is a humanized antibody that selectively binds and neutralizes the biologic functions of interleukin (IL)-17A and IL-17F. This article reviews the current knowledge about bimekizumab in psoriasis treatment. The results obtained in the phase 3 studies (BE VIVID, BE READY, BE RADIANT, BE SURE) corroborate the high levels of efficacy of bimekizumab seen in previous studies, and show superior efficacy over adalimumab, ustekinumab, and secukinumab in direct comparative studies. In all phase 3 trials, bimekizumab was also well tolerated, with a safety profile similar to the other biologic drugs tested, except for a higher frequency of oral candidiasis. Dual inhibition of IL-17A and IL-17F is a highly effective therapeutic option for the treatment of psoriasis, both for naïve patients and for those resistant to previous biologic treatments.

Psoriatic arthritis is a complex and heterogeneous disease with potential significant disability and impaired quality of life. Although in the last decades new treatment options have led to a better management of this disease, there are still significant unmet therapeutic needs. Dual inhibitor antibodies target two different cytokines simultaneously, potentially offering a better disease control. In psoriatic arthritis, there is evidence for a pathogenic role not only of IL-17A but also the structurally homologous IL-17F. It is postulated that differential expression of both in several targets of PsA could account for disparities in clinical response to IL-17A inhibition alone (such as with secukinumab or ixekizumab). Here we review the evidence so far for the use in psoriatic arthritis of bimekizumab, the first humanized monoclonal IgG1 antibody that selectively neutralizes both IL-17A and IL-17F. A Phase 2b trial reports better outcomes over both placebo and IL-17A inhibition alone. Very recently encouraging results from open-label extensions with regards to both safety and maintenance of response were presented. Phase III trials are ongoing with the first results awaited in 2021.

Plaque psoriasis can significantly impact patients' quality of life. We assessed psychometric properties of the Psoriasis Symptoms and Impacts Measure (P-SIM), developed to capture patients' experiences of signs, symptoms and impacts of psoriasis. Pooled, blinded, 16-week data from 1002 patients in the BE VIVID and BE READY bimekizumab phase 3 trials were analysed. The suitability of the P-SIM missing score rule (weekly scores considered missing if ≥ 4 daily scores were missing) was assessed. Test-retest reliability was evaluated using intraclass correlation coefficients (ICCs). Convergent validity was assessed between P-SIM and relevant patient-reported outcome (PRO) (Dermatology Life Quality Index [DLQI], DLQI item 1 [skin symptoms], Patient Global Assessment of Psoriasis) and clinician-reported outcome (ClinRO) scores (Psoriasis Area and Severity Index [PASI], Investigator's Global Assessment [IGA]) at baseline and week 16. Known-groups validity was assessed, comparing P-SIM scores between patient subgroups predefined using PASI/IGA scores. Sensitivity to change over 16 weeks was evaluated; responder definition (RD) thresholds were explored. The missing score rule used did not impact P-SIM scores. Test-retest reliability analyses demonstrated excellent score reproducibility (ICC 0.91-0.98). Inter-item correlations at baseline and week 16 were strong (> 0.5), apart from "choice of clothing" with "skin pain" and "burning" at baseline (both 0.49). All P-SIM scores were moderately to strongly correlated with other outcomes, demonstrating convergent validity, apart from ClinROs (PASI, IGA) at baseline that had low variability. P-SIM scores discriminated known groups at week 16, confirming known-groups validity. Changes from baseline to week 16 in P-SIM and other clinically relevant outcomes were strongly correlated (> 0.5; weaker with ClinROs), establishing sensitivity to change. Anchor-based RD analyses determined a four-point P-SIM item score decrease as indicative of marked clinically meaningful improvement. P-SIM scores demonstrated good reliability, validity and sensitivity to change. A four-point RD threshold could be used to assess 16-week treatment effects.

To assess safety, pharmacokinetics (PK) and clinical efficacy of bimekizumab (formerly UCB4940), a novel humanized monoclonal antibody and dual inhibitor of interleukin (IL)-17A and IL-17F, in subjects with mild plaque psoriasis. Randomized, double-blind, first-in-human study of bimekizumab in 39 subjects who received single-dose intravenous bimekizumab (8-640 mg) or placebo (NCT02529956). Bimekizumab demonstrated dose-proportional linear PK and was tolerated across the dose range assessed. No subject discontinued due to treatment-emergent adverse events and no severe adverse events were reported. Bimekizumab demonstrated fast onset of clinically-meaningful effects on skin of patients with mild psoriasis as early as Week 2. Maximal improvements (100% or near 100% reductions from baseline) in all measures of disease activity were observed between Weeks 8-12 in subjects receiving 160-640 mg bimekizumab. The duration of effect at doses ≥160 mg was evident up to Weeks 12-20 after a single intravenous dose, dependent on endpoint. This is the first study to demonstrate the safety, tolerability and clinical efficacy of a dual IL-17A and IL-17F inhibitor, in subjects with mild psoriasis. Bimekizumab showed fast onset of clinically-meaningful efficacy by Week 2, with a maximal or near-maximal magnitude of response that was maintained up to study Weeks 12-20. These findings support the continued clinical development of bimekizumab for diseases mediated by both IL-17A and IL-17F, including psoriasis.

This analysis assessed the psychometric properties of the Psoriasis Symptoms and Impacts Measure (P-SIM), a novel patient-reported outcome (PRO) tool designed to capture patient experiences of the signs, symptoms and impacts of psoriasis. Blinded data from the BE RADIANT phase 3b trial of bimekizumab were analysed. In BE RADIANT, patients were randomised 1:1 to bimekizumab 320 mg every 4 weeks (Q4W) or secukinumab 300 mg (weekly until Week 4, then Q4W). Three items (itching, skin pain and scaling) of the P-SIM were electronically assessed throughout the trial and were scored from 0 to 10 (none to very severe signs/symptoms/impacts). Test-retest reliability was determined using intraclass correlations. Convergent validity was assessed between P-SIM and other relevant PRO and clinician-reported outcome (ClinRO) scores. Known-groups validity was assessed by comparing mean P-SIM item scores between patient subgroups based on the Psoriasis Area and Severity Index (PASI)/Investigator's Global Assessment (IGA) scores. Responsiveness was assessed via correlations between changes from baseline in P-SIM item scores and other relevant PRO and ClinRO scores. Anchor-based responder analyses and empirical cumulative distribution function (eCDF) curves determined responder thresholds. The three P-SIM items yielded high intraclass coefficients (> 0.70). By Week 48, the three P-SIM items had moderate (> 0.30 and ≤ 0.50) to strong (> 0.50) correlations with other PROs and weaker correlations with ClinROs, demonstrating good convergent validity. For almost all known-group comparisons, statistically significant between-subgroup score differences were seen across all three P-SIM items. Changes from baseline in the P-SIM and other relevant outcomes were above the acceptable threshold of ≤ 0.30, demonstrating sensitivity to change. Anchor-based analyses determined a ≥ four-point reduction from baseline to indicate marked clinically meaningful improvement for the P-SIM. These results support the validity, reliability and sensitivity to change of the P-SIM in assessing key symptoms (itching, skin pain and scaling) in patients with moderate to severe plaque psoriasis.

Plaque psoriasis (PsO) is a chronic inflammatory skin disorder that may be associated with several comorbidities, including arthritis. The increasing knowledge of psoriasis pathogenesis led to the identification of novel targeted therapeutic interventions. Among them, anti-IL-17A and anti-IL-17F antibodies are currently being investigated for the treatment of PsO and/or psoriatic arthritis (PsA). Bimekizumab is one of these agents, capable ofsimultaneously neutralizing both IL-17A and IL-17F cytokines. In this review we included preclinical and clinical data related to this highly promising agent that shows a peculiar molecular structure differing from other bispecific agents.

Bimekizumab is a monoclonal antibody that selectively inhibits both interleukin (IL)-17A and IL-17F, which is currently under investigation for treatment of moderate-to-severe plaque psoriasis. Maintenance dosing every 4 weeks is well established with IL-17 inhibitors for psoriasis. To investigate the possible dosing interval during bimekizumab maintenance therapy to maintain clear skin, to inform phase III studies. Forty-nine patients with moderate-to-severe plaque psoriasis received bimekizumab 320 mg at weeks 0/4, followed at week 16 by bimekizumab 320 mg (n = 17) or placebo (n = 32). Efficacy, safety, pharmacokinetics, immunogenicity and biopsy transcriptomic analyses were assessed to week 28. At week 8, 47% of patients achieved a 100% improvement from baseline in Psoriasis Area and Severity Index (PASI 100), increasing to 57% at week 12 (8 weeks after the second dose) before decreasing. In those who received bimekizumab at week 16, PASI 100 rate increased to comparable peak levels at week 20, but reduced by week 28 to 41% (12 weeks after the third dose). The week 8 transcriptional signature observed in lesional psoriatic skin rapidly normalized to levels consistent with nonlesional skin, resulting in molecular remission. Keratinocyte-related gene products such as CXCL1 (C-X-C motif chemokine ligand 1), IL-8 (encoded by the CXCL8 gene), CCL20 (C-C motif chemokine 20), IL-36γ and IL-17C were profoundly normalized to levels associated with nonlesional skin. Here, inhibition of IL-17F in addition to IL-17A resulted in rapid, deep clinical responses. Additionally, profound normalization of keratinocyte biology and the psoriatic transcriptome was observed, including normalization of both IL17 and IL23 gene expression by week 8. These data provide evidence to support evaluation of bimekizumab maintenance dosing both every 8 and every 4 weeks in phase III clinical trials.

Psoriasis is an immune-mediated inflammatory skin disease that affects about 2% of the population and is associated with many comorbidities. Recent advances have demonstrated interleukin (IL)-17 signaling plays a crucial role in the pathogenesis of psoriasis. Bimekizumab is a novel monoclonal antibody treatment for psoriasis that uses a single binding site to inhibit IL-17A and IL-17F. Here we will discuss the safety and efficacy of bimekizumab in the treatment of moderate-to-severe plaque psoriasis.

Psoriasis and psoriatic arthritis are common diseases with significant physical and emotional burden. Several biologics are FDA-approved to treat psoriasis and psoriatic arthritis, though some patients remain refractory to, or have lost response to, therapy and/or cannot tolerate the associated risks and side effects. Bimekizumab is a new biologic that inhibits both IL-17A and IL-17F. It is currently in phase III clinical trials. To date, phase II studies show promise in its ability to rapidly resolve symptoms while remaining safe and well-tolerated. Areas covered: This review serves to summarize the literature regarding the use of bimekizumab for psoriasis and psoriatic arthritis. Bimekizumab has undergone phase I and phase II clinical trials with results showing significant disease improvement or resolution, as well as safety and tolerability. Phase III studies are now actively enrolling. Expert opinion: Bimekizumab is a burgeoning biologic offering significant promise through its unique bispecific targeting of both IL-17A and IL-17F. Clinical trials have shown the potential of rapid symptom improvement after treatment with bimekizumab, with some patients seeing improvement after only two weeks. To date, bimekizumab has been shown to be safe and well-tolerated by patients, without any associated significant adverse events.

There is an unmet need for a treatment for psoriasis that results in complete skin clearance with a reliably quick response. Bimekizumab is a monoclonal IgG1 antibody that selectively inhibits interleukin (IL)-17F in addition to IL-17A. We aimed to compare the efficacy and safety of bimekizumab with placebo and ustekinumab in patients with moderate to severe plaque psoriasis over 52 weeks. BE VIVID was a multicentre, randomised, double-blind, active comparator and placebo controlled phase 3 trial done across 105 sites (clinics, hospitals, research units, and private practices) in 11 countries in Asia, Australia, Europe, and North America. Adults aged 18 years or older with moderate to severe plaque psoriasis (Psoriasis Area and Severity Index [PASI] score ≥12, ≥10% body surface area affected by psoriasis, and Investigator's Global Assessment [IGA] score ≥3 on a five point scale) were included. Randomisation was stratified by geographical region and previous exposure to biologics; patients, investigators, and sponsors were masked to treatment assignment. Patients were randomly assigned (4:2:1) using an interactive response technology to bimekizumab 320 mg every 4 weeks, ustekinumab 45 mg or 90 mg (baseline weight-dependent dosing) at weeks 0 and 4, then every 12 weeks, or placebo every 4 weeks. At week 16, patients receiving placebo switched to bimekizumab 320 mg every 4 weeks. All study treatments were administered as two subcutaneous injections. Coprimary endpoints were the proportion of patients with 90% improvement in the PASI (PASI90) and the proportion of patients with an IGA response of clear or almost clear (score 0 or 1) at week 16 (non-responder imputation). Efficacy analyses included the intention-to-treat population; safety analysis included patients who received at least one dose of study treatment. This trial was registered at ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT03370133 (completed). Between Dec 6, 2017, and Dec 13, 2019, 735 patients were screened and 567 were enrolled and randomly assigned (bimekizumab 320 mg every 4 weeks n=321, ustekinumab 45 mg or 90 mg every 12 weeks n=163, placebo n=83). At week 16, 273 (85%) of 321 patients in the bimekizumab group had PASI90 versus 81 (50%) of 163 in the ustekinumab group (risk difference 35 [95% CI 27-43]; p<0·0001) and four (5%) of 83 in the placebo group (risk difference 80 [74-86]; p<0·0001). At week 16, 270 (84%) patients in the bimekizumab group had an IGA response versus 87 (53%) in the ustekinumab group (risk difference 30 [95% CI 22-39]; p<0·0001) and four (5%) in the placebo group (risk difference 79 [73-85]; p<0·0001). Over 52 weeks, serious treatment-emergent adverse events were reported in 24 (6%) of 395 patients in the bimekizumab group (including those who switched from placebo at week 16) and 13 (8%) of 163 in the ustekinumab group. Bimekizumab was more efficacious than ustekinumab and placebo in the treatment of moderate to severe plaque psoriasis. The bimekizumab safety profile was consistent with that observed in previous studies. UCB Pharma.

Psoriasis and psoriatic arthritis are chronic immune-mediated disorders with involvement of interleukin (IL)-17 cytokines in their pathogenesis. IL-17A has been considered to be the most biologically active, but IL-17F is also over-expressed in skin and synovial tissues of patients with these diseases. Many therapeutic advances have been made in the past years, but some needs remain unmet. Dual inhibitor and bispecific antibodies simultaneously targeting IL-17A and IL-17F could provide better disease control. Herein we review current evidence on bimekizumab and sonelokimab. The antigen-binding site of bimekizumab neutralizes both IL-17A and IL-17F; phase I, II, and III studies have demonstrated its efficacy and safety in psoriasis and psoriatic arthritis. Sonelokimab is a trivalent nanobody targeting IL-17A and IL-17F; phase I and II studies with this molecule have yielded promising results in psoriasis.

Bimekizumab, a humanized monoclonal IgG1 antibody being currently evaluated for multiple immune-mediated diseases, is mentioned in the recent report by Clarivate, <i>Drugs to Watch in 2021</i>, as one of the drugs to be observed in 2021. Due to its novel mechanism of action (dual inhibition of IL-17A and IL-17F), bimekizumab is considered a new therapeutic approach for the treatment of moderate-to-severe psoriasis. Bimekizumab has demonstrated superiority in all direct comparative clinical trials conducted, whether against ustekinumab (IL-12/23 inhibitor), adalimumab (TNF inhibitor) or secukinumab (IL-17A inhibitor), and has shown very encouraging results for the treatment of psoriatic arthritis. Since September 2020, the drug is being reviewed by the EMA and FDA for the treatment of psoriasis. Herein, the current status of bimekizumab is discussed.

Interleukin 17A (IL-17A) is a pro-inflammatory cytokine produced by helper T cells (Th17) and other cells of the immune system and exerts pleiotropic effects on multiple cell lines. The role of IL-17 in the pathogenesis of numerous inflammatory disorders is well-documented. IL-17 activates signaling through the IL-17 receptor, which induces other proinflammatory cytokines, antimicrobial peptides, and neutrophil chemokines that are important for antifungal activity. Healthy levels of IL-17 can protect the host against extracellular bacterial and fungal infections in mucous membranes and epithelia. IL-17 deficiency reduces control of certain infections, while excessive IL-17 can produce unwanted inflammatory effects. Although the efficacy of the therapeutic blockade of this cytokine has been proven in several autoimmune diseases such as psoriasis and psoriatic arthritis, this strategy could also exacerbate fungal infections in such patients. Therefore, a better understanding of IL-17-mediated immunity to Candida is necessary for the development of autoimmune therapeutics that maintain antifungal immunity. In this review, we include a study of the new anti-IL-17 biological agents (secukinumab, ixekizumab, and bromalizumab) used for moderate-to-severe psoriasis and psoriatic arthritis treatment in clinical practice, as well as pivotal trials with bimekizumab. We study the relationship of these biological agents and the appearance of candidiasis in its various clinical forms.

Psoriasis is a chronic inflammatory skin disease with significant psychological and physical impact. Over the last few decades, several highly effective target therapies have been developed, leading to a major paradigm shift in the way psoriatic disease is managed. Despite this, a proportion of patients still do not respond or lose response over time. Bispecific antibodies target two different cytokines simultaneously, potentially offering a better disease control. Interleukin (IL)-17A and IL-17F share structural homology and have similar biologic function. IL-17A is classically considered to be the most biologically active, but recent studies have shown that IL-17F is also increased in psoriatic skin and synovial cell in psoriatic arthritis, supporting the rationale for targeting both IL-17A and IL-17F in psoriatic disease. Bimekizumab is the first-in-class monoclonal antibody designed to simultaneously target IL-17A and IL-17F. Bimekizumab is currently in clinical development for psoriasis, psoriatic arthritis, and ankylosing spondylitis, with promising results. In early clinical trials, bimekizumab demonstrated a rapid onset of action, good safety profile, and high tolerability by treated study participants. Long-term results and head-to-head trials comparing bimekizumab with other agents will be crucial to define the role of bimekizumab in the treatment of psoriatic disease.

Interleukin (IL)-17 is critical in the pathogenesis of psoriasis and psoriatic arthritis (PsA) with most data suggesting that IL-17A alone was the key cytokine. However, in vitro and in vivo studies have suggested dual blockade of IL-17A and IL-17 F may be more effective than IL-17 A blockade alone. Bimekizumab is the first human monoclonal antibody to exert simultaneous specific inhibition of IL-17A and IL-17 F, and has been studied in several phase II/III trials for psoriasis and PsA. Bimekizumab is not currently licensed for use. A literature search identified clinical trials examining the efficacy and safety of bimekizumab for psoriasis and PsA, and these were critically appraised. Clinical trials of bimekizumab have been promising, demonstrating a rapid onset of response and superior efficacy compared to three currently licensed biologics: secukinumab, ustekinumab, and adalimumab. Bimekizumab maintains a high level of efficacy with maintenance dosing intervals of 8 weeks, compared with 4 weeks for currently licensed IL-17A antagonists. No unexpected adverse events have been identified, although mild-to-moderate fungal infections occur in approximately 10%. Studies over longer time periods involving additional active comparators would be valuable in further defining the role of bimekizumab amongst currently available treatments.
