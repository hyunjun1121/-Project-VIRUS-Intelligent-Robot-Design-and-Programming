The 26S proteasome complex engages in an ATP-dependent proteolytic degradation of a variety of oncoproteins, transcription factors, cell cycle specific cyclins, cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitors, ornithine decarboxylase, and other key regulatory cellular proteins. Thus, the proteasome regulates either directly or indirectly many important cellular processes. Altered regulation of these cellular events is linked to the development of cancer. Therefore, the proteasome has become an attractive target for the treatment of numerous cancers. Several proteasome inhibitors that target the proteolytic active sites of the 26S proteasome complex have been developed and tested for anti-tumor activities. These proteasome inhibitors have displayed impressive anti-tumor functions by inducing apoptosis in different tumor types. Further, the proteasome inhibitors have been shown to induce cell cycle arrest, and inhibit angiogenesis, cell-cell adhesion, cell migration, immune and inflammatory responses, and DNA repair response. A number of proteasome inhibitors are now in clinical trials to treat multiple myeloma and solid tumors. Many other proteasome inhibitors with different efficiencies are being developed and tested for anti-tumor activities. Several proteasome inhibitors currently in clinical trials have shown significantly improved anti-tumor activities when combined with other drugs such as histone deacetylase (HDAC) inhibitors, Akt (protein kinase B) inhibitors, DNA damaging agents, Hsp90 (heat shock protein 90) inhibitors, and lenalidomide. The proteasome inhibitor bortezomib is now in the clinic to treat multiple myeloma and mantle cell lymphoma. Here, we discuss the 26S proteasome complex in carcinogenesis and different proteasome inhibitors with their potential therapeutic applications in treatment of numerous cancers.

Critical cellular processes are regulated, in part, by maintaining the appropriate intracellular levels of proteins. Whereas de novo protein synthesis is a comparatively slow process, proteins are rapidly degraded at a rate compatible with the control of cell cycle transitions and cell death induction. A major pathway for protein degradation is initiated by the addition of multiple 76-amino acid ubiquitin monomers via a three-step process of ubiquitin activation and substrate recognition. Polyubiquitination targets proteins for recognition and processing by the 26S proteasome, a cylindrical organelle that recognizes ubiquitinated proteins, degrades the proteins, and recycles ubiquitin. The critical roles played by ubiquitin-mediated protein turnover in cell cycle regulation makes this process a target for oncogenic mutations. Oncogenes of several common malignancies, for example colon and renal cell cancer, code for ubiquitin ligase components. Cervical oncogenesis by human papillomavirus is also mediated by alteration of ubiquitin ligase pathways. Protein degradation pathways are also targets for cancer therapy, as shown by the successful introduction of bortezomib, an inhibitor of the 26S proteasome. Further work in this area holds great promise toward our understanding and treatment of a wide range of cancers.

The ubiquitin-proteasome system (UPS) degrades 80 - 90% of intracellular proteins. Cancer cells take advantage of the UPS for their increased growth and decreased apoptotic cell death. Thus, the components that make up the UPS represent a diverse group of potential anti-cancer targets. The success of the first-in-class proteasome inhibitor bortezomib not only proved that the proteasome is a feasible and valuable anti-cancer target, but also inspired researchers to extensively explore other potential targets of this pathway. This review provides a broad overview of the UPS and its role in supporting cancer development and progression, especially in aspects of p53 inactivation, p27 turnover and NF-κB activation. Also, efforts toward the development of small molecule inhibitors (SMIs) targeting different steps in this pathway for cancer treatment are reviewed and discussed. Whereas some of the targets in the UPS, such as the 20S proteasome, Nedd8 activating enzyme and HDM2, have been well-established and validated, there remains a large pool of candidates waiting to be investigated. Development of SMIs targeting the UPS has been largely facilitated by state-of-the-art technologies such as high-throughput screening and computer-assisted drug design, both of which require a better understanding of the targets of interest.

The proteasome is a multicatalytic proteinase complex responsible for the degradation of most intracellular proteins, including proteins crucial to cell cycle regulation and programmed cell death, or apoptosis. In preclinical cancer models, proteasome inhibitors induce apoptosis, have in vivo antitumor efficacy, and sensitize malignant cells and tumors to the proapoptotic effects of conventional chemotherapeutics and radiation therapy. Interestingly, transformed cells display greater susceptibility to proteasome inhibition than nonmalignant cells. Therefore, proteasome inhibition holds promise as a novel approach to the treatment of cancer. Inhibitors of the proteasome impact on cells in part through down-regulation of nuclear factor kappaB, but also through modulation of cell cycle proteins and other pro- and antiapoptotic pathways. Bortezomib (VELCADE; formerly PS-341), the first such inhibitor to undergo clinical testing, has demonstrated impressive antitumor activity and manageable toxicities in Phase I and II trials both as a single agent, and in combination with other drugs. It has been approved recently by the Food and Drug Administration for therapy of patients with multiple myeloma who have received at least two prior regimens and progressed on the last of these. Ongoing preclinical evaluations of the mechanisms that underlie the antitumor effects of proteasome inhibitors, and clinical trials in a variety of tumor types, will allow additional refinement of the role these agents will play in cancer therapy. Below we discuss the rationale behind targeting the proteasome for cancer therapy, and review the preclinical and clinical data on proteasome inhibitors alone, and in combination with conventional chemotherapeutics.

The ubiquitin-proteasome system has become a promising molecular target in cancer therapy due to its critical role in cellular protein degradation, interaction with cell cycle and apoptosis regulation, and unique mechanism of action. Bortezomib (PS-341) is a potent and specific reversible proteasome inhibitor, which has shown strong in vitro antitumor activity as single agent and in combination with other cytotoxic drugs in a broad spectrum of hematological and solid malignancies. In preclinical studies, bortezomib induced apoptosis of malignant cells through the inhibition of NF-|B and stabilization of pro-apoptotic proteins. Bortezomib also promotes chemo- and radiosensitization of malignant cells in vitro and inhibits tumor growth in murine xenograft models. The proteasome has been established as a relevant target in hematologic malignancies and bortezomib has been approved for the treatment of multiple myeloma. This review summarizes recent data from clinical trials in solid tumors.

Cellular homeostasis requires routine degradation of key regulatory proteins, including tumor suppressor gene products, transcription factors, cell-cycle proteins and their inhibitors, as well as damaged and misfolded proteins. A critical part of this process is mediated by the 26S proteasome, a multi-subunit enzyme found in the nucleus and cytoplasm of all eukaryotic cells. Because of its essential role in many cellular processes controlling growth and survival, the proteasome has been identified as a potential target for cancer therapy. Drugs known to inhibit proteasome activity have been shown to induce cell-cycle arrest and programmed cell death (apoptosis). The impact of this finding is heightened by research showing that cancer cells are more sensitive to the proapoptotic effects of proteasome inhibition than normal cells. Preclinical evidence using bortezomib, the only proteasome inhibitor to enter clinical trials, suggests that proteasome inhibition may be effective in the treatment of hematologic and solid malignancies by promoting apoptosis, retarding angiogenesis, and inhibiting tumor cell adhesion and production of growth factors by acting on molecules such as nuclear factor-kappaB. Further preclinical evidence suggests that the antitumor effects of cytotoxic chemotherapy or radiotherapy may be enhanced by the addition of a proteasome inhibitor. Bortezomib was recently approved for the treatment of multiple myeloma. It is currently being investigated, both as a single agent and in combination, in phase I and II trials in a variety of tumor types.

The ubiquitin-proteasome pathway has been identified as a potential molecular target for cancer therapy. In this study, we investigated the effect of the proteasome inhibitor bortezomib on anaplastic thyroid carcinoma (ATC) characterized by complete refractoriness to multimodal therapeutic approaches. The ATC cell lines C643 and SW1736 were treated with bortezomib (1 nM to 1 μM) for 12-72 h. Thereafter, growth inhibition was analyzed by thymidine uptake experiments and determination of the viable cell number. Apoptosis was measured and a cell cycle analysis was done. Using gene chip analysis and the real-time quantitative PCR system, we measured transcriptional changes. The activity of the nuclear factor (NF)-κB and p53 signal transduction pathways was monitored using the reporter constructs pNF-κB-TA-Luc and pp53-TA-Luc in the luciferase activity assay. Uptake measurements using (3)H-FDG, (14)C-aminoisobutyric acid, and Na(125)iodide were performed to investigate metabolic changes and iodide symporter activity in vitro. Moreover, the (18)F-FDG uptake was evaluated in ATC tumor-bearing nude mice 1 or 2 d after treatment with bortezomib. Bortezomib induced growth inhibition, apoptosis, and G(2)-M cell cycle arrest associated with upregulation of p21(CIP1/WAF1) expression in SW1736 and C643 cells. Moreover, the glucose metabolism and aminoisobutyric acid uptake significantly decreased in vitro in both of the ATC cell lines in vivo only in SW1736 tumors at 2 d after the bortezomib treatment. The transcriptional profile in bortezomib-treated SW1736 and C643 cells revealed increased expression of genes involved in stress response, apoptosis, regulation of the cell cycle, and differentiation. Using real-time quantitative PCR for the quantification of gene expression, we additionally noticed upregulation of the tumor necrosis factor-related apoptosis-inducing ligand and the thyroid-specific transcription factors Pax8 and TTF-1, leading to expression of the thyroid-specific target genes thyroglobulin, sodium iodide symporter, thyroperoxidase, and thyroid-stimulating hormone receptor and to a moderate accumulation of iodide in ATC cells. On the basis of our data, bortezomib represents a promising antineoplastic agent for the treatment of ATC. To improve the clinical outcome, further investigation into the potential of bortezomib therapy of thyroid cancer is clearly warranted.

The ubiquitin-proteasome system plays a critical role in controlling the level, activity and location of various cellular proteins. Significant progress has been made in investigating the molecular mechanisms of ubiquitination, particularly in understanding the structure of the ubiquitination machinery and identifying ubiquitin protein ligases, the primary specificity-determining enzymes. Therefore, it is now possible to target specific molecules involved in ubiquitination and proteasomal degradation to regulate many cellular processes such as signal transduction, proliferation and apoptosis. In particular, alterations in ubiquitination are observed in most, if not all, cancer cells. This is manifested by destabilization of tumor suppressors, such as p53, and overexpression of oncogenes such as c-Myc and c-Jun. In addition to the development and clinical validation of proteasome inhibitor, bortezomib, in myeloma therapy, recent studies have demonstrated that it is possible to develop inhibitors for specific ubiquitination and deubiquitination enzymes. With the help of structural studies, rational design and chemical synthesis, it is conceivable that we will be able to use 'druggable' inhibitors of the ubiquitin system to evaluate their effects in animal tumor models in the not-so-distant future.

The estrogen receptor-α (ERα) determines the phenotype of breast cancers where it serves as a positive prognostic indicator. ERα is a well-established target for breast cancer therapy, but strategies to target its function remain of interest to address therapeutic resistance and further improve treatment. Recent findings indicate that proteasome inhibition can regulate estrogen-induced transcription, but how ERα function might be regulated was uncertain. In this study, we investigated the transcriptome-wide effects of the proteasome inhibitor bortezomib on estrogen-regulated transcription in MCF7 human breast cancer cells and showed that bortezomib caused a specific global decrease in estrogen-induced gene expression. This effect was specific because gene expression induced by the glucocorticoid receptor was unaffected by bortezomib. Surprisingly, we observed no changes in ERα recruitment or assembly of its transcriptional activation complex on ERα target genes. Instead, we found that proteasome inhibition caused a global decrease in histone H2B monoubiquitination (H2Bub1), leading to transcriptional elongation defects on estrogen target genes and to decreased chromatin dynamics overall. In confirming the functional significance of this link, we showed that RNA interference-mediated knockdown of the H2B ubiquitin ligase RNF40 decreased ERα-induced gene transcription. Surprisingly, RNF40 knockdown also supported estrogen-independent cell proliferation and activation of cell survival signaling pathways. Most importantly, we found that H2Bub1 levels decrease during tumor progression. H2Bub1 was abundant in normal mammary epithelium and benign breast tumors but absent in most malignant and metastatic breast cancers. Taken together, our findings show how ERα activity is blunted by bortezomib treatment as a result of reducing the downstream ubiquitin-dependent function of H2Bub1. In supporting a tumor suppressor role for H2Bub1 in breast cancer, our findings offer a rational basis to pursue H2Bub1-based therapies for future management of breast cancer.

The ubiquitin-proteasome pathway is involved in intracellular protein turnover, and its function is crucial to cellular homeostasis. First synthesized as probes of proteolytic processes, proteasome inhibitors began to be thought of as potential drug candidates when they were found to induce programmed cell death preferentially in transformed cells. They made their first leap into the clinic to be tested as therapeutic agents 10 years ago, and since then, great strides have been made in defining their mechanisms of action, their clinical efficacy and toxicity, and some of their limitations in the form of resistance pathways. Validation of the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway as a target for cancer therapy has come in the form of approvals of the first such inhibitor, bortezomib, for relapsed/refractory multiple myeloma and mantle cell lymphoma, for which this agent has become a standard of care. Lessons learned from this first-in-class agent are now being applied to the development of a new generation of proteasome inhibitors that hold the promise of efficacy in bortezomib-resistant disease and possibly in a broader spectrum of diseases. This saga provides a salient example of the promise of translational medicine and a paradigm by which other agents may be successfully brought from the bench to the bedside.

The ubiquitin-proteasome pathway regulates many basic cellular processes and has been proven to be a promising target for cancer therapy. Bortezomib is the first U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved proteasome inhibitor used in the treatment of newly diagnosed multiple myeloma, relapsed/refractory multiple myeloma, and mantle cell lymphoma. The anti-cancer mechanisms of bortezomib elucidated by preclinical studies include: upregulation of proapoptotic proteins (e.g., Noxa, IκB), inhibition of NFκB and its anti-apoptotic target genes, suppression of several anti-apoptotic proteins (e.g., Bcl-XL, Bcl-2, and STAT-3), down-regulation of expression of several proteins involved in DNA repair pathways, and induction of endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress and pro-apoptotic Unfolded Protein Response (UPR). Bortezomib has potent chemo-/radio-sensitizing effects and can overcome traditional drug resistance in tumors when used in combination with potential chemotherapies. Although bortezomib has been successful in improving clinical outcomes when used in hematological malignancies, relapse may occur in those patients who responded initially. Furthermore, some cytotoxicities (such as peripheral neuropathy) were found to be associated with bortezomib treatment. These observations have encouraged researchers to search for the next generation proteasome inhibitors (including carfilzomib and marizomib) that could overcome bortezomib resistance and have improved properties, reduced toxicities, and broader anticancer activities, based on the lessons learned from the mechanisms and use of bortezomib. This review summarizes the current status of bortezomib as well as several other proteasome inhibitors that are currently under clinical and preclinical investigation.

E3 ubiquitin ligases are a large family of proteins that can be classified into three major structurally distinct types: N-end rule E3s, E3s containing the HECT (Homology to E6AP C-Terminus) domain, and E3s with the RING (Really Interesting New Gene) finger, including its derivatives, the U- Box and the PHD (Plant Homeo-Domain). E3 ubiquitin ligases exist as single polypeptide or multimeric complexes. Together with ubiquitin activating enzyme E1 and ubiquitin conjugating enzyme E2, E3 ubiquitin ligases catalyze the ubiquitination of a variety of protein substrates for targeted degradation via the 26S proteasome. E3 ubiqutin ligases, therefore, play an essential role in regulation of many biological processes. Furthermore, E3s are enzymes that determine the specificity of protein substrates; they represent a class of "drugable" targets for pharmaceutical intervention. In this review, I will mainly focus on E3 ubiquitin ligases as potential cancer targets and discuss three of the most promising E3s, Mdm2/Hdm2, IAPs, and SCF, for their target rationales, target validation, and critical issues associated with them. These E3 ligases or their components are overexpressed in many human cancers and their inhibition leads to growth suppression or apoptosis. In addition, I will evaluate two current methodologies available for the high throughput screening for small molecular weight chemical inhibitors of the E3 ubiquitin ligases. Although targeting E3 ubiquitin ligases is still in its infancy, speedy approval of the general proteasome inhibitor, Velcade (bortezomib) by the FDA for the treatment of relapsed and refractory multiple myeloma suggests the promise of specific E3 inhibitors in anti-cancer therapy. Emerging technologies, such as siRNA, will provide a better validation of many E3s. It is anticipated that E3 ubiquitin ligases will represent an important new target platform for future mechanism-driven drug discovery.

Selective degradation of proteins by the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway is a critical determinant for maintaining cellular homeostasis. Most intracellular proteins are degraded by the proteasome, a multicatalytic enzyme complex containing a 20S catalytic core and two 19S regulatory complexes. Many proteasome target proteins are involved in the regulation of important processes of carcinogenesis and cancer cell survival, such as cell cycle progression, cell proliferation, differentiation and apoptosis. Indeed, the ubiquitin-proteasome-dependent degradation pathway plays an essential role in both the up-regulation of cell proliferation and down-regulation of cell death in human cancer cells. Both in vitro and in vivo experimental and clinical results have demonstrated the potential use of proteasome inhibitors as novel anticancer drugs. Proteasome inhibition in cancer cells leads to accumulation of pro-apoptotic target proteins followed by induction of cell death. The clinical efficacy of the proteasome inhibitor bortezomib toward multiple myeloma and other hematologic malignancies provides the "proof of concept" that targeting the proteasome is a promising strategy for cancer treatment. Several other proteasome inhibitors have also been identified from natural resources, such as marine microbial metabolites, green tea polyphenols, flavonoids, and medicinal compounds. Additionally, the use of metal complexes as proteasome inhibitors has also been investigated as a potential anticancer strategy. The clinical significance of targeting the tumor survival-associated proteasome pathway for cancer treatment, intervention and prevention will be discussed.

The ubiquitin-proteasome system has recently emerged as a major target for drug development in cancer therapy. The proteasome inhibitor bortezomib has clinical activity in multiple myeloma and mantle cell lymphoma. Here we report that Eeyarestatin I (EerI), a chemical inhibitor that blocks endoplasmic reticulum (ER)-associated protein degradation, has antitumor and biologic activities similar to bortezomib and can synergize with bortezomib. Like bortezomib, EerI-induced cytotoxicity requires the up-regulation of the Bcl-2 homology3 (BH3)-only pro-apoptotic protein NOXA. We further demonstrate that both EerI and bortezomib activate NOXA via an unanticipated mechanism that requires cooperation between two processes. First, these agents elicit an integrated stress response program at the ER to activate the CREB/ATF transcription factors ATF3 and ATF4. We show that ATF3 and ATF4 form a complex capable of binding to the NOXA promoter, which is required for NOXA activation. Second, EerI and bortezomib also block ubiquitination of histone H2A to relieve its inhibition on NOXA transcription. Our results identify a class of anticancer agents that integrate ER stress response with an epigenetic mechanism to induce cell death.

The ubiquitin-proteasome system (UPS) is a conserved pathway regulating numerous biological processes including protein turnover, DNA repair, and intracellular trafficking. Tumor cells are dependent on a functioning UPS, making it an ideal target for the development of novel anti-cancer therapies. The development of bortezomib (Velcade(®)) as a treatment for multiple myeloma and mantle cell lymphoma has verified this and suggests that targeting other components of the UPS may be a viable strategy for the treatment for cancer. We recently described a novel class of proteasome inhibitors that function by an alternative mechanism of action (D'Arcy et al., 2011). The small molecule b-AP15 blocks the deubiquitinase (DUB) activity of the 19S regulatory particle (19S RP) without inhibiting the proteolytic activities of the 20S core particle (20S CP). b-AP15 inhibits two proteasome-associated DUBs, USP14 and UCHL5, resulting in a rapid accumulation of high molecular weight ubiquitin conjugates and a functional proteasome shutdown. Interestingly, b-AP15 displays several differences to bortezomib including insensitivity to over-expression of the anti-apoptotic mediator Bcl-2 and anti-tumor activity in solid tumor models. In this review we will discuss the potential of proteasome deubiquitinase inhibitors as additions to the therapeutic arsenal against cancer.

Ubiquitin-tagged substrates are degraded by the 26S proteasome, which is a multisubunit complex comprising a proteolytic 20S core particle capped by 19S regulatory particles. The approval of bortezomib for the treatment of multiple myeloma validated the 20S core particle as an anticancer drug target. Here we describe the small molecule b-AP15 as a previously unidentified class of proteasome inhibitor that abrogates the deubiquitinating activity of the 19S regulatory particle. b-AP15 inhibited the activity of two 19S regulatory-particle-associated deubiquitinases, ubiquitin C-terminal hydrolase 5 (UCHL5) and ubiquitin-specific peptidase 14 (USP14), resulting in accumulation of polyubiquitin. b-AP15 induced tumor cell apoptosis that was insensitive to TP53 status and overexpression of the apoptosis inhibitor BCL2. We show that treatment with b-AP15 inhibited tumor progression in four different in vivo solid tumor models and inhibited organ infiltration in an acute myeloid leukemia model. Our results show that the deubiquitinating activity of the 19S regulatory particle is a new anticancer drug target.

A major challenge in cancer therapy is tumor drug resistance. To overcome it, it is essential to understand the mechanisms and identify the molecules involved, so that they can be specifically targeted in combination therapies. The proteasome is such a validated target: it plays a key role in cancer cell proliferation, inhibition of chemotherapy-induced apoptosis and drug resistance development. Bortezomib (Velcade, PS-341) was the first proteasome inhibitor to receive regulatory approval from the US Food and Drug Administration for the treatment of multiple myeloma. Clinical combination trials have demonstrated a chemo-sensitizing effect of bortezomib on conventional agents in hematological malignancies and some solid tumors such as androgen-independent prostate and ovarian cancer. Although generally well-tolerated, bortezomib still generates toxicity which underscores the need for less toxic proteasome inhibitors. Several naturally occurring products, such as green tea polyphenols and the antibiotic lactacystin, have been shown to be potent proteasome inhibitors. Significantly, green tea polyphenols, as well as several flavonoids such as genistein, curcumin and resveratrol, have also been shown to have chemo-sensitizing properties in prostate, breast, hepatic, and lung tumors. Further studies on natural proteasome inhibitors as chemo-sensitizers could lead to identification of more potent and less toxic compounds that could be used in combination therapies for drug-resistant tumors.

The ubiquitin-proteasome system has become a promising novel molecular target in cancer due to its critical role in cellular protein degradation, its interaction with cell cycle and apoptosis regulation and its unique mechanism of action. This review focuses both on preclinical results and on data from clinical trials with proteasome inhibitors in cancer. Results in hematological malignancies and solid tumors were included, and important data presented in abstract form were considered in this review. Bortezomib as first-in-class proteasome inhibitor has proven to be highly effective in some hematological malignancies, overcomes conventional chemoresistance, directly induces cell cycle arrest and apoptosis, and also targets the tumor microenvironment. It has been granted approval by the FDA for relapsed multiple myeloma, and recently for relapsed mantle cell lymphoma. Combination chemotherapy regimens have been developed providing high remission rates and remission quality in frontline treatment or in the relapsed setting in multiple myeloma. The combination of proteasome inhibition with novel targeted therapies is an emerging field in oncology. Moreover, novel proteasome inhibitors, such as NPI-0052 and carfilzomib, have been developed. This review summarizes our knowledge of the ubiquitin-proteasome system and recent data from cancer clinical trials.

Proteasome inhibitors represent novel anti-cancer drugs which interact with the proteasome-ubiquitin pathway. The 26S proteasome is a multicatalytic threonine protease with three distinct catalytic activities. It is responsible for intracellular protein turnover in eukaryotic cells, including the processing and degradation of short- and some long-living proteins required for regulation of various cellular functions. Subsequently, the inhibition of the proteasomal function results in stabilization and accumulation of its substrates, which notably include cyclins, cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitors, transcriptional factors, tumor suppressor proteins and proto-oncogenes. This results in confounding signals in the cell inducing cell cycle arrest and activation of apoptotic programs. Acting on transcriptional factor NF-kappaB, which is upregulated in some tumors undergoing chemotherapy or irradiation and downregulated by proteasome inhibition, a significant chemosensitization and consequently synergistic effects concerning the anti-tumor activity could be achieved. Bortezomib is the first proteasome inhibitor that has entered clinical trials. In multiple myeloma, both the US Food and Drug Administration and European Medicine Evaluation Agency granted approval for the use of bortezomib (Velcade) for the treatment of multiple myeloma patients who have received at least two prior therapies and have demonstrated disease progression on the last therapy. At present, other trials examine the activity in a variety of solid tumors and hematological malignancies. This paper reviews preclinical and clinical results.

Cutaneous malignant melanoma is an aggressive type of skin cancer which causes disproportionate mortality in young and middle-aged adults. Once disseminated, melanoma can be considered an incurable disease, highly resistant to standard antineoplastic treatment, such as chemotherapy or radiation therapy. The proteasome represents a novel target for cancer therapy that can potentially be used in melanoma. To assess the effect of four structurally different proteasome inhibitors on human cutaneous melanoma-derived cell lines. Sixteen human cutaneous melanoma-derived cell lines which are original were obtained from patients who were treated by two of the authors. Cells were cultured, exposed to proteasome inhibitors (bortezomib, ALLN, MG-132 and epoxomicin) and then assayed for cell cycle and cell death analyses. Proteasome inhibitors inhibited the in vitro growth of melanoma cells, and this effect was due to a reduction in cell proliferation rate and an induction of both caspase-dependent and caspase-independent cell death. Moreover, release of apoptosis-inducing factor was observed in the presence of the broad-specificity caspase inhibitor BAF (Boc-D-fmk). In addition, the four different proteasome inhibitors induced caspase 2 processing. This study provides information regarding the in vitro effects of proteasome inhibitors on melanoma cell lines, and the molecular mechanisms involved. It also gives support to the future use of such inhibitors in the treatment of patients with melanoma, either administered alone or in combination with other drugs.

The ubiquitin-proteasome pathway plays a central role in the degradation of proteins involved in several pathways including the cell cycle, cellular proliferation and apoptosis. Bortezomib is the first proteasome inhibitor to enter clinical use, and received approval by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for the treatment of patients with multiple myeloma, therefore validating inhibition of the proteasome as an anticancer target. The approval of Bortezomib was based on a large, international, multicenter phase III trial showing its efficacy and safety compared with conventional therapy. Preclinical data also demonstrates the synergistic effect of bortezomib with other chemotherapeutic agents and its ability to overcome drug resistance. Since then several other proteasome inhibitors have been developed. The anti-tumor activities of bortezomib have been attributed to its effect on pro-apoptotic pathways including the inhibition of NF-kappaB and induction of endoplasmic reticulum stress. However, the molecular mechanisms are not fully understood. In this review, we will summarize the molecular mechanism of apoptosis by bortezomib.

The proteasome has emerged as an important target for cancer therapy with the approval of bortezomib, a first-in-class, reversible proteasome inhibitor, for relapsed/refractory multiple myeloma (MM). However, many patients have disease that does not respond to bortezomib, whereas others develop resistance, suggesting the need for other inhibitors with enhanced activity. We therefore evaluated a novel, irreversible, epoxomicin-related proteasome inhibitor, carfilzomib. In models of MM, this agent potently bound and specifically inhibited the chymotrypsin-like proteasome and immunoproteasome activities, resulting in accumulation of ubiquitinated substrates. Carfilzomib induced a dose- and time-dependent inhibition of proliferation, ultimately leading to apoptosis. Programmed cell death was associated with activation of c-Jun-N-terminal kinase, mitochondrial membrane depolarization, release of cytochrome c, and activation of both intrinsic and extrinsic caspase pathways. This agent also inhibited proliferation and activated apoptosis in patient-derived MM cells and neoplastic cells from patients with other hematologic malignancies. Importantly, carfilzomib showed increased efficacy compared with bortezomib and was active against bortezomib-resistant MM cell lines and samples from patients with clinical bortezomib resistance. Carfilzomib also overcame resistance to other conventional agents and acted synergistically with dexamethasone to enhance cell death. Taken together, these data provide a rationale for the clinical evaluation of carfilzomib in MM.

The 26S proteasome is a promising new target for breast cancer therapy. The degradation of proteins by the proteasome is an essential metabolic process, and inhibition of the proteasome results in cell-cycle arrest and apoptosis. However, cancer cells and proliferating blood vessels appear to be particularly sensitive to the effects of proteasome inhibition. Studies carried out in breast cancer cells and murine xenograft models of breast cancer have demonstrated the potent antitumor effects of proteasome inhibition in this disease. Proteasome inhibition interferes with many cell signaling pathways, including those involved in the development and progression of breast cancer. The potent and selective proteasome inhibitor bortezomib (VELCADE; formerly known as PS-341) is particularly promising as a potential anticancer agent. PS-341 is the first proteasome inhibitor to be extensively studied in murine models of cancer and to progress to clinical trials in cancer patients. Preliminary clinical data from patients with a range of malignancies indicate that the drug effectively inhibits proteasome activity at doses associated with manageable toxicity. Early clinical trials are currently recruiting participants for the analysis of PS-341 activity in breast cancer.

The increasing appreciation of the importance of autophagy as consequence of cancer therapy or underlying disease biology is illustrated by the large number of papers that are evaluating autophagy as a cancer target. While autophagy is often linked to the generation of metabolic precursors, it is also important in diseases where protein production is a hallmark of the disease itself, such as pancreatic cancer and multiple myeloma. Multiple myeloma is characterized by ongoing autophagy as a consequence of constitutive immunoglobulin production, which creates the need for efficient transfer and disposal of misfolded or unfolded proteins. In order to survive this cellular stress, plasma cells depend on proteasomal degradation of the large volume of misfolded proteins as well as the autophagy pathway. It has previously been suggested that the excess proteins not targeted to the proteasome, or that accumulate when the proteasome is inhibited through the use of chemically active agents such as bortezomib, are linked to impaired cell survival, and that their packaging in the form of an aggresome somehow minimizes their 'proteotoxicity' allowing these toxic proteins to be sequestered away from normal cellular machinery.
