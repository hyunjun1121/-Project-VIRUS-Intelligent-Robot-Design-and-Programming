IDEAL_ANSWER:
- h3k9me3 is the major histone mark that is recognized by hp1.
- Here, we present structural, energetic, and mutational analyses of the complex between the Drosophila HP1 chromodomain and the histone H3 tail with a methyllysine at residue 9, a modification associated with epigenetic silencing Methylation of histone H3 lysine 9 creates a binding site for HP1 proteins.
- Histone H3 at lysine 9 trimethylation (H3K9me3)
- Histone H3 at lysine 9 (H3K9me3)
- Methylation of histone H3 lysine 9 creates a binding site for HP1 proteins. We show that methylated lysine 9 of histone H3 (Me9H3) is a marker of heterochromatin in divergent animal species.
- HP1 can bind with high affinity to histone H3 methylated at lysine 9 but not at lysine 4. Methylation of lysine 9 in histone H3 is recognized by heterochromatin protein 1 (HP1), which directs the binding of other proteins to control chromatin structure and gene expression.
- Methylation of lysine 9 in histone H3 is recognized by heterochromatin protein 1 (HP1), which directs the binding of other proteins to control chromatin structure and gene expression.
- Methylation of histone H3 lysine 9 creates a binding site for HP1 proteins.  Here we show that mammalian methyltransferases that selectively methylate histone H3 on lysine 9 (Suv39h HMTases) generate a binding site for HP1 proteins--a family of heterochromatic adaptor molecules implicated in both gene silencing and supra-nucleosomal chromatin structure.
