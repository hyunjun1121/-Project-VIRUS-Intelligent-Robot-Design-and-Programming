What are the end products of the shikimate pathway?

In plants, the shikimate pathway generally occurs in plastids and leads to the biosynthesis of aromatic amino acids. Chorismate synthase (CS) catalyses the last step of the conversion of 5-enolpyruvylshikimate 3-phosphate (EPSP) to chorismate, but the role of CS in the metabolism of higher plants has not been reported. In this study, we found that PhCS, which is encoded by a single-copy gene in petunia (Petunia hybrida), contains N-terminal plastidic transit peptides and peroxisomal targeting signals. Green fluorescent protein (GFP) fusion protein assays revealed that PhCS was localized in chloroplasts and, unexpectedly, in peroxisomes. Petunia plants with reduced PhCS activity were generated through virus-induced gene silencing and further characterized. PhCS silencing resulted in reduced CS activity, severe growth retardation, abnormal flower and leaf development and reduced levels of folate and pigments, including chlorophylls, carotenoids and anthocyanins. A widely targeted metabolomics analysis showed that most primary and secondary metabolites were significantly changed in pTRV2-PhCS-treated corollas. Overall, the results revealed a clear connection between primary and specialized metabolism related to the shikimate pathway in petunia.

Glyphosate is one of the most widely used herbicides and it is suspected to affect the intestinal microbiota through inhibition of aromatic amino acid synthesis via the shikimate pathway. In vitro microbiome bioreactors are increasingly used as model systems to investigate effects on intestinal microbiota and consequently methods for the quantitation of glyphosate and its degradation product aminomethylphosphonic acid (AMPA) in microbiome model systems are required. An optimized protocol enables the analysis of both glyphosate and AMPA by simple extraction with methanol:acetonitrile:water (2:3:1) without further enrichment steps. Glyphosate and AMPA are separated by liquid chromatography on an amide column and identified and quantified with a targeted tandem mass spectrometry method using a QTRAP 5500 system (AB Sciex). Our method has a limit of detection (LOD) in extracted water samples of <2 ng/mL for both glyphosate and AMPA. In complex intestinal medium, the LOD is 2 and 5 ng/mL for glyphosate and AMPA, respectively. These LODs allow for measurement at exposure-relevant concentrations. Glyphosate levels in a bioreactor model of porcine colon were determined and consequently it was verified whether AMPA was produced by porcine gut microbiota. The method presented here allows quantitation of glyphosate and AMPA in complex bioreactor fluids and thus enables studies of the impact of glyphosate and its metabolism on intestinal microbiota. In addition, the extraction protocol is compatible with an untargeted metabolomics analysis, thus allowing one to look for other perturbations caused by glyphosate in the same sample.

The most common route to produce aromatic chemicals - organic compounds containing at least one benzene ring in their structure - is chemical synthesis. These processes, usually starting from an extracted fossil oil molecule such as benzene, toluene, or xylene, are highly environmentally unfriendly due to the use of non-renewable raw materials, high energy consumption and the usual production of toxic by-products. An alternative way to produce aromatic compounds is extraction from plants. These extractions typically have a low yield and a high purification cost. This motivates the search for alternative platforms to produce aromatic compounds through low-cost and environmentally friendly processes. Microorganisms are able to synthesize aromatic amino acids through the shikimate pathway. The construction of microbial cell factories able to produce the desired molecule from renewable feedstock becomes a promising alternative. This review article focuses on the recent advances in microbial production of aromatic products, with a special emphasis on metabolic engineering strategies, as well as bioprocess optimization. The recent combination of these two techniques has resulted in the development of several alternative processes to produce phenylpropanoids, aromatic alcohols, phenolic aldehydes, and others. Chemical species that were unavailable for human consumption due to the high cost and/or high environmental impact of their production, have now become accessible.

The shikimate pathway is indispensable for the biosynthesis of natural products with aromatic moieties. These products have wide current and potential applications in food, cosmetics and medicine, and consequently have great commercial value. However, compounds extracted from various plants or synthesized from petrochemicals no longer satisfy the requirements of contemporary industries. As a result, an increasing number of studies has focused on this pathway to enable the biotechnological manufacture of natural products, especially in E. coli. Furthermore, the development of synthetic biology, systems metabolic engineering and high flux screening techniques has also contributed to improving the biosynthesis of high-value compounds based on the shikimate pathway. Here, we review approaches based on a combination of traditional and new metabolic engineering strategies to increase the metabolic flux of the shikimate pathway. In addition, applications of this optimized pathway to produce aromatic amino acids and a range of natural products is also elaborated. Finally, this review sums up the opportunities and challenges facing this field.

Allosteric regulation is important in many biological processes, including cell signaling, gene regulation, and metabolism. <i>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</i> chorismate mutase (ScCM) is a key homodimeric enzyme in the shikimate pathway responsible for the generation of aromatic amino acids, where it is allosterically inhibited and activated by Tyr and Trp, respectively. Our previous studies indicated that binding of both allosteric effectors is negatively cooperative, that is binding at one allosteric binding site discourages binding at the other, due to the entropic penalty of binding the second allosteric effector. We utilized variable temperature isothermal titration calorimetry (ITC) and nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) experiments to better understand the entropic contributions to allosteric effector binding, including changes to solvent entropy and protein conformational entropy. Upon binding either Tyr or Trp, ScCM experiences a quenching of motions on the picosecond-to-nanosecond time scale, which we could relate to a loss of protein conformational entropy. Further ITC and NMR studies were consistent with the Tyr-bound form of ScCM being associated with more water molecules compared to the Trp-bound form and Tyr binding being associated with a less positive solvent entropy change. These studies provide insight into the role of structural dynamics in ScCM function and highlight the importance of solvent entropy changes in allosteric regulation, a historically underappreciated concept.
