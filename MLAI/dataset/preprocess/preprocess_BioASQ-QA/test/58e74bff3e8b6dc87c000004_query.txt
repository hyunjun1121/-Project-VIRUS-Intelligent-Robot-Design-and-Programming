Which class of genes are mutated in Diamond Blackfan Anemia patients?

[PMID: 11112378]
Diamond-Blackfan anemia (DBA) is a congenital disease characterized by defective erythroid progenitor maturation and physical malformations. Most cases are sporadic, but dominant or, more rarely, recessive inheritance is observed in 10% of patients. Mutations in the gene encoding ribosomal protein (RP) S19 have recently been found in 25% of patients with either the dominant or the sporadic form. DBA is the first human disease due to mutations in a ribosomal structural protein. Families unlinked to this locus have also been reported. In an investigation of 23 individuals, we identified eight different mutations in 9 patients. These include five missense, one frameshift, one splice site defect, and one 4-bp insertion in the regulatory sequence. Seven mutations are new; one has so far been found in 8 patients and is a relatively common de novo event. Two mutations are predicted to generate a truncated protein. We also report the prevalence of RPS 19 mutations in the Italian DBA population, as shown by an analysis of 56 patients. No genotype-phenotype correlation was found between patients with the same mutation. The main clinical applications for molecular analysis are clinical diagnosis of patients with an incomplete form of DBA and testing of siblings of a patient with a severe form so as to avoid using those who carry a mutation and a silent phenotype as allogeneic stem cell donors.

Diamond Blackfan anemia (DBA) is an inherited erythroblastopenia associated with mutations in at least 8 different ribosomal protein genes. Mutations in the gene encoding ribosomal protein S19 (RPS19) have been identified in approximately 25% of DBA families. Most of these mutations disrupt either the translation or stability of the RPS19 protein and are predicted to cause DBA by haploinsufficiency. However, approximately 30% of RPS19 mutations are missense mutations that do not alter the stability of the RPS19 protein and are hypothesized to act by a dominant negative mechanism. To formally test this hypothesis, we generated a transgenic mouse model expressing an RPS19 mutation in which an arginine residue is replaced with a tryptophan residue at codon 62 (RPS19R62W). Constitutive expression of RPS19R62W in developing mice was lethal. Conditional expression of RPS19R62W resulted in growth retardation, a mild anemia with reduced numbers of erythroid progenitors, and significant inhibition of terminal erythroid maturation, similar to DBA. RNA profiling demonstrated more than 700 dysregulated genes belonging to the same pathways that are disrupted in RNA profiles of DBA patient cells. We conclude that RPS19R62W is a dominant negative DBA mutation.

Mutations in the ribosomal protein S19 gene (RPS19) have been found in 25% of patients with Diamond-Blackfan anemia, a rare syndrome of congenital bone marrow failure characterized by erythroblastopenia and various malformations. Mechanistic understanding of the role of RPS19 in normal erythropoiesis and in the Diamond-Blackfan anemia defect is still poor. However, defective ribosome biogenesis and, in particular, impaired 18S ribosomal RNA maturation have been documented in association with various identified RPS19 mutations. Recently, new genes, all encoding ribosomal proteins, have been found to be mutated in Diamond-Blackfan anemia, adding further support to the concept that ribosome biogenesis plays an important role in regulating erythropoiesis. We previously showed variability in the levels of expression and subcellular localization of a subset of RPS19 mutant proteins. To define the mechanistic basis for this variability better, we studied a large number of mutant proteins and characterized both RPS19 expression level using a specific antibody against RPS19 and RPS19 subcellular localization after transfection of Cos-7 cells with various green fluorescent protein-RPS19 mutants. To investigate the role of the proteasome in RPS19 degradation, we examined the effect of various proteasome inhibitors, namely lactacystin, MG132, and bortezomib on RPS19 expression and subcellular localization We found two distinct classes of RPS19 protein defects in Diamond-Blackfan anemia based on the stability of the mutant proteins: (i) slightly decreased to normal levels of expression and normal nucleolar localization and (ii) markedly deficient expression and failure to localize to the nucleolus. All the proteasome inhibitors tested were able to restore the expression levels and normal subcellular localization of several unstable mutant proteins. Our findings demonstrate an important role for the proteasomal degradation pathway in regulating the expression levels and nucleolar localization of certain mutant RPS19 proteins in Diamond-Blackfan anemia.

Diamond-Blackfan Anemia (DBA) is characterized by a defect of erythroid progenitors and, clinically, by anemia and malformations. DBA exhibits an autosomal dominant pattern of inheritance with incomplete penetrance. Currently nine genes, all encoding ribosomal proteins (RP), have been found mutated in approximately 50% of patients. Experimental evidence supports the hypothesis that DBA is primarily the result of defective ribosome synthesis. By means of a large collaboration among six centers, we report here a mutation update that includes nine genes and 220 distinct mutations, 56 of which are new. The DBA Mutation Database now includes data from 355 patients. Of those where inheritance has been examined, 125 patients carry a de novo mutation and 72 an inherited mutation. Mutagenesis may be ascribed to slippage in 65.5% of indels, whereas CpG dinucleotides are involved in 23% of transitions. Using bioinformatic tools we show that gene conversion mechanism is not common in RP genes mutagenesis, notwithstanding the abundance of RP pseudogenes. Genotype-phenotype analysis reveals that malformations are more frequently associated with mutations in RPL5 and RPL11 than in the other genes. All currently reported DBA mutations together with their functional and clinical data are included in the DBA Mutation Database.

Diamond-Blackfan anemia is an autosomal dominant disease due to mutations in nine ribosomal protein encoding genes. Because most mutations are loss of function and detected by direct sequencing of coding exons, we reasoned that part of the approximately 50% mutation negative patients may have carried a copy number variant of ribosomal protein genes. As a proof of concept, we designed a multiplex ligation-dependent probe amplification assay targeted to screen the six genes that are most frequently mutated in Diamond-Blackfan anemia patients: RPS17, RPS19, RPS26, RPL5, RPL11, and RPL35A. Using this assay we showed that deletions represent approximately 20% of all mutations. The combination of sequencing and multiplex ligation-dependent probe amplification analysis of these six genes allows the genetic characterization of approximately 65% of patients, showing that Diamond-Blackfan anemia is indisputably a ribosomopathy.

Diamond-Blackfan anemia (DBA) is a congenital erythroid aplasia characterized as a normochromic macrocytic anemia with a selective deficiency in red blood cell precursors in otherwise normocellular bone marrow. In 40% of DBA patients, various physical anomalies are also present. Currently two genes are associated with the DBA phenotype--the ribosomal protein (RP) S19 mutated in 25% of DBA patients and RPS24 mutated in approximately 1.4% of DBA patients. Here we report the identification of a mutation in yet another ribosomal protein, RPS17. The mutation affects the translation initiation start codon, changing T to G (c.2T>G), thus eliminating the natural start of RPS17 protein biosynthesis. RNA analysis revealed that the mutated allele was expressed, and the next downstream start codon located at position +158 should give rise to a short peptide of only four amino acids (Met-Ser-Arg-Ile). The mutation arose de novo, since all healthy family members carry the wild-type alleles. The identification of a mutation in the third RP of the small ribosomal subunit in DBA patients further supports the theory that impaired translation may be the main cause of DBA pathogenesis.

The gene encoding ribosomal protein S19 (RPS19) has been shown to be mutated in 25% of the patients affected by Diamond-Blackfan anemia (DBA), a congenital erythroblastopenia. As the role of RPS19 in erythropoiesis is still to be defined, we performed studies on RPS19 expression during terminal erythroid differentiation. Comparative analysis of the genomic sequences of human and mouse RPS19 genes enabled the identification of 4 conserved sequence elements in the 5' region. Characterization of transcriptional elements allowed the identification of the promoter in the human RPS19 gene and the localization of a strong regulatory element in the third conserved sequence element. By Northern blot and Western blot analyses of murine splenic erythroblasts infected with the anemia-inducing strain Friend virus (FAV cells), RPS19 mRNA and protein expression were shown to decrease during terminal erythroid differentiation. We anticipate that these findings will contribute to further development of our understanding of the contribution of RPS19 to erythropoiesis.

Ribosomal protein S19 (RPS19) is frequently mutated in Diamond-Blackfan anemia (DBA), a rare congenital hypoplastic anemia. Recent studies have shown that RPS19 expression decreases during terminal erythroid differentiation. Currently no information is available on the subcellular localization of normal RPS19 and the potential effects of various RPS19 mutations on cellular localization. In the present study, using wild-type and mutant RPS19 cDNA, we explored the subcellular distribution of normal and mutant proteins in a fibroblast cell line (Cos-7 cells). RPS19 was detected primarily in the nucleus, and more specifically in the nucleoli, where RPS19 colocalized with the nucleolar protein nucleolin. Using various N-terminal and C-terminal deletion constructs, we identified 2 nucleolar localization signals (NoSs) in RPS19: the first comprising amino acids Met1 to Arg16 in the NH2-terminus and the second comprising Gly120 to Asn142 in the COOH-terminus. Importantly, 2 mutations identified in DBA patients, Val15Phe and Gly127Gln, each of which localized to 1 of the 2 NoS, failed to localize RPS19 to the nucleolus. In addition to their mislocalization, there was a dramatic decrease in the expression of the 2 mutant proteins compared to the wild type. This decrease in protein expression was specific for the mutant RPS19, since expression of other proteins was normal. The present findings enable us to document the nucleolar localization signals in RPS19 and help define the phenotypic consequences of some mutations in RPS19 in DBA.

Diamond-Blackfan anemia (DBA) is a rare congenital disease affecting erythroid precursor differentiation. DBA is emerging as a paradigm for a new class of pathologies potentially linked to disorders in ribosome biogenesis. Three genes encoding ribosomal proteins have been associated to DBA: after RPS19, mutations in genes RPS24 and RPS17 were recently identified in a fraction of the patients. Here, we show that cells from patients carrying mutations in RPS24 have defective pre-rRNA maturation, as in the case of RPS19 mutations. However, in contrast to RPS19 involvement in the maturation of the internal transcribed spacer 1, RPS24 is required for processing of the 5' external transcribed spacer. Remarkably, epistasis experiments with small interfering RNAs indicate that the functions of RPS19 and RPS24 in pre-rRNA processing are connected. Resolution of the crystal structure of RPS24e from the archeon Pyroccocus abyssi reveals domains of RPS24 potentially involved in interactions with pre-ribosomes. Based on these data, we discuss the impact of RPS24 mutations and speculate that RPS19 and RPS24 cooperate at a particular stage of ribosome biogenesis connected to a cell cycle checkpoint, thus affecting differentiation of erythroid precursors as well as developmental processes.

Diamond-Blackfan anemia (DBA) is a congenital red blood cell aplasia that is usually diagnosed during early infancy. Apart from defects in red blood cell maturation, the disorder is also associated with various physical anomalies in 40% of patients. Mutations in the ribosomal protein (RP) S19 are found in 25% of patients, while mutations in other proteins of the small ribosomal subunit--RPS17 and RPS24--have been found in a fraction of patients. Recently, mutations in RPL5, RPL11, and RPL35a of the large ribosomal subunit have also been reported in several DBA patients. Here, we present the identification of mutations in the RPL5 and RPL11 genes in patients from the Czech DBA Registry. Mutations in RPL5 were identified in eight patients from 6 out of 28 families (21.4%), and mutations in RPL11 in two patients from 2 out of 28 families (7.1%). Interestingly, all 10 patients with either an RPL5 or RPL11 mutation exhibited one or more physical anomalies; specifically, thumb anomalies (flat thenar) were always present, while no such anomaly was observed in seven patients with an RPS19 mutation. Moreover, 9 out of 10 patients with either an RPL5 or RPL11 mutation were born small for gestational age (SGA) compared to 3 out of 7 patients from the RPS19-mutated group. These observations may suggest that mutations, at least in RPL5, seem to generally have more profound impact on fetal development than mutations in RPS19. Since RPL5 and RPL11, together with RPL23, are also involved in the MDM2-mediated p53 pathway regulation, we also screened the RPL23 gene for mutations; however, no mutations were identified.

Diamond-Blackfan anemia is a rare, clinically heterogeneous, congenital red cell aplasia: 40% of patients have congenital abnormalities. Recent studies have shown that in western countries, the disease is associated with heterozygous mutations in the ribosomal protein (RP) genes in about 50% of patients. There have been no studies to determine the incidence of these mutations in Asian patients with Diamond-Blackfan anemia. We screened 49 Japanese patients with Diamond-Blackfan anemia (45 probands) for mutations in the six known genes associated with Diamond-Blackfan anemia: RPS19, RPS24, RPS17, RPL5, RPL11, and RPL35A. RPS14 was also examined due to its implied involvement in 5q- syndrome. Mutations in RPS19, RPL5, RPL11 and RPS17 were identified in five, four, two and one of the probands, respectively. In total, 12 (27%) of the Japanese Diamond-Blackfan anemia patients had mutations in ribosomal protein genes. No mutations were detected in RPS14, RPS24 or RPL35A. All patients with RPS19 and RPL5 mutations had physical abnormalities. Remarkably, cleft palate was seen in two patients with RPL5 mutations, and thumb anomalies were seen in six patients with an RPS19 or RPL5 mutation. In contrast, a small-for-date phenotype was seen in five patients without an RPL5 mutation. We observed a slightly lower frequency of mutations in the ribosomal protein genes in patients with Diamond-Blackfan anemia compared to the frequency reported in western countries. Genotype-phenotype data suggest an association between anomalies and RPS19 mutations, and a negative association between small-for-date phenotype and RPL5 mutations.

Mutations in ribosomal proteins RPS19, RPS24 and RPS17 have been reported in Diamond-Blackfan Anemia (DBA), an autosomal dominant disease characterised by pure red cell aplasia. DBA is the prototype of ribosomapathies: a protein synthesis defect in a tissue with a high cellular turnover is considered the cause of the erythroid progenitor failure. We have created the Diamond-Blackfan Anemia mutation database to curate and record DBA gene mutations, together with their functional consequences and clinical phenotypes. This locus-specific resource is open to future submissions and is available online (http://www.dbagenes.unito.it). It is founded on the Leiden Open (source) Variation Database (LOVD) system and includes data from sequence and structure analysis tools, genomic database resources and published reports. It lists all identified variants and background genomic information. Phenotypic data are accessed by selecting a particular mutation. The database includes 219 unique variants of which 86 are disease-causing mutations. The database will be supplemented with other DBA genes as soon as they are reported and their mutations are identified and it should be of assistance to clinicians and investigators involved in DBA research and care.

Diamond-Blackfan anemia (DBA) is a rare congenital red-cell aplasia characterized by anemia, bone-marrow erythroblastopenia, and congenital anomalies and is associated with heterozygous mutations in the ribosomal protein (RP) S19 gene (RPS19) in approximately 25% of probands. We report identification of de novo nonsense and splice-site mutations in another RP, RPS24 (encoded by RPS24 [10q22-q23]) in approximately 2% of RPS19 mutation-negative probands. This finding strongly suggests that DBA is a disorder of ribosome synthesis and that mutations in other RP or associated genes that lead to disrupted ribosomal biogenesis and/or function may also cause DBA.

Mutations in the hematopoietic transcription factor GATA-1 alter the proliferation/differentiation of hemopoietic progenitors. Mutations in exon 2 interfere with the synthesis of the full-length isoform of GATA-1 and lead to the production of a shortened isoform, GATA-1s. These mutations have been found in patients with Diamond-Blackfan anemia (DBA), a congenital erythroid aplasia typically caused by mutations in genes encoding ribosomal proteins. We sequenced GATA-1 in 23 patients that were negative for mutations in the most frequently mutated DBA genes. One patient showed a c.2T > C mutation in the initiation codon leading to the loss of the full-length GATA-1 isoform.

Diamond-Blackfan anemia (DBA) is an inherited bone marrow failure syndrome characterized by anemia, congenital abnormalities, and cancer predisposition. Small ribosomal subunit genes RPS19, RPS24, and RPS17 are mutated in approximately one-third of patients. We used a candidate gene strategy combining high-resolution genomic mapping and gene expression microarray in the analysis of 2 DBA patients with chromosome 3q deletions to identify RPL35A as a potential DBA gene. Sequence analysis of a cohort of DBA probands confirmed involvement RPL35A in DBA. shRNA inhibition shows that Rpl35a is essential for maturation of 28S and 5.8S rRNAs, 60S subunit biogenesis, normal proliferation, and cell survival. Analysis of pre-rRNA processing in primary DBA lymphoblastoid cell lines demonstrated similar alterations of large ribosomal subunit rRNA in both RPL35A-mutated and some RPL35A wild-type patients, suggesting additional large ribosomal subunit gene defects are likely present in some cases of DBA. These data demonstrate that alterations of large ribosomal subunit proteins cause DBA and support the hypothesis that DBA is primarily the result of altered ribosomal function. The results also establish that haploinsufficiency of large ribosomal subunit proteins contributes to bone marrow failure and potentially cancer predisposition.

More than a decade has passed since the initial identification of ribosomal protein gene mutations in patients with Diamond-Blackfan anemia (DBA), a hematologic disorder that became the founding member of a class of diseases known as ribosomopathies. In these diseases, genetic abnormalities that result in defective ribosome biogenesis cause strikingly tissue-specific phenotypes in patients, specifically bone marrow failure, craniofacial abnormalities and skeletal defects. Several animal models and numerous in vitro studies have demonstrated that the p53 pathway is central to the ribosomopathy phenotype. Additionally, there is mounting evidence of a link between the dysregulation of components of the translational machinery and the pathology of various malignancies. The importance of the role of ribosomal dysfunction in the pathogenesis of hematologic disorders is becoming clearer, and elucidation of the underlying mechanisms could have broad implications for both basic cellular biology and clinical intervention strategies.

Within the decade following the demonstration that mutations in the RPS19 gene can lead to Diamond-Blackfan anemia (DBA), this disease has become a paradigm for an emerging group of pathologies linked to defects in ribosome biogenesis. DBA patients exhibit abnormal pre-rRNA maturation patterns and the majority bear mutations in one of several ribosomal protein genes that encode structural components of the ribosome essential for the correct assembly of the ribosomal subunits. Extensive study of the most frequently mutated gene, RPS19, has shown that mutations prevent the assembly of the ribosomal protein into forming pre-ribosomal particles. This defect in ribosome production triggers nucleolar stress pathways, the activation of which appears to be central to pathophysiological mechanisms. Why mutations in ribosomal protein genes so strongly and specifically affect erythropoiesis in DBA remains a challenging question, especially given the fact that defects in genes encoding nonstructural ribosome biogenesis factors have been shown to cause diseases other than DBA. A major problem in understanding the pathophysiological mechanisms in DBA remains the lack of a suitable animal model. Despite this, considerable strides have been made over that past few years demonstrating that several factors involved in the synthesis of ribosomes are targets of disease-causing mutations.

Diamond-Blackfan anemia (DBA) typically presents with red blood cell aplasia that usually manifests in the first year of life. The only gene currently known to be mutated in DBA encodes ribosomal protein S19 (RPS19). Previous studies have shown that the yeast RPS19 protein is required for a specific step in the maturation of 40S ribosomal subunits. Our objective here was to determine whether the human RPS19 protein functions at a similar step in 40S subunit maturation. Studies where RPS19 expression is reduced by siRNA in the hematopoietic cell line, TF-1, show that human RPS19 is also required for a specific step in the maturation of 40S ribosomal subunits. This maturation defect can be monitored by studying rRNA-processing intermediates along the ribosome synthesis pathway. Analysis of these intermediates in CD34- cells from the bone marrow of patients with DBA harboring mutations in RPS19 revealed a pre-rRNA-processing defect similar to that observed in TF-1 cells where RPS19 expression was reduced. This defect was observed to a lesser extent in CD34+ cells from patients with DBA who have mutations in RPS19.

Diamond-Blackfan anemia (DBA), an inherited bone marrow failure syndrome characterized by anemia that usually presents before the first birthday or in early childhood, is associated with birth defects and an increased risk of cancer. Although anemia is the most prominent feature of DBA, the disease is also characterized by growth retardation and congenital malformations, in particular craniofacial, upper limb, heart, and urinary system defects that are present in approximately 30%-50% of patients. DBA has been associated with mutations in seven ribosomal protein (RP) genes, RPS19, RPS24, RPS17, RPL35A, RPL5, RPL11, and RPS7, in about 43% of patients. To continue our large-scale screen of RP genes in a DBA population, we sequenced 35 ribosomal protein genes, RPL15, RPL24, RPL29, RPL32, RPL34, RPL9, RPL37, RPS14, RPS23, RPL10A, RPS10, RPS12, RPS18, RPL30, RPS20, RPL12, RPL7A, RPS6, RPL27A, RPLP2, RPS25, RPS3, RPL41, RPL6, RPLP0, RPS26, RPL21, RPL36AL, RPS29, RPL4, RPLP1, RPL13, RPS15A, RPS2, and RPL38, in our DBA patient cohort of 117 probands. We identified three distinct mutations of RPS10 in five probands and nine distinct mutations of RPS26 in 12 probands. Pre-rRNA analysis in lymphoblastoid cells from patients bearing mutations in RPS10 and RPS26 showed elevated levels of 18S-E pre-rRNA. This accumulation is consistent with the phenotype observed in HeLa cells after knockdown of RPS10 or RPS26 expression with siRNAs, which indicates that mutations in the RPS10 and RPS26 genes in DBA patients affect the function of the proteins in rRNA processing.
