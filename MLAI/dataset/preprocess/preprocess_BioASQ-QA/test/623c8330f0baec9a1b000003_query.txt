What is the association between maternal and fetal alloantigens and RANTES production?

[PMID: 9886550]
Cytokines such as monocyte chemotactic peptide-1 (MCP-1), interleukin-8 (IL-8), RANTES (Regulated on Activation and Normally T-cells Expressed and presumably Secreted) and interleukin-10 (IL-10) are thought to play pivotal roles in immune recognition, acceptance of the fetal allograft, maintenance of pregnancy and parturition. Their secretion and regulation within the third trimester uterus is, however, less well defined. We therefore investigated the release of these cytokines by third trimester amnion, chorion, placenta and decidua, and studied the influence of prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) infusion on their release in a dynamic placental cotyledon perfusion system. MCP-1 was released predominately by the chorion (78.2 +/- 7.3 pg/mg wet tissue weight; mean +/- SEM), decidua (112.4 +/- 5.2 pg/mg) and placenta (101.8 +/- 5.0 pg/mg) with low amounts from the amnion (1.3 +/- 0.4 pg/mg). High concentrations of IL-8 were released by the amnion (39.9 +/- 5.3 pg/mg), chorion (52.8 +/- 1.9 pg/mg), decidua (42.2 +/- 1.5 pg/mg) and placenta (45 +/- 1.3 pg/mg). Release of RANTES was not detectable from the amnion but was detected in moderate amounts from the chorion (6.0 +/- 1.2 pg/mg), decidua (15.2 +/- 1.4 pg/mg) and placenta (26.9 +/- 1.6 pg/mg). Low concentrations of IL-10 were secreted by the chorion (6.8 +/- 0.8 pg/mg), decidua (9.0 +/- 0.9 pg/mg) and placenta (3.3 +/- 0.3 pg/mg) with none detectable from the amnion. MCP-1, IL-8, RANTES and IL-10 were all released by perfused placental cotyledons. PGE2 stimulated release of MCP-1, IL-8 and IL-10 into the maternal and of MCP-1 and IL-8 into the fetal circulation of the placenta but had no effect on RANTES release. It is suggested that MCP-1 and IL-8 may be involved in the inflammatory process of parturition and IL-10 in the protection of the fetal allograft. In addition, PGE2 may have an important immunomodulatory role within the uterus at term.

Previous studies have demonstrated a requirement for RANTES (regulated on activated normal T-cell expressed, and secreted) at immune privileged sites; we have investigated the role of RANTES in the induction of maternal-fetal tolerance. Endometrial and peripheral T lymphocytes were obtained from women with recurrent pregnancy losses (RPLs) and fertile women. RANTES modulation by progesterone or paternal alloantigens was measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay or flow cytometry analysis. Progesterone significantly increased intracellular RANTES expression in CD4+ and CD8+ endometrial T cells. Moreover, alloreactive lymphocytes from RPL patients produced lower RANTES levels when compared with those from fertile women. At the local level, treatment with recombinant RANTES induced a decrease in CCR5 and CXCR4 messenger RNA that correlated with an increase in T-bet expression. RPL patients and normally fertile women express RANTES similarly, but differ in their patterns of RANTES receptor expression. RANTES may be implicated in the local induction of a Th1-type response necessary for successful implantation. Altered response to RANTES stimulation among some RPL patients may be responsible for poor pregnancy outcomes.

Several studies indicate that RANTES (regulated on activation, normal T cell expressed and secreted) is able to downregulate T-cell responses which suggest it might be relevant for fetal tolerance induction. However, the role of RANTES in pregnancy had not been established. Here we investigate RANTES regulation during early pregnancy and potential failures leading to losses of pregnancies. RANTES and progesterone levels were determined in sera and feto-placental units from high resorption rate CBA/JxDBA/2 pregnant females and compared with CBA/JxBALB/c normal pregnant mice. RANTES in vitro modulation was also studied in nulliparous, primiparous and multiparous CBA/J and BALB/c cells in response to paternal alloantigen and progesterone stimulation. Nulliparous CBA/J females were quantitatively deficient in RANTES sera levels, whereas pregnancies with male BALB/c or DBA/2 increased its production. However, feto-placental units from CBA/J females are high producers of progesterone and RANTES. These data suggest that the beneficial effect of RANTES on feto-maternal interface requires an optimal concentration range and might be modulated by progesterone, hence exacerbated placental expression could be associated with high resorption rate.
