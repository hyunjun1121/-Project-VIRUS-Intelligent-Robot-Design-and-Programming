Cardiac toxicity is a major adverse effect caused by doxorubicin (DOX) therapy. Many recent studies have shown that DOX toxicity involves generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS). Although protection or alleviation of DOX toxicity can be achieved by administration of antioxidant vitamins such as ascorbic acid and vitamin E, their cardioprotective effect remains controversial. Thus alternative naturally occurring antioxidants may potentially be candidates for antioxidant therapy. In this study, we investigated the antioxidative and cytoprotective effects of Phyllanthus urinaria (PU) against DOX toxicity using H9c2 cardiac myoblasts. The total antioxidant capacity of PU (1 mg/ml) was 5306.75+/-461.62 FRAP value (microM). DOX IC50 values were used to evaluate the cytoprotective effects of PU ethanolic extract (1 or 10 microg/ml) in comparison with those of ascorbic acid (VIT C, 100 microM) and N-acetylcysteine (NAC, 100 microM). PU treatments (1 or 10 microg/ml) dose dependently caused rightward DOX IC50 shifts of 2.8- and 8.5-fold, respectively while treatments with VIT C and NAC increased DOX IC50 by 3.3- and 4.2-fold, respectively. Additionally, lipid peroxidation and caspase-3 activity were parameters used to evaluate cytoprotective effect. All antioxidants completely inhibited cellular lipid peroxidation and caspase-3 activation induced by DOX (1 microM). Endogenous antioxidant defense such as total glutathione (tGSH), catalase and superoxide dismutase (SOD) activity was also modulated by the antioxidants. PU treatment alone dose dependently increased tGSH, and this effect was retained in the presence of DOX. Similar effect was observed in the assessment of catalase and SOD enzyme activity. The nuclear factor kappaB (NFkappaB) transcription factor assay demonstrated that all antioxidants significantly inhibited DOX-induced NFkappaB activation. Our results suggest that PU protection against DOX cardiotoxicity was mediated through multiple pathways and this plant may serve as an alternative source of antioxidants for prevention of DOX cardiotoxicity.

Doxorubicin (DOX) is a widely used chemotherapy agent. The major adverse effect of DOX treatment in cancer patients is the onset of cardiomyopathy and heart failure. Reactive oxygen species (ROS) are proposed to be responsible for DOX cardiotoxicity. Curcumin, a natural compound extracted from Curcuma Longa L., is known for its anti-oxidant properties. It has been identified as increased apoptosis in several cancer cell lines in combination with doxorubicin, but there are few studies about the effect of curcumin and doxorubicin on normal cardiac cells. Therefore, we evaluated the effects of curcumin on apoptosis induced by DOX in cardiac muscle cells. Pretreatment with curcumin significantly increased DOX-induced apoptosis of cardiac muscle cells through down regulation of Bcl-2, up-regulation of caspase-8 and caspase-9. The Bax/Bcl-2 ratio increased significantly after 1h pretreatment with curcumin. As well, curcumin increases ROS generation by DOX. In response to DOX, NF-κB was activated. However, curcumin was able to inhibit NF-κB activation. In conclusion, our results indicated that pretreatment with nontoxic concentrations of curcumin sensitized H9c2 cells to DOX-mediated apoptosis by generation of ROS.

A Phase II clinical trial of a new anthracycline, (2''R)-4'-0-tetrahydropyranyladriamycin (THP), was performed in 137 patients with urological malignancies. Out of them, 111 patients were evaluated for tumor responses and 125 patients were evaluated for adverse effects. In cases of intravenous administration, overall response rate was 18.5% (22.2% for bladder cancer, 30.0% for tumors of the renal pelvis and ureter, and 6.7% for prostatic cancer). In the case of intra-arterial administration, overall response rate was 42.9% (50.0% for bladder cancer). For 50 patients with superficial bladder cancer intravesical chemotherapy with THP was performed. Sixteen patients showed complete disappearance of the tumor, 2 patients showed more than 90% tumor regression and 12 patients showed more than 50% tumor regression, respectively. Overall response rate was 60%. Cardiotoxicity was minimal. Alopecia was noted in a total of 16 patients, but this was minimal. Leukocytopenia was the major adverse effect among patients undergoing systemic THP administration. In conclusion, THP was most effective against transitional cell carcinoma of the urinary tract.

The anthracycline glycoside antibiotics represent a group of potent anticancer agents with a wide spectrum of activity against solid tumours and haematological malignancies, and are the mainstay of a large number of clinical protocols for the treatment of adult and childhood neoplastic diseases. Their clinical activity is limited, however, by acute and chronic adverse effects. Myelosuppression, predominantly neutropenia and leucopenia, is the dose-limiting toxicity; in addition to this, mucositis, nausea, vomiting and alopecia are frequent, whereas hepatopathy, characterised by elevated bilirubin concentrations, occurs less frequently. Cardiotoxicity is a major adverse effect of the anthracycline antibiotics and can be acute or chronic; in the acute setting, electrocardiographic abnormalities may be seen, including ST-T elevations and arrhythmias, but chronic cardiotoxicity represents a serious adverse effect that may be lethal due to the development of irreversible, cumulative dose-dependent, congestive cardiomyopathy. The occurrence of toxicity displays a marked interindividual variation, and for this reason the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of anthracyclines have been extensively investigated in order to identify integrated models that can be used in the clinical setting to prevent the development of serious toxicity, mainly leucopenia, and maximise tumour exposure. Pharmacokinetics has been recognised to influence both the toxicity and the activity of anthracyclines; in particular, there is increasing evidence that the mode of administration plays an important role for cumulative cardiotoxicity and data indicate that bolus administration, rather than continuous infusion, appears to be an important risk factor for anthracycline-induced cardiomyopathy, thus implying that this type of toxicity is maximum concentration-dependent. On the contrary, exposure to the drug, as measured by area under the curve, seems best related to the occurrence of leucopenia. Finally, the development of pharmacokinetic-pharmacodynamic models allows the simulation of drug effects and ultimately dose optimisation in order to anticipate important toxicities and prevent their occurrence by the administration of prophylactic treatments.

A pilot trial of combined chemotherapy with paclitaxel, doxorubicin and cisplatin was conducted in patients with advanced endometrial cancer. Between June 2000 and March 2002 8 patients were treated with combined chemotherapy, consisting of paclitaxel, 135 mg/m2; doxorubicin, 30 mg/m2; and cisplatin, 50 mg/m2 (TAP therapy). Patients received 3 to 5 courses of TAP therapy every 4 weeks. The major adverse effect was myelosuppression. All patients had grade 3 or 4 neutropenia, but did not have any severe infection with uncontrollable fever. Only 1 patient discontinued additional therapy due to grade 3 thrombocytopenia after 3 cycles. Grade 2 neurotoxicity occurred in 5 patients, but grade 3 was not observed. Among 5 patients with measurable tumors, 4 achieved partial response and 1 had no change of tumor size, indicating a response rate of 80.0%. We found that TAP therapy was feasible with G-CSF support and shows potential for high efficacy in advanced endometrial cancer.

A phase II multicenter clinical study of epirubicin, a new anthracycline anticancer agent, was carried out in 46 patients with advanced breast cancer. The treatment schedule consisted of either 60 mg/m2 every three weeks or 40 to 50 mg/m2 on day 1 and day 8 every four weeks. Objective responses were observed in 23.7% of 38 evaluable patients (1 CR and 8 PR). Response rates according to previous chemotherapy were 50.0% (4/8) in previously non-treated patients and 36.4% (4/11) in patients previously treated with non-anthracyclines. The major adverse effect was bone-marrow suppression; leukopenia was observed in 82.1% of patients, anemia in 53.8% and thrombocytopenia in 20.0%. Other toxicities frequently observed were anorexia (55.0%), nausea-vomiting (55.0%) and alopecia (66.7%), but these seemed to be milder than those produced by doxorubicin.

A new anthracycline analog, epirubicin (4'-epi-Adriamycin) was evaluated at eleven institutes in a phase II clinical study in patients with malignant lymphoma. Epirubicin was administered intravenously mainly with using the following two regimens; 50 to 60 mg/m2 every three weeks and 40 mg/m2 weekly. A total of 46 cases were entered into the study and 41 cases were evaluable. Clinical responses, complete plus partial remissions, were observed in 27 cases (65.9%) with 8 of these showing complete remission. There was no significant difference of response between the two regimens. Response rates taking into account previous chemotherapy were 90.9% (10/11) in previously nontreated cases, 61.9% (8/13) in cases previously treated with non-anthracyclines and 52.9% (9/17) in cases treated with anthracyclines. The major adverse effect was bone marrow suppression; leukopenia was observed in 83.8%, anemia in 60.5% and thrombocytopenia in 15.4%. Other adverse effects frequently observed were anorexia (59.0%), nausea-vomiting (48.8%) and alopecia (55.6%). These adverse effects seemed milder than those produced by doxorubicin. The results indicated that epirubicin seemed to be a markedly useful drug against malignant lymphoma.

Doxorubicin is a potent cytostatic drug which is applied for the treatment of various kinds of malignant diseases. In spite of the routine use of this drug its major adverse effect, the dose-dependent cardiotoxicity, cannot be prevented yet. However, several clinical trials indicated that iron chelators are able to moderate the noxious effect more efficiently than radical scavenging antioxidants. This in turn supports the idea that doxorubicin-iron complexes are involved in triggering the cardiotoxicity of this drug by catalyzing the formation of oxygen radicals. However, both the mode of generation of doxorubicin-iron complexes and the consequences in vivo are not understood so far. In order to figure out whether or not doxorubicin can utilize iron from the transport protein transferrin for complex formation and prooxidative activities we studied the redox state of iron and its regulatory control by ceruloplasmin and ascorbate in the plasma of dogs suffering from malignant lymphoma by electron spin resonance spectroscopy. The respective electron spin resonance intensities prior to and after treatment with doxorubicin were compared with those from healthy controls. Our results revealed that dogs with lymphoma exhibit lower levels of paramagnetic copper in ceruloplasmin (-22%) and iron in transferrin (-33%) than healthy animals. Likewise the concentration of ascorbate radicals was lower in patients with lymphoma than in healthy subjects. The decreased cupric state of ceruloplasmin is equivalent to a diminished ferroxidase activity in plasma and therefore indicates indirectly an impaired antioxidant activity in these patients. Administration of doxorubicin in vivo further reduced the concentration of paramagnetic copper (-18%) and iron (-13%) while the concentration of ascorbate radicals remained unchanged. This decrease was also seen during the in vitro incubation of plasma with doxorubicin suggesting a direct interaction of the drug with the paramagnetic metal species. Model experiments revealed that the effect is based on a doxorubicin-induced release of iron from transferrin which is enhanced by ascorbate and the subsequent formation of doxorubicin-iron complexes. This mechanism was shown to trigger the formation of hydroxyl radicals from H(2)O(2) and to cause an oxidation of the antioxidant ceruloplasmin. Our data demonstrate that cardiotoxic doxorubicin-iron complexes are not only formed in cardiomyocytes itself as generally assumed, but are also present in the circulation. Therefore, these findings provide an additional rationale for potential benefit of iron chelators during doxorubicin chemotherapy.

Adriamycin, a lipid-interacting anti-cancer agent, was found to inhibit phospholipid-sensitive Ca2+-dependent phosphorylation of endogenous proteins from the cytosol of the guinea-pig heart. The drug, unexpectedly, also inhibited phosphorylation of separate endogenous proteins in the cardiac cytosol and membranes catalysed by the calmodulin-sensitive species of Ca2+-dependent protein kinase. In both phosphorylation systems, the inhibition by adriamycin was reversed by either phospholipid (phosphatidylserine or cardiolipin) or calmodulin respectively. Adriamycin also inhibited phosphorylation of histone (exogenous protein) catalysed by purified cardiac phospholipid-sensitive Ca2+-dependent protein kinase, but not that by cyclic AMP-dependent and cyclic GMP-dependent protein kinases. It appears that Ca2+-dependent protein phosphorylation systems, regulated either by phospholipid or calmodulin, may represent hitherto unrecognized sites of action of adriamycin. It remains to be seen whether inhibition by adriamycin of these systems is related to the severe cardiotoxicity, the major adverse effect of the drug that limits its clinical usefulness.
