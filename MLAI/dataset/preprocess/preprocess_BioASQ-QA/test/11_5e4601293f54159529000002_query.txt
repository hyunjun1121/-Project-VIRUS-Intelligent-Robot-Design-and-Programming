Central Vein Sign is characteristic to which disease?

[PMID: 28820013]
Detection of a "central vein sign" (CVS) on FLAIR* magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is highly specific and sensitive for multiple sclerosis (MS). We evaluated the specificity and sensitivity of simplified CVS algorithms for MS diagnosis. MRIs from 10 participants with MS without additional comorbidities for MRI white matter abnormalities; 10 with MS and additional comorbidities for white matter abnormalities; 10 with migraine, white matter abnormalities, and no additional comorbidities; and 10 who had previously been erroneously diagnosed with MS were evaluated. 3T MRI T2-FLAIR and T2*-weighted sequences were acquired to create FLAIR* images. Three MS physician reviewers, blinded to diagnosis, evaluated two different algorithms: (1) three lesions pre-selected on FLAIR were subsequently evaluated for CVS on FLAIR*( select3). (2) FLAIR* was evaluated for up to three lesions with CVS ( select3*). For select3, average specificity across reviewers for MS was 0.98 and sensitivity 0.52 and a correct prediction of diagnosis demonstrated kappa = 0.29. For select3*, specificity was 0.81, sensitivity was 0.83, and kappa was 0.31. A simplified determination of CVS in three white matter lesions on 3T FLAIR* MRI demonstrated good specificity and sensitivity and fair inter-rater reliability for a diagnosis of MS and with further study, may be a candidate for clinical application.

We aimed to evaluate the pooled incidence of central vein sign on T2*-weighted images from patients with multiple sclerosis (MS), and to determine the diagnostic performance of this central vein sign for differentiating MS from other white matter lesions and provide an optimal cut-off value. A computerized systematic search of the literature in PUBMED and EMBASE was conducted up to December 14, 2018. Original articles investigating central vein sign on T2*-weighted images of patients with MS were selected. The pooled incidence was obtained using random-effects model. The pooled sensitivity and specificity were obtained using a bivariate random-effects model. An optimal cut-off value for the proportion of lesions with a central vein sign was calculated from those studies providing individual patient data. Twenty-one eligible articles covering 501 patients with MS were included. The pooled incidence of central vein sign at the level of individual lesion in patients with MS was 74% (95% CI, 65-82%). The pooled sensitivity and pooled specificity for the diagnostic performance of the central vein sign were 98% (95% CI, 92-100%) and 97% (95% CI, 91-99%), respectively. The area under the HSROC curve was 1.00 (95% CI, 0.99-1.00). The optimal cut-off value for the proportion of lesions with a central vein sign was found to be 45%. Although various T2*-weighted images have been used across studies, the current evidence supports the use of the central vein sign on T2*-weighted images to differentiate MS from other white matter lesions.

The central vein sign is a promising MR imaging diagnostic biomarker for multiple sclerosis. Recent studies have demonstrated that patients with MS have higher proportions of white matter lesions with the central vein sign compared with those with diseases that mimic MS on MR imaging. However, the clinical application of the central vein sign as a biomarker is limited by interrater differences in the adjudication of the central vein sign as well as the time burden required for the determination of the central vein sign for each lesion in a patient's full MR imaging scan. In this study, we present an automated technique for the detection of the central vein sign in white matter lesions. Using multimodal MR imaging, the proposed method derives a central vein sign probability, π<sub>ij</sub>, for each lesion, as well as a patient-level central vein sign biomarker, ψ<sub>i</sub>. The method is probabilistic in nature, allows site-specific lesion segmentation methods, and is potentially robust to intersite variability. The proposed algorithm was tested on imaging acquired at the University of Vermont in 16 participants who have MS and 15 participants who do not. By means of the proposed automated technique, participants with MS were found to have significantly higher values of ψ than those without MS (ψ<sub>MS</sub> = 0.55 ± 0.18; ψ<sub>non-MS</sub> = 0.31 ± 0.12; <i>P</i> < .001). The algorithm was also found to show strong discriminative ability between patients with and without MS, with an area under the curve of 0.88. The current study presents the first fully automated method for detecting the central vein sign in white matter lesions and demonstrates promising performance in a sample of patients with and without MS.

Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is of paramount importance for the early diagnosis of multiple sclerosis (MS) and MRI findings are part of the MS diagnostic criteria. There is a growing interest in the use of ultra-high-field strength -7 Tesla- (7T) MRI to investigate, in vivo, the pathological substrate of the disease. Areas covered: An overview of 7T MRI applications in MS focusing on increased sensitivity for lesion detection, specificity of the central vein sign and better understanding of MS pathophysiology. Implications for disease diagnosis, monitoring and treatment planning are discussed. Expert commentary: 7T MRI provides increased signal-to-noise and contrast-to-noise-ratio that allow higher spatial resolution and better detection of anatomical and pathological features. The high spatial resolution reachable at 7T has been a game changer for neuroimaging applications not only in MS but also in epilepsy, brain tumors, dementia, and neuro-psychiatric disorders. Furthermore, the first 7T device has recently been cleared for clinical use by the food and drug administration.

In multiple sclerosis (MS), magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is a sensitive tool for detecting white matter lesions, but its diagnostic specificity is still suboptimal; ambiguous cases are frequent in clinical practice. Detection of perivenular lesions in the brain (the "central vein sign") improves the pathological specificity of MS diagnosis, but comprehensive evaluation of this MRI biomarker in MS-mimicking inflammatory and/or autoimmune diseases, such as central nervous system (CNS) inflammatory vasculopathies, is lacking. In a multicenter study, we assessed the frequency of perivenular lesions in MS versus systemic autoimmune diseases with CNS involvement and primary angiitis of the CNS (PACNS). In 31 patients with inflammatory CNS vasculopathies and 52 with relapsing-remitting MS, 3-dimensional T2*-weighted and T2-fluid-attenuated inversion recovery images were obtained during a single MRI acquisition after gadolinium injection. For each lesion, the central vein sign was evaluated according to consensus guidelines. For each patient, lesion count, volume, and brain location, as well as fulfillment of dissemination in space MRI criteria, were assessed. MS showed higher frequency of perivenular lesions (median = 88%) than did inflammatory CNS vasculopathies (14%), without overlap between groups or differences between 3T and 1.5T MRI. Among inflammatory vasculopathies, Behçet disease showed the highest median frequency of perivenular lesions (34%), followed by PACNS (14%), antiphospholipid syndromes (12%), Sjögren syndrome (11%), and systemic lupus erythematosus (0%). When a threshold of 50% perivenular lesions was applied, central vein sign discriminated MS from inflammatory vasculopathies with a diagnostic accuracy of 100%. The central vein sign differentiates inflammatory CNS vasculopathies from MS at standard clinical magnetic field strengths. Ann Neurol 2018;83:283-294.

Purpose The aim of this study was to determine the occurrence and distribution of the 'central vein' sign in white matter lesions on susceptibility-weighted magnetic resonance images in patients with multiple sclerosis (MS) and cerebral small vessel disease (CSVD). Materials and methods T2-weighted and fluid-attenuated inversion recovery magnetic resonance images of 19 MS patients and 19 patients affected by CSVD were analysed for the presence and localisation of focal hyperintense white matter lesions. Lesions were subdivided into periventricular or non-periventricular (juxtacortical, subcortical, deep white matter and cerebellar) distributed. The number and localisation of lesions presenting with the central vein sign were recorded and compared between MS and CSVD lesions. Results A total of 313 MS patients and 75 CSVD lesions were identified on T2-weighted and fluid-attenuated inversion recovery magnetic resonance images. The central vein sign was found in 128 MS lesions (40.9%), and the majority of them (71/128, 55.5%) had a periventricular distribution. The central vein sign was found in 22 out of 75 (29.3%) CSVD lesions, and periventricular distribution was seen in six out of 22 (27.2%) CSVD lesions. The difference in the proportion of white matter hyperintense lesions that presented with the central vein sign on susceptibility-weighted images in patients with MS and CSVD was statistically different, and a significantly higher number of MS patients presented with lesions with the central vein sign compared to CSVD patients. Conclusion The presence of the central vein sign on susceptibility-weighted images for MS lesions improves the understanding of the periventricular distribution of MS lesions and could contribute as adjunctive diagnostic criteria for MS disease.

Previous T2*-weighted magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) studies have used white matter lesion (WML) central veins to distinguish multiple sclerosis (MS) from its mimics. To be clinically applicable, the "central vein sign" needs to be detectable across different T2* sequences. Our objective was to determine if the central vein sign is reliably present in MS and absent in patients with ischemic small vessel disease (SVD) across different T2* sequences at 3T MRI. Ten patients with MS and 10 with SVD were each scanned on a 3 T Philips and GE scanner. The MRI protocol included 3-dimensional (3D) T2* GRE, T2* with high echo planar imaging (EPI) factor and susceptibility-weighted angiography (SWAN). Total WML numbers, central vein numbers, and proportion of WMLs with central veins were calculated using each sequence. Three blinded raters identified a subset of six WMLs with central veins to diagnose MS or SVD. Irrespective of the sequence, MS patients were identified based on a higher proportion of WMLs with central veins. This proportion was dependent on the T2* sequence used. T2* with high EPI allowed the highest median proportion (69.6%) in MS patients; 6.1% in SVD patients (P < .0004). Rater reproducibility varied depending on the T2* sequence used. T2* with high EPI produced good agreement with the clinical diagnosis (Cohen's kappa range; .78-.89), as did SWAN imaging with some raters; ĸ = .69. The central vein sign can diagnose MS in the clinical setting of modern 3T scanners. However, variations in the T2* sequences need to be considered when defining a threshold for diagnosis.

Over the past few years, MRI has become an indispensable tool for diagnosing multiple sclerosis (MS). However, the current MRI criteria for MS diagnosis have imperfect sensitivity and specificity. The central vein sign (CVS) has recently been proposed as a novel MRI biomarker to improve the accuracy and speed of MS diagnosis. Evidence indicates that the presence of the CVS in individual lesions can accurately differentiate MS from other diseases that mimic this condition. However, the predictive value of the CVS for the development of clinical MS in patients with suspected demyelinating disease is still unknown. Moreover, the lack of standardization for the definition and imaging of the CVS currently limits its clinical implementation and validation. On the basis of a thorough review of the existing literature on the CVS and the consensus opinion of the members of the North American Imaging in Multiple Sclerosis (NAIMS) Cooperative, this article provides statements and recommendations aimed at helping radiologists and neurologists to better understand, refine, standardize and evaluate the CVS in the diagnosis of MS.

The central vein sign has been proposed as a specific imaging biomarker for distinguishing between multiple sclerosis (MS) and not MS, mainly based on findings from ultrahigh-field magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) studies. The diagnostic value of the central vein sign in a multicenter setting with a variety of clinical 3 tesla (T) MRI protocols, however, remains unknown. To evaluate the sensitivity and specificity of various central vein sign lesion criteria for differentiating MS from non-MS conditions using 3T brain MRI with various commonly used pulse sequences. This large multicenter, cross-sectional study enrolled participants (n = 648) of ongoing observational studies and patients included in neuroimaging research databases of 8 neuroimaging centers in Europe. Patient enrollment and MRI data collection were performed between January 1, 2010, and November 30, 2016. Data analysis was conducted between January 1, 2016, and April 30, 2018. Investigators were blinded to participant diagnosis by a novel blinding procedure. Occurrence of central vein sign was detected on 3T T2*-weighted or susceptibility-weighted imaging. Sensitivity and specificity were assessed for these MRI sequences and for different central vein sign lesion criteria, which were defined by the proportion of lesions with central vein sign or by absolute numbers of lesions with central vein sign. A total of 606 participants were included in the study after exclusion of 42 participants. Among the 606 participants, 413 (68.2%) were women. Patients with clinically isolated syndrome and relapsing-remitting MS (RRMS) included 235 women (66.6%) and had a median (range) age of 37 (14.7-61.4) years, a median (range) disease duration of 2 (0-33) years, and a median (range) Expanded Disability Status Scale score of 1.5 (0-6.5). Patients without MS included 178 women (70.4%) and had a median (range) age of 54 (18-83) years. A total of 4447 lesions were analyzed in a total of 487 patients: 690 lesions in 98 participants with clinically isolated syndrome, 2815 lesions in 225 participants with RRMS, 54 lesions in 13 participants with neuromyelitis optica spectrum disorder, 54 lesions in 14 participants with systemic lupus erythematosus, 121 lesions in 29 participants with migraine or cluster headache, 240 lesions in 20 participants with diabetes, and 473 lesions in 88 participants with other types of small-vessel disease. The sensitivity was 68.1% and specificity was 82.9% for distinguishing MS from not MS using a 35% central vein sign proportion threshold. The 3 central vein sign lesion criteria had a sensitivity of 61.9% and specificity of 89.0%. Sensitivity was higher when an optimized T2*-weighted sequence was used. In this study, use of the central vein sign at 3T MRI yielded a high specificity and a moderate sensitivity in differentiating MS from not MS; international, multicenter studies may be needed to ascertain whether the central vein sign-based criteria can accurately detect MS.

To assess the value of the central vein sign (CVS) on a clinical 3T scanner to distinguish between multiple sclerosis (MS) and neuromyelitis optica spectrum disorder (NMOSD). Eighteen aquaporin-4-antibody-positive patients with NMOSD, 18 patients with relapsing-remitting MS, and 25 healthy controls underwent 3T MRI. The presence of a central vein in white matter lesions on susceptibility-weighted imaging, defined as a thin hypointense line or a small dot, was recorded. The proportion of lesions with the CVS was higher in MS than NMOSD (80% vs 32%, <i>p</i> < 0.001). A greater proportion of lesions with the CVS predicted the diagnosis of MS, rather than NMOSD (odds ratio 1.10, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.04 to 1.16, <i>p</i> = 0.001), suggesting that each percent unit increase in the proportion of lesions with the CVS in an individual patient was associated with a 10% increase in the risk of the same patient having MS. If more than 54% of the lesions on any given scan show the CVS, then the patient can be given a diagnosis of MS with an accuracy of 94% (95% CIs 81.34, 99.32, <i>p</i> < 0.001, sensitivity/specificity 90%/100%). The clinical value of the CVS in the context of the differential diagnosis between MS and NMOSD, previously suggested using 7T scanners, is now extended to clinical 3T scanners, thereby making a step towards the use of CVS in clinical practice. This study provides Class III evidence that the CVS on 3T MRI accurately distinguishes patients with MS from those with seropositive NMOSD.

Misdiagnosis is common in multiple sclerosis (MS) as a proportion of patients present with atypical clinical/magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) findings. The central vein sign has the potential to be a non-invasive, MS-specific biomarker. To test the accuracy of the central vein sign in predicting a diagnosis of MS in patients with diagnostic uncertainty at disease presentation using T2*-weighted, 3 T MRI. In this prospective pilot study, we recruited individuals with symptoms unusual for MS but with brain MRI consistent with the disease, and those with a typical clinical presentation of MS whose MRI did not suggest MS. We calculated the proportion of lesions with central veins for each patient and compared the results to the eventual clinical diagnoses. The optimal central vein threshold for diagnosis was established. Thirty-eight patients were scanned, 35 of whom have received a clinical diagnosis. Median percentage of lesions with central veins was 51% in MS and 28% in non-MS. A threshold of 40.7% lesions with central veins resulted in 100% sensitivity and 73.9% specificity. The central vein sign assessed with a clinically available T2* scan can successfully diagnose MS in cases of diagnostic uncertainty. The central vein sign should be considered as a diagnostic biomarker in MS.
