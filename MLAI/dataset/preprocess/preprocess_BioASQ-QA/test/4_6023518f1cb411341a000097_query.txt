Systemic oral phosphodiesterase type 4 (PDE-4) inhibitors have been effective in the treatment of psoriasis. Roflumilast cream contains a PDE-4 inhibitor that is being investigated for the topical treatment of psoriasis. In this phase 2b, double-blind trial, we randomly assigned adults with plaque psoriasis in a 1:1:1 ratio to use roflumilast 0.3% cream, roflumilast 0.15% cream, or vehicle (placebo) cream once daily for 12 weeks. The primary efficacy outcome was the investigator's global assessment (IGA) of a status of clear or almost clear at week 6 (assessed on a 5-point scale of plaque thickening, scaling, and erythema; a score of 0 indicates clear, 1 almost clear, and 4 severe). Secondary outcomes included an IGA score indicating clear or almost clear plus a 2-grade improvement in the IGA score for the intertriginous area and the change in the Psoriasis Area and Severity Index (PASI) score (range, 0 to 72, with higher scores indicating worse disease). Safety was also assessed. Among 331 patients who underwent randomization, 109 were assigned to roflumilast 0.3% cream, 113 to roflumilast 0.15% cream, and 109 to vehicle cream. An IGA score indicating clear or almost clear at week 6 was observed in 28% of the patients in the roflumilast 0.3% group, in 23% in the roflumilast 0.15% group, and in 8% in the vehicle group (P<0.001 and P = 0.004 vs. vehicle for roflumilast 0.3% and 0.15%, respectively). Among the approximately 15% of patients overall who had baseline intertriginous psoriasis of at least mild severity, an IGA score at week 6 indicating clear or almost clear plus a 2-grade improvement in the intertriginous-area IGA score occurred in 73% of the patients in the roflumilast 0.3% group, 44% of those in the roflumilast 0.15% group, and 29% of those in the vehicle group. The mean baseline PASI scores were 7.7 in the roflumilast 0.3% group, 8.0 in the roflumilast 0.15% group, and 7.6 in the vehicle group; the mean change from baseline at week 6 was -50.0%, -49.0%, and -17.8%, respectively. Application-site reactions occurred with similar frequency in the roflumilast groups and the vehicle group. Roflumilast cream administered once daily to affected areas of psoriasis was superior to vehicle cream in leading to a state of clear or almost clear at 6 weeks. Longer and larger trials are needed to determine the durability and safety of roflumilast in psoriasis. (Funded by Arcutis Biotherapeutics; ARQ-151 201 ClinicalTrials.gov number, NCT03638258.).

Oral phosphodiesterase (PDE)4 inhibitors have shown efficacy in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and psoriasis. To assess the effectiveness, local safety and tolerability, and systemic pharmacokinetics of two topical PDE4 inhibitors, roflumilast and TAK-084, in plaque psoriasis. An intraindividual comparison of six topical products was made in 15 patients aged 18-65 years with stable chronic plaque psoriasis in an investigator-blinded, within-subject randomized study. The products evaluated were calcipotriol 0·005% cream; betamethasone valerate 0·1% (both in their marketed formulations); investigational cream formulations of roflumilast 0·5% and TAK-084 0·5% and 5%; and a vehicle cream formulation as a control. Each treatment was applied daily to different test sites located on psoriasis plaques for 3 weeks. The primary end point of (mean) change from baseline in skin infiltrate thickness after 3 weeks of treatment showed statistically significant improvements for all treatments: betamethasone valerate cream (-286·9 μm), the selective PDE4 inhibitors roflumilast 0·5% (-237·1 μm) and TAK-084 (0·5% cream, -153·6 μm; 5% cream, -216·7 μm) and calcipotriol 0·005% (-187·7 μm) when compared with vehicle cream control (all P < 0·001). Both the TAK-084 5% and roflumilast 0·5% formulations performed well overall compared with the potent corticosteroid, betamethasone, and were ranked better than the vitamin D analogue calcipotriol. All adverse events were mild or moderate and none was serious. Topical treatment with cream formulations of the PDE4 inhibitors roflumilast and TAK-084 reduced inflammation, measured as a change in skin infiltrate thickness, and reduced psoriasis severity. Corticosteroid treatments have known systemic and cutaneous side-effects; PDE4 inhibitors could offer an alternative to these and deserve further study.

Background: Roflumilast cream (ARQ-151) is a highly potent, selective phosphodiesterase-4 inhibitor in development for once-daily topical treatment of chronic plaque psoriasis. Objectives: To assess the safety and efficacy of once-daily roflumilast cream 0.5% and 0.15% in patients with chronic plaque psoriasis. Methods: This phase 1/2a study enrolled a single-dose, open-label cohort (Cohort 1: 0.5% cream applied to 25 cm² psoriatic plaques), and a 28-day, double-blinded cohort (Cohort 2: 1:1:1 randomization to roflumilast cream 0.5%, 0.15%, or vehicle). Patients had chronic plaque psoriasis of >6 months' duration with ≤5% body surface area involvement. Outcomes included safety (adverse events) and efficacy (percentage change in the Target Plaque Severity Score [TPSS] × Target Plaque Area [TPA]) at week 4. Results: For Cohorts 1 (n=8) and 2 (n=89), adverse events (all mild/moderate; none severe or serious) were similar between active arms and vehicle. Treatment-related events were confined to the application site, without differences between drug and vehicle. No patient discontinued treatment due to adverse events. The primary efficacy endpoint was met for both roflumilast cream doses: TPSS×TPA improvement at week 4 was statistically significant for roflumilast 0.5% (P=0.0007) and 0.15% (P=0.0011) versus vehicle; significance was reached as early as 2 weeks. For both roflumilast cream doses, 66%-67% improvement from baseline was observed at week 4, without reaching a plateau, versus 38% improvement for vehicle. Conclusion: Roflumilast cream was safe and highly effective at doses of 0.5% and 0.15% and represents a potential novel once-daily topical therapy for the treatment of chronic plaque psoriasis.
