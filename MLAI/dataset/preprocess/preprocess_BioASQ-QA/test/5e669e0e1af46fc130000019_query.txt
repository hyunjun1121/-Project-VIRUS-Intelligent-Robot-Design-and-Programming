What is the chromosomal abnormality associated with Klinefelter Syndrome

[PMID: 14018845]
When human chromosome anomalies were first described in 1959, it appeared that specific abnormalities might be correlated with specific syndromes. Mongolism and the D and E syndromes are examples of specific syndromes associated with the presence of an extra autosome. Klinefelter's syndrome may be associated with a variety of different sex chromosome anomalies including XXY, XXYY, XXXY and XXXXY. The lastnamed variant is the only one that frequently presents features distinguishing it from the others. An XO sex chromosome complex is found in many women with gonadal dysgenesis. However, a variety of mosaicisms have been described in association with this condition, including XO/XX, XO/XXX, XO/XX/XXX, XO/XY and XO/XYY. Extra X chromosomes in phenotypical females do not seem to impair fertility or be consistently associated with congenital anomalies. Two families are described in which chromosome anomalies were found, but the association with defects was irregular. In one family the abnormality involved one of the number 16 chromosomes and in the other it involved one of the small acrocentric chromosomes.

Tetrasomy 9p is a rare clinical syndrome and about 30% of known cases exhibit chromosome mosaicism. The cases with tetrasomy 9p mosaicism have been reported to show the various phenotypes. On the other hand, Klinefelter syndrome is well recognized chromosomal abnormality caused by an additional X chromosome in males (47,XXY), and the characteristic clinical findings include tall stature, immaturity of external genitalia, testicular dysfunction. Here, we report a 10-year-old male with tetrasomy of 9p mosaicism, whose phenotypic feature is mimicking Klinefelter syndrome. He was referred to our hospital for inconspicuous penis. He showed tall height (+2.5 SD). Endocrinological examination revealed the poor testosterone response to human chorionic gonadotropin administration, which indicated the testicular hypofunction, whereas MRI revealed concealed penis as a cause of inconspicuous penis. Because of the phenotype mimicking Klinefelter syndrome, karyotype of his blood lymphocytes was analyzed, and an additional marker chromosome was detected in 6% of the investigated metaphases. Fluorescence in situ hybridization analysis revealed that the marker chromosome was an isochromosome 9p, which resulted in tetrasomy 9p. Chromosome analysis of buccal smear also showed mosaicism for two karyotypes: 5% of cells had the isochromosome of 9p, and the other cells showed normal. This case is the second case with tetrasomy 9p mosaicism mimicking Klinefelter syndrome phenotype in the world. Our case, together with previously reported cases with the same association, indicates the possibility of testicular hypofunction and urogenital anomalies induced by overexpression of some genes on chromosome 9p.

The causes of male infertility are heterogeneous but more than 50% of cases have a genetic basis. Specific genetic defects have been identified in less than 20% of infertile males and, thus, most causes remain to be elucidated. The most common cytogenetic defects associated with nonobstructive azoospermia are numerical and structural chromosome abnormalities, including Klinefelter syndrome (47,XXY) and Y chromosome microdeletions. To refine the incidence and nature of chromosomal aberrations in males with infertility we reviewed cytogenetic results in 668 infertile men with oligozoospermia and azoospermia. High resolution Giemsa banding chromosome analysis and/or fluorescence in situ hybridization were done in 668 infertile males referred for routine cytogenetic analysis between January 2004 and March 2009. The overall incidence of chromosomal abnormalities was about 8.2%. Of the 55 patients with abnormal cytogenetic findings sex chromosome aneuploidies were observed in 29 (53%), including Klinefelter syndrome in 27 (49%). Structural chromosome abnormalities involving autosomes (29%) and sex chromosomes (18%) were detected in 26 infertile men. Abnormal cytogenetic findings were observed in 35 of 264 patients (13.3%) with azoospermia and 19 of 365 (5.2%) with oligozoospermia. Structural chromosomal defects and low level sex chromosome mosaicism are common in oligozoospermia cases. Extensive cytogenetic assessment and fluorescence in situ hybridization may improve the detection rate in males with oligozoospermia. These findings highlight the need for efficient genetic testing in infertile men so that couples may make informed decisions on assisted reproductive technologies to achieve parenthood.

A case of Klinefelter's syndrome with the development of a mediastinal teratocarcinoma is reported suggesting that the association of a gonadotropin-secreting tumor with the XXY chromosomal abnormality may be more than coincidental. Whereas this child appeared to survive the effects of the teratocarcinoma, he succumbed to acute leukemia two years later. This prompted a review of secondary leukemias in children following chemotherapy/radiotherapy for another primary malignancy. These patients responded poorly to treatment of the secondary leukemia with a median survival of about four months. The incidence of secondary leukemias might be expected to be on the rise as increasing numbers of pediatric cancer patients are surviving longer after treatment with agents that are potentially leukemogenic or carcinogenic themselves. Children who have survived cancer and its therapy present special problems and it will be necessary for the pediatrician and practitioner to monitor these children.

Klinefelter syndrome (KS) is a chromosome abnormality characterized by a 47, XXY karyotype associated with hypogonadism and infertility. We present two cases of leukemia in patients with KS. The first patient presented with acute promyelocytic leukemia. He relapsed after the end of treatment. The second patient was diagnosed with chronic myeloid leukemia. Treatment with imatinib failed and the patient presented with myeloid blast crisis.

Klinefelter syndrome is the most commonly diagnosed sex chromosome disorder among males. It is usually associated with 47 chromosomes, including two Xs and one Y. The formal cytogenetic designation for Klinefelter syndrome is 47, XXY; the extra sex chromosome is due to meiotic chromosomal nondisjunction. Increased risk of various malignant diseases has been recognized among patients with different congenital chromosomal abnormalities. Since the early 1960s, numerous reports have appeared of an increased risk of malignant neoplasms among patients with Klinefelter syndrome. Evidence suggests a correlation with increased incidences of germ cell tumors and breast cancers. Whether these patients are at an increased risk of hematologic malignant disease, especially acute leukemia, is still uncertain. This report describes a patient with agnogenic myeloid metaplasia and Klinefelter syndrome, an association not previously reported.

47,XXY (KS) occurs in 1:650 male births, though less than 25% are ever identified. We assessed stability of neurocognitive features across diverse populations and quantified factors mediating outcome. Forty-four boys from the Netherlands (NL) and 54 boys from the United States (US) participated. The Wechsler Intelligence Scales assessed intellectual functioning; the ANT program evaluated cognitive function; and the CBCL assessed behavioral functioning. ANOVA was used for group comparisons. Hierarchical regressions assessed variance explained by each independent variable: parental education, timing of diagnosis, testosterone, age, and nationality. Parental education, timing of diagnosis, and hormonal treatment all played an important role in neurocognitive performance. The observed higher IQ and better attention regulation in the US group as compared to the NL group was observed with decreased levels of behavioral problems in the US group. Cognitive measures that were different between the NL and US groups, i.e., attention regulation and IQ scores, were also significantly influenced by external factors including timing of diagnosis, testosterone treatment, and parental education. On the ANT, a cognitive phenotype of 47,XXY was observed, with similar scores on 9 out of the 10 ANT subtests for the NL and US groups. This study lays additional features to the foundation for an algorithm linking external variables to outcome on various neurodevelopmental measures.

Klinefelter syndrome (KS), a 47,XXY chromosomal abnormality, has been shown to be associated with a number of malignancies, but has not been linked to acute leukemias to date. We present a case of a 54-year-old male diagnosed with acute myeloid leukemia (AML) with monocytic differentiation, whose cytogenetic and subsequent FISH analyses revealed a constitutional 47,XXY karyotype. We also review and discuss relevant prior literature.

Özyörük D, Kocayozgat A, Yaman-Bajin İ, Çetindağ F, Oğuz- Erdoğan AS, Güneş A. A synchronous occurrence of bifocal intracranial germinoma and bilateral testicular epidermoid cyst in an adolescent patient with Klinefelter`s syndrome. Turk J Pediatr 2019; 61: 456-459. Klinefelter syndrome (KS) is characterized by an additional X chromosome in males leading to a karyotype of 47,XXY. It is associated with an increased risk of certain malignancies, including leukemia, breast cancer and extragonadal germ cell tumor such as mediastinal germ cell tumors and rarely intracranial germ cell tumors. It is possible that the increased risk of developing certain cancers can be attributed to a direct effect of the chromosomal abnormality or the combined action of the abnormal chromosomes and hormonal imbalances. Here we describe a synchronous occurrence of bifocal intracranial germinoma and bilateral testicular epidermoid cyst in an adolescent patient with Klinefelter`s syndrome. The synchronous occurrence of the dual tumors in this patient with Klinefelter`s syndrome might be resulted from the migration defect during embriyogenesis due to underlying genetic disease or it is a coincidental condition, yet there has been no case reported in the literature, so far.

The study of sexual dimorphism in psychiatric and neurodevelopmental disorders is challenging due to the complex interplay of diverse biological, psychological, and social factors. Males are more susceptible to neurodevelopmental disorders including intellectual disability, autism spectrum disorder, and attention-deficit activity disorder. Conversely, after puberty, females are more prone to major depressive disorder and anxiety disorders compared to males. One major biological factor contributing to sex differences is the sex chromosomes. First, the X and Y chromosomes have unique and specific genetic effects as well as downstream gonadal effects. Second, males have one X chromosome and one Y chromosome, while females have two X chromosomes. Thus, sex chromosome constitution also differs between the sexes. Due to this complexity, determining genetic and downstream biological influences on sexual dimorphism in humans is challenging. Sex chromosome aneuploidies, such as Turner syndrome (X0) and Klinefelter syndrome (XXY), are common genetic conditions in humans. The study of individuals with sex chromosome aneuploidies provides a promising framework for studying sexual dimorphism in neurodevelopmental and psychiatric disorders. Here we will review and contrast four syndromes caused by variation in the number of sex chromosomes: Turner syndrome, Klinefelter syndrome, XYY syndrome, and XXX syndrome. Overall we describe an increased rate of attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder and autism spectrum disorder, along with the increased rates of major depressive disorder and anxiety disorders in one or more of these conditions. In addition to contributing unique insights about sexual dimorphism in neuropsychiatric disorders, awareness of the increased risk of neurodevelopmental and psychiatric disorders in sex chromosome aneuploidies can inform appropriate management of these common genetic disorders.

Klinefelter's syndrome, characterised by a 47,XXY chromosomal pattern, has largely been associated with physical abnormalities. Here, we report high levels of schizophrenia-spectrum pathology in 32 men with this syndrome in comparison with 26 healthy controls. This may have implications for treatment of have implications for treatment of Klinefelter's syndrome and suggests that the X chromosome may be involved in the aetiology of schizophrenia.

Klinefelter's syndrome is a sex chromosome abnormality affecting approximately 1 in 1000 men. There have been suggestions that it is associated with a higher than average prevalence of sexual offending but to what extent does research evidence support this assertion? This study aimed to conduct a systematic review of published research to establish the prevalence of sexual offending in men with Klinefelter's syndrome. The databases MEDLINE, PsycINFO and EMBASE were searched from inception until 31 December 2016 by using a range of terms for Klinefelter's syndrome and for sexual offending. All selected papers were examined for quality by using the Strengthening the Reporting of Observational Studies in Epidemiology checklist. We identified 53 relevant papers of which 10 met our inclusion criteria. All but one were prevalence studies conducted in a prison or hospital setting. The one, Danish, register-based cohort study did suggest an increased risk of sex offending among Klinefelter men, probably established before the diagnosis was made and, therefore, any hormone replacement instituted. There is insufficient evidence to date to support concerns about exceptional risk of sex offending among men with Klinefelter's syndrome. Rather, it is arguable that there is a research gap in understanding how the experience of and treatment for their condition may affect them. Copyright © 2017 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

Chromosomal abnormality and Y chromosome microdeletion are regarded as two frequent genetic causes associated with spermatogenic failure in Caucasian population. To investigate the distribution of the two genetic defects in Chinese patients with azoospermia or severe oligozoospermia, karyotype analysis by G-banding was carried out in 358 idiopathic infertile men, including 256 patients with azoospermia and 102 patients with severe oligozoospermia, and screening of AZF region microdeletion of Y chromosome by multiplex PCR was performed in those patients without detectable chromosomal abnormality and 100 fertile controls. Of 358 patients, 39(10.9%) were found to have chromosomal abnormalities in which Klinefelter's syndrome (47, XXY) was the most common chromosomal aberration. The incidence of sex chromosomal abnormality in patients with azoospermia was significantly higher than that in patients with severe oligozoospermia (12.1% vs 1%). Among the rest of the 319 patients with normal karyotype, 46 (14.4%) were found to have microdeletions in AZF region. The prevalence rates of AZF microdeletion was 15% and 13.1% in patients with azoospermia and severe oligozoospermia respectively. The microdeletion in AZFc was the most frequent deletion and all the microdeletions in AZFa were found in azoospermic patients. No microdeletion in AZF region was detected in fertile controls. In conclusion, chromosomal abnormality and AZF region microdeletion of Y chromosome might account for about 25% of Chinese infertile patients with azoospermia or severe oligozoospermia, suggesting the two abnormalities are important genetic etiology of spermatogenic failure in Chinese population and it is essential to screen them during diagnosis of male infertility before in vitro assisted fertilization by introcytoplasmic sperm injection.

Klinefelter syndrome is caused by the presence of one or more additional X chromosomes in an affected male. Patients often exhibit gynecomastia, small testes, and infertility. Though the characteristics of Klinefelter have been well-documented, associated ocular abnormalities have been only occasionally reported. Here we present a 2-month-old infant with Klinefelter syndrome and a unique combination of ocular abnormalities including microphthalmia, cataracts, and malformed pupils.

Klinefelter syndrome is a condition in which a male patient has one Y chromosome and one or more extra X chromosomes. It is the most common sex chromosome disorder. Klinefelter syndrome is distinguished by many clinical features, such as infertility, high gonadotropin and low testosterone levels, increased height, and sparse body and facial hair. We report the case of a 32-year-old man who visited our hospital complaining of male infertility. Semen analysis showed azoospermia, and chromosomal analysis revealed a 47,XY,i(X)(q10) karyotype, which is a rare variant of Klinefelter syndrome. No spermatozoon was found on microdissection testicular sperm extraction, and the testis biopsy histology showed only Sertoli cells and hyalinised seminiferous tubules. 47,XY, i(X)(q10) has an additional isochromosome made of the long arm of the X chromosome, which shares some features of classical Klinefelter syndrome in many aspects, but patients are usually shorter than average height and have normal intelligence. In addition, to the best of our knowledge, no successful sperm extractions from 47,XY, i(X)(q10) patients were reported in the literature. The reports of patients who have undergone microdissection testicular sperm extraction are very rare. Further reports and studies of this chromosomal abnormality are needed.

About 1 in 650 boys are born with an extra X chromosome (47,XXY or Klinefelter syndrome). 47,XXY is associated with vulnerabilities in socio-emotional development. This study was designed to assess types of cognitive deficits in individuals with 47,XXY that may contribute to social-emotional dysfunction, and to evaluate the nature of such deficits at various levels: ranging from basic visuospatial processing deficits, impairments in face recognition (FR), to emotion expression impairments. A total of 70 boys and men with 47,XXY, aged 8 to 60 years old, participated in the study. The subtests feature identification, FR and identification of facial emotions of the Amsterdam Neuropsychological Tasks were used. Level of intellectual functioning was assessed with the child and adult versions of the Wechsler Intelligence Scales. Reaction time data showed that in the 47,XXY group, 17% had difficulties in visuospatial processing (no social load), 26% had difficulties with FR (medium social load) and an even higher number of 33% had difficulties with facial expressions of emotions (high-social load). Information processing impairments increased as a function of "social load" of the stimuli, independent of intellectual functioning. Taken together, our data suggest that on average individuals with XXY may have more difficulties in information processing when "social load" increases, suggesting a specific difficulty in the higher-order labeling and interpretation of social cues, which cannot be explained by more basic visuospatial perceptual skills. Considering the increased risk for social cognitive impairments, routine assessment of social cognitive functioning as part of neuropsychological screening is warranted.

In this communication, a case of Klinefelter syndrome associated with a 13/14 translocation is described. Such a rare occurrence is most probably due to the de novo arrangement of chromosomes related to the advanced ages of both parents at conception.
