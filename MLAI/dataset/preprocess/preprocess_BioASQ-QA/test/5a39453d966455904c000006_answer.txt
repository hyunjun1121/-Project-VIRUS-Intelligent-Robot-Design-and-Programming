IDEAL_ANSWER:
- SamExploreR : exploring reproducibility and robustness of RNA-seq results based on SAM files.We introduce the subseq r package, which uses a novel efficient approach to perform this subsampling and to calculate informative metrics at each depth required to inform a broad range of functional and evolutionary studies.Our methods are broadly applicable for polymorphism discovery in moderate to large genomes even at highly diverged loci, and we established by subsampling the illumina sbs coverage depth related questions for the experimental design.SubSeq : determining appropriate sequencing depth through efficient read subsampling.
- Our methods are broadly applicable for polymorphism discovery in moderate to large genomes even at highly diverged loci, and we established by subsampling the Illumina SBS coverage depth required to inform a broad range of functional and evolutionary studies. We introduce the subSeq R package, which uses a novel efficient approach to perform this subsampling and to calculate informative metrics at each depth
- The subSeq R package, which uses a novel efficient approach to perform this subsampling and to calculate informative metrics at each depth
- We applied subsampling to ascertain the effect of training sample size and the number of RNA sequencing reads on classification accuracy of molecular subtype and routine biomarker prediction models . We introduce the subSeq R package, which uses a novel efficient approach to perform this subsampling and to calculate informative metrics at each depth. Interestingly, after subsampling to the same coverage for GSNAP and TopHat, we find that both mappers have similar performance, implying that the advantage of TopHat is mainly an artifact of the lower coverage.
