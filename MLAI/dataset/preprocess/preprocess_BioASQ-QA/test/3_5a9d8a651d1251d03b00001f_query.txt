What is the BioArchive system?

[PMID: 28716596]
Umbilical cord blood (CB) banks usually freeze and store CB for clinical transplantation using conventional controlled-rate freezer or the automated BioArchive system. The aim of this study is to compare the quality of CB cryopreserved with conventional and automated methods and to make clear the cause of the quality difference between the two methods. The experiment used 80 CB units: 40 were conventionally cryopreserved and the remainder were cryopreserved with a BioArchive. After thawing, the following measures of CB quality were compared: recovery rates of cell count, cell viability of total nucleated cells (TNCs), mononuclear cells (MNCs), and CD34+ cells, as well as colony-forming unit-granulocyte/macrophage (CFU-GM) content. Additionally, processing and storage records were reviewed to quantify the number of exposures of CB units at room temperature (transient warming event, TWE), which was analyzed in relation to CB quality. MNC and CD34+ cell viability were as follows: MNC, 78.2% ± 6.8% (conventional), 81.7% ± 7.2% (automated); CD34+ cell, 90.6% ± 6.9% (conventional), 94.7% ± 3.5% (automated). The absolute CFU-GM content per CB unit was 7.1 × 10<sup>5</sup> ± 5.9 × 10<sup>5</sup> with conventional cryopreservation and 12.3 × 10<sup>5</sup> ± 12.0 × 10<sup>5</sup> with automated cryopreservation. CBs cryopreserved with BioArchive showed significantly higher MNC and CD34+ cell viability, and CFU-GM content than those conventionally cryopreserved. The CB quality comparison depending on the amount of TWEs showed no significant quality difference between groups that were more exposed to TWEs and groups that were less exposed. CBs cryopreserved with BioArchive were of higher quality than conventionally cryopreserved CBs, and the cause of quality difference might be due to the difference of freezing conditions rather than the TWE effect.

The limited number of progenitor stem cells in umbilical cord blood (UCB) enforces the optimization and strict control of all the procedures involved in its therapeutic use--ie, collection, processing, cryopreservation, thawing, and transportation--to ensure graft potency at transplantation. For this reason, international UCB standards recommend storage of a cell sample attached to the UCB unit as a quantitative and functional control of the unit selected for transplantation. To validate the use of the sample attached to the UCB unit as a quality-control tool for the final product, UCB units (n = 20) stored in liquid nitrogen with the Bioarchive system were analyzed. The UCB units and their attached segments were thawed, and the number and viability of total nucleated cells, mononucleated cells, CD45 + cells, and CD34+ cells were determined, as were colony-forming cell counts. There was no significant difference between UCB units and segments for any of the parameters assessed. Additionally, the linear correlation coefficient (R2) in these paired samples was 0.85 and 0.78 for CD34+ cells and colony-forming cells, respectively. In conclusion, the cell sample in the tube segment physically linked to the transplant UCB bag predicts the total cell content and functionality of the unit and may serve as a source for final quality control of the UCB unit before transplantation.

The performance of a small-scale automated cryopreservation and storage system (Mini-BioArchive system) used in the banking of umbilical cord blood (UCB) units was evaluated. After thawing the units, the viability and recovery of cells, as well as the recovery rate of hematopoietic progenitor cells (HPCs) such as CD34+ cells, colony-forming unit-granulocyte-macrophage (CFU-GM), and total CFU were analyzed. Twenty UCB units cryopreserved using the automated system and stored for a median of 34 days were analyzed. Mean CD34+ cell viabilities before freezing were 99.8+/-0.5% and after thawing were 99.8+/-0.4% in the large bag compartments and 99.7+/-0.5% in the small compartments. The mean recovery values for total nucleated cells, CD34+ cells, CFU-GM, and total CFU were 94.8+/-16.0%, 99.3+/-18.6%, 103.9+/-20.6%, and 94.3+/-12.5%, respectively in the large compartments, and 95.8+/-25.9%, 106.8+/-23.9%, 101.3+/-23.3%, and 93.8+/-19.2%, respectively in the small compartments. A small-scale automated cryopreservation and storage system did not impair the clonogenic capacity of UCB HPCs. This cryopreservation system could provide cellular products adequate for UCB banking and HPC transplantation.
