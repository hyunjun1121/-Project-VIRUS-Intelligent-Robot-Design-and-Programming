Checkpoint inhibitors with monoclonal antibodies targeting the CTLA-4 or PD-1 axis have revolutionized treatment in some solid tumors, especially melanoma and lung. The role of the CTLA-4 and PD-1 pathways and their inhibition in lymphoma may be different compared to solid tumors. In heavily pretreated Hodgkin lymphoma, PD-1-directed treatment has led to high remission rates. Several studies are now conducted also including diffuse large B-cell and follicular lymphoma. Besides antibody-based immunotherapy, treatment with chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T-cells has also come back to the focus of recent studies. Clinical evidence of CAR T-cell treatment in B-cell malignancies is limited to small series, because of the dedicated resources needed. However, impressive response rates have been observed, but toxicities associated with cytokine release can be very severe and fatal. We herein review the background, early clinical evidence, and future perspectives of T-cell-directed immune manipulation for lymphomas including checkpoint inhibitors and CAR T-cell therapies.

This meta-analysis has been conducted to determine the risk of elevated transaminases associated with immune checkpoint inhibitors use in patients with cancer. Studies eligible for our analysis included randomized Phase II and III trials of patients with cancer on ipilimumab, nivolumab, pembrolizumab, tremelimumab and pidilizumab, which describe events of elevated transaminases [alanine aminotransferase (ALT) and aspartate aminotransferase (AST)]. Initial database search revealed 210 relevant citations. After excluding noneligible studies, 10 trials were considered eligible for the quantitative synthesis. The RR of all-grade elevated ALT and AST was 2.36 (95% CI 1.20-4.66; p = 0.01) and 1.53 (95% CI 0.73-3.22; p = 0.26), respectively, whereas for high-grade elevated ALT and AST, it was 11.27 (95% CI 5.38-23.63; p < 0.0001) and 4.9 (95% CI 2.97-8.09; p < 0.0001), respectively. Our study has shown that the use of immune checkpoint inhibitors has a causal relationship to an increased risk of high-grade elevated ALT and AST. Clinicians using these agents should be attentive of this risk.

Diffuse intrinsic pontine glioma (DIPG) is an incurable disease with a median overall survival of 10 months. Immune modulating antibodies have recently emerged as a highly promising treatment modality in multiple cancer types. We present results from the first study to evaluate the immune modulating antibody MDV9300 (pidilizumab) in pediatric patients with DIPG. All patients aged 3 years and older, diagnosed with DIPG between February 2014 and June 2015 in Israel, were offered to participate in the study. Enrolled patients were started on biweekly 6 mg/kg MDV9300 after radiation completion. Treatment was continued until disease progression on imaging. Patients were followed biweekly for the occurrence of neurological deficit toxicities and side effects. Secondary endpoints were event free survival and overall survival. Of 13 children diagnosed with DIPG during the study period, nine were enrolled in the study. The patients underwent radiotherapy and none had chemotherapy. A total of 83 cycles of MDV9300 (range 2-16) were applied. The main side effects were neutropenia (CTCAE grade 1-3), mild to moderate fatigue, and acute elevation of blood pressure. Four patients died within 1 year of the diagnosis, another three died within 2 years and two children are still alive nearly 30 months from diagnosis, with stable disease. The median event free survival is 9.3 months (range 6.8-24) and the median overall survival is 15.6 months (range 6.9-28). Preliminary results demonstrate that MDV9300 treatment is safe and may be effective in the treatment of children with DIPG.

We performed a meta-analysis of the risk of selected gastrointestinal toxicities associated with immune checkpoint inhibitors. Eligible studies included randomized trials of patients with solid tumors on ipilimumab, nivolumab, pembrolizumab, tremelimumab, pidilizumab and atezolizumab, describing events of diarrhea, vomiting or colitis. After exclusion of ineligible studies, a total of ten clinical trials were considered eligible for the meta-analysis. The relative risk of all-grade diarrhea, vomiting and colitis was 1.64 (95% CI: 1.19-2.26; p = 0.002), 0.72 (95% CI: 0.49-1.07; p = 0.1), 10.35 (95% CI: 5.78-18.53; p < 0.00001), respectively. Our meta-analysis has demonstrated that immune checkpoint inhibitors are associated with a significantly increased risk of all grade and high-grade colitis.

The treatment of metastatic renal cell carcinoma (mRCC) has evolved markedly over the past decade, broaden- ing beyond immune-based strategies (eg, interleukin-2 and interferon-α) to include targeted agents (eg, sunitinib [Sutent, Pfizer] and sorafenib [Nexavar, Bayer]). Recently, there has been a renewed interest in immune-based strategies, with clinical trials underway to assess vaccines and other immunomodulatory agents. Of particular interest are agents that inhibit the interaction between the programmed death-1 (PD-1) receptor and its ligand (PD-L1) at the T-cell/antigen-presenting cell interface. This interaction produces T-cell anergy and therefore stifles the antitumor immune response. Monoclonal antibodies to PD-1 (eg, nivolumab, lambrolizumab, and pidilizumab) and PD-L1 (MPDL3280A and BMS-936559) are in various stages of clinical development. The clinical trajectory of these agents is discussed herein, with specific attention to the potential placement of PD-1/ PD-L1 inhibition in the crowded therapeutic landscape of mRCC.

Immune-regulatory mechanisms are used by cancer to hide from the immune system. Advances and in-depth understanding of the biology of melanoma and its interaction with the immune system have led to the development of some of antagonistic antibodies to the programmed death 1 pathway (PD-1) and one of its ligands, programmed death ligand 1 (PD-L1), which are demonstrating high clinical benefit rates and tolerability. Blocking the immune-regulatory checkpoints that limit T-cell responses to melanoma upon PD-1/PD-L1 modulation has provided clinically validated targets for cancer immunotherapy. Combinations with other anti-melanoma agents may result in additional benefits. Nivolumab, pembrolizumab (formerly known as MK-3475 and lambrolizumab), and pidilizumab are anti-PD-1 antibodies in clinical development for melanoma, non-small cell lung cancer, renal cell carcinoma, head and neck cancers, lymphoma, and several other cancers. Long-term survivors already have been reported with these therapies. In this review, we discuss the current state of anti-PD-1 agents, the evidence in the literature to support the combination of anti-PD-1 antibodies with other anti-cancer agents and discuss the future directions for rational design of clinical trials that keep on increasing the number of long-term survivors.

Advances in understanding of the immune microenvironment have highlighted the role of immunosuppressive T cell, myeloid, dendritic and monocytic sub-populations in inhibition of the anti-tumor immune response. The role of B cells in modulating the immune response to solid tumors as well as lymphoid malignancies is less well understood. Murine models of autoimmune disease have defined B regulatory cell (Breg) subsets with immune suppressive activity, including B cell subsets that express IL-10, and transforming growth factor-β, which can facilitate T regulatory cell recruitment and expansion. Multiple murine tumor models point to the existence of similar immune suppressive B cell sub-populations that can migrate into tumor deposits and acquire an immune suppressive phenotype, which then leads to attenuation of the local anti-tumor immune response. Other murine models of viral or chemically induced skin carcinogenesis have identified a pivotal role for B cells in promoting inflammation and carcinogenesis. While many human solid tumors demonstrate significant B cell infiltration and/or tertiary lymphoid structure formation, the functional properties of tumor-infiltrating B cells and their effects on immunity are poorly understood. Recent successes in early Phase I/II trials using anti-checkpoint inhibitor antibodies such as nivolumab or pidilizumab directed against PD-1 in the setting of Hodgkin's and non-Hodgkin's lymphomas validate the therapeutic utility of reversing B cell-mediated immune suppression. Further studies to define Breg subsets, and mechanisms of suppression, may provide new avenues for modulation of the immune response and meaningful therapeutic intervention in both lymphoid and solid tumors.

Immunotherapeutic strategies are promising approaches for the treatment of follicular lymphoma (FL). However, their efficacy may be limited by immunosuppressive elements in the immune system and tumor microenvironment. Therefore, strategies to reverse the effects of the immunosuppressive elements are needed. We observed that regulatory T cells (Tregs) were increased in the peripheral blood at diagnosis and persisted in high numbers after induction of clinical remission with a cyclophosphamide and doxorubicin-containing chemotherapy regimen in FL patients. High levels of peripheral blood Tregs prior to therapy were associated with decreased progression-free survival in FL patients treated with either chemotherapy or combination immunotherapy that targeted CD20 and PD-1 with monoclonal antibodies rituximab and pidilizumab, respectively. Intratumoral and peripheral blood Tregs potently suppressed autologous antitumor effector T cells in FL. However, the effects of FL Tregs could be reversed by triggering Toll-like receptors (TLR) with TLR ligands Pam3 CSK4 (TLR 1/2), flagellin (TLR 5), and CpG-B (TLR 9), and/or OX40. The TLR ligands synergized with each other as well as OX40 signaling to inhibit Tregs. Furthermore, they restored the function of FL tumor-specific effector T cells. Our results suggest that a state of tolerance exists in FL patients at diagnosis and after induction of clinical remission, and agents that activate TLRs 1/2, 5, and 9, and OX40 may serve as adjuvants to enhance the efficacy of antitumor immunotherapeutic strategies and preventive vaccines against infectious diseases in these patients.

The development of 'immune checkpoint inhibitors' or drugs targeting the programmed death-1 (PD-1)/programmed death-ligand 1 (PD-L1) axis has been a stunning success of cancer immunotherapy. This review provides a timely overview of the biology and function of the PD-1 pathway and discusses the rationale for therapeutic inhibition of this pathway in lymphoma. Recent studies have evaluated the prevalence and prognostic implications of PD-1, PD-L1/2 expression in various lymphoma subtypes. We present an overview of the clinical trials evaluating pidilizumab, nivolumab, and pembrolizumab in patients with lymphoid malignancies, and highlight some of the more promising agents in this class, currently in development. Finally, we discuss biomarkers that may predict response to therapy in patients with lymphoma across these clinical trials. A plethora of clinical trials are in progress testing immune checkpoint inhibitors in many subtypes of lymphoma, which will define their role both as a monotherapy and in combination with other biologic agents.

The standard treatment of advanced melanoma has been changing in recent years. Palliative chemotherapy is being replaced by more efficient targeted therapies and modern immunotherapies based on antibodies against checkpoints of the immune response (so  called checkpoint inhibitors). Todays standard ipilimumab (ant-iCTLA 4 antibody) could significantly prolong overall survival and achieved longterm disease control in about 20% of patients. There are other perspective immune modulating agents, such as anti-PD 1 antibodies (nivolumab, pembrolizumab, pidilizumab) and anti-PD L1 antibodies. Unique mechanism of action is accompanied by new types of immunerelated adverse events. The aim of the article is to summarize current knowledge about the toxicity of these antibodies and propose solutions in routine clinical practice.

Significant enthusiasm currently exists for new immunotherapeutic strategies: blocking the interaction between programmed death-1 receptor on T-cells and programmed death-ligand 1 on tumor cells to boost immune system stimulation to fight cancer. Immunomodulation with the antiprogrammed death-1/programmed death-ligand 1 monoclonal antibodies has shown to mediate tumor shrinkage and extend overall survival from several pivotal phase I/II studies in melanoma, renal cell carcinoma, and non-small cell lung cancer. This has prompted multiple large ongoing phase III trials with the expectation for fast-track FDA approvals to satisfy unmet medical needs. Compounds targeting the programmed death-1 pathway that are in clinical trials fall into two major categories, namely antiprogrammed death-1 antibodies: Nivolumab, MK-3475, and pidilizumab; and antiprogrammed death-ligand 1 antibodies: MPDL3280A, BMS-936559, MEDI4736, and MSB0010718C. We reviewed the clinical efficacy and safety of each compound based upon major registered clinical trials and published clinical data. Overall, response rate of more than 20% is consistently seen across all these trials, with maximal response of approximately 50% achieved by certain single antiprogrammed death-1 agents or when used in combination with cytotoxic T-lymphocyte antigen-4 blockade. The responses seen are early, durable, and have continued after treatment discontinuation. Immune-related adverse events are the most common side effects seen in these clinical trials. Overall, the skin and gastrointestinal tract are the most common organ systems affected by these compounds while hepatic, endocrine, and neurologic events are less frequent. These side effects are low grade, manageable, and typically resolve within a relatively short time frame with a predictable resolution pattern given proper management. We therefore propose detailed guidelines for management of major immune-related adverse events that are anticipated with antiprogrammed death-1/programmed death-ligand 1 therapies based on general experience with other monoclonal antibodies and the established management algorithms for immune-related adverse events for cytotoxic T-lymphocyte antigen-4 blockade with ipilimumab. We anticipate that the antiprogrammed death-1 strategy will become a viable and crucial clinical strategy for cancer therapy.

The programmed death-1 (PD-1) immune checkpoint pathway is an emerging target in the treatment of hematologic malignancies. Pidilizumab is an mAb that binds to PD-1 and is a safe and well-tolerated therapy. Recent data have shown clinical activity utilizing this strategy in diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL). The role of PD-1 expression in hematologic malignancies is explored. Recent clinical trials including the results of a Phase I trial in hematologic malignancies and a Phase II trial of pidilizumab following autologous hematopoietic stem-cell transplant (AHSCT) are reviewed. We review data that suggest that PD-1 is a promising target in the treatment and management of DLBCL. Changes in immune subsets following administration of pidilizumab are felt to represent on-target responses. The improvement in progression-free survival (PFS) following AHSCT supports a response to therapy. Importantly, the improvement in PFS for patients with positive FDG-PET/CT following AHSCT indicating residual disease further supports direct activity of pidilizumab in DLBCL.

The Programmed Death-1 (PD-1) immune checkpoint pathway may be usurped by tumors, including diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL), to evade immune surveillance. The reconstituting immune landscape after autologous hematopoietic stem-cell transplantation (AHSCT) may be particularly favorable for breaking immune tolerance through PD-1 blockade. We conducted an international phase II study of pidilizumab, an anti-PD-1 monoclonal antibody, in patients with DLBCL undergoing AHSCT, with correlative studies of lymphocyte subsets. Patients received three doses of pidilizumab beginning 1 to 3 months after AHSCT. Sixty-six eligible patients were treated. Toxicity was mild. At 16 months after the first treatment, progression-free survival (PFS) was 0.72 (90% CI, 0.60 to 0.82), meeting the primary end point. Among the 24 high-risk patients who remained positive on positron emission tomography after salvage chemotherapy, the 16-month PFS was 0.70 (90% CI, 0.51 to 0.82). Among the 35 patients with measurable disease after AHSCT, the overall response rate after pidilizumab treatment was 51%. Treatment was associated with increases in circulating lymphocyte subsets including PD-L1E-bearing lymphocytes, suggesting an on-target in vivo effect of pidilizumab. This is the first demonstration of clinical activity of PD-1 blockade in DLBCL. Given these results, PD-1 blockade after AHSCT using pidilizumab may represent a promising therapeutic strategy in this disease.

Endogenous or iatrogenic antitumour immune responses can improve the course of follicular lymphoma, but might be diminished by immune checkpoints in the tumour microenvironment. These checkpoints might include effects of programmed cell death 1 (PD1), a co-inhibitory receptor that impairs T-cell function and is highly expressed on intratumoral T cells. We did this phase 2 trial to investigate the activity of pidilizumab, a humanised anti-PD1 monoclonal antibody, with rituximab in patients with relapsed follicular lymphoma. We did this open-label, non-randomised trial at the University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center (Houston, TX, USA). Adult (≥18 years) patients with rituximab-sensitive follicular lymphoma relapsing after one to four previous therapies were eligible. Pidilizumab was administered at 3 mg/kg intravenously every 4 weeks for four infusions, plus eight optional infusions every 4 weeks for patients with stable disease or better. Starting 17 days after the first infusion of pidilizumab, rituximab was given at 375 mg/m(2) intravenously weekly for 4 weeks. The primary endpoint was the proportion of patients who achieved an objective response (complete response plus partial response according to Revised Response Criteria for Malignant Lymphoma). Analysis was by intention to treat. This trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT00904722. We enrolled 32 patients between Jan 13, 2010, and Jan 20, 2012. Median follow-up was 15.4 months (IQR 10.1-21.0). The combination of pidilizumab and rituximab was well tolerated, with no autoimmune or treatment-related adverse events of grade 3 or 4. The most common adverse events of grade 1 were anaemia (14 patients) and fatigue (13 patients), and the most common adverse event of grade 2 was respiratory infection (five patients). Of the 29 patients evaluable for activity, 19 (66%) achieved an objective response: complete responses were noted in 15 (52%) patients and partial responses in four (14%). The combination of pidilizumab plus rituximab is well tolerated and active in patients with relapsed follicular lymphoma. Our results suggest that immune checkpoint blockade is worthy of further study in follicular lymphoma.
