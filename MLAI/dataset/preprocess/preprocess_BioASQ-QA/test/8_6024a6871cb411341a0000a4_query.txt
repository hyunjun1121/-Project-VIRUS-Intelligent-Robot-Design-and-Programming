Which substance use is associated with Brodifacoum poisoning?

[PMID: 31579608]
Synthetic cannabinoids are a commonly used class of recreational drugs that can have significant adverse effects. There have been sporadic reports of co-consumption of illicit drugs with rodenticides such as warfarin and brodifacoum (BFC) over the past 20 years but recently, hundreds of people have been reported to have been poisoned with a mixture of synthetic cannabinoids and BFC. We have sought to establish whether BFC directly affects cannabinoid receptors, or their activation by the synthetic cannabinoid CP55940 or the phytocannabinoid Δ<sup>9</sup>-tetrahydrocannabinol (Δ<sup>9</sup>-THC). The effects of BFC on the hyperpolarization of wild type AtT20 cells, or AtT20 cells stably expressing human CB<sub>1</sub>- or CB<sub>2</sub>- receptors, were studied using a fluorescent assay of membrane potential. The effect of BFC on CB<sub>1</sub>- and CB<sub>2</sub>-mediated inhibition of forskolin-stimulated adenylyl cyclase (AC) activation was measured using a BRET assay of cAMP levels in HEK 293 cells stably expressing human CB<sub>1</sub> or CB<sub>2</sub>. BFC did not activate CB<sub>1</sub> or CB<sub>2</sub> receptors, or affect the hyperpolarization of wild type AtT20 cells produced by somatostatin. BFC (1 µM) did not affect the hyperpolarization of AtT20-CB<sub>1</sub> or AtT20-CB<sub>2</sub> cells produced by CP55940 or Δ<sup>9</sup>-THC. BFC (1 µM) did not affect the inhibition of forskolin-stimulated AC activity by CP55940 in HEK 293 cells expressing CB<sub>1</sub> or CB<sub>2</sub>. BFC (1 µM) also failed to affect the desensitization of CB<sub>1</sub> and CB<sub>2</sub> signaling produced by prolonged (30 min) application of CP55940 or Δ<sup>9</sup>-THC to AtT20 cells. BFC is not a cannabinoid receptor agonist, and appeared not to affect cannabinoid receptor activation. Our data suggests there is no pharmacodynamic rationale for mixing BFC with synthetic cannabinoids; however, it does not speak to whether BFC may affect synthetic cannabinoid metabolism or biodistribution. The reasons underlying the mixing of BFC with synthetic cannabinoids are unknown, and it remains to be established whether the "contamination" was deliberate or accidental. However, the consequences for people who ingested the mixture were often serious, and sometimes fatal, but this seems unlikely to be due to BFC action at cannabinoid receptors.

Recent outbreaks of brodifacoum-induced coagulopathy resulting from the use of synthetic cannabinoids represents a growing public health concern. Brodifacoum is a commonly used and commercially available rodenticide that has anticoagulant properties. As new, unregulated synthetic cannabinoids enter the market, the potential for further outbreaks continues to rise. We report a case of severe bleeding secondary to inhalation of synthetic cannabinoids contaminated with brodifacoum. The patient had been evaluated for several months of ongoing, unexplained vaginal bleeding and developed hematemesis and rectal bleeding 2 weeks after her last reported use. There have been previous reports of hemorrhage after exposure to synthetic marijuana in rare cases, including an outbreak of severe bleeding and reported synthetic marijuana use in the Midwestern region of the United States in 2018. While hemorrhaging after exposure to synthetic cannabinoids has been reported previously, we use this case to increase awareness of the potentially deadly exposures to brodifacoum from synthetic cannabinoids use in Wisconsin. By increasing awareness, emergency department physicians and state agencies can collaborate more effectively when responding in these cases.

Recent evidence demonstrates a rising epidemic of unintentional brodifacoum poisoning associated with synthetic cannabinoid use. Synthetic cannabinoid use is on the rise because of its inexpensiveness as well as difficulty to screen and regulate. We present a rare case of severe coagulopathy and cardiac arrest secondary to synthetic cannabinoid use complicated by brodifacoum toxicity.

A 50-year-old man was admitted to the emergency department with abrupt massive epistaxis. An accurate anamnesis and physical evaluation could not reveal any other anomalies, while coagulation tests showed potentially life threatening prolonged prothrombin time, with activated partial thromboplastin and thrombin time, with fibrinogen and antithrombin III within limits. Despite the prompt pharmacological and compressive local treatment, bleeding continued and the patient was therefore hospitalized. Highly specific coagulation and toxicological testing-among others high-performance liquid chromatography assessment on plasma-were performed, leading to the unexpected identification of brodifacoum. Police and criminal justice authorities revealed the source of exposure to brodifacoum after several months of investigation, residing in his everyday life. Brodifacoum is a long-lasting anticoagulant, acting as a vitamin K antagonist, and belongs to the family of superwarfarins. Brodifacoum use is authorized as rodenticide in many countries worldwide, but has been reported as cause of severe coagulopathies in humans, both intentional or involuntary, even consumed as a contaminant of herbal drugs, such as cannabis. The original contribution of this case to the knowledges of human brodifacoum intoxication resides in the multidisciplinary approach and the collaborative interplay of clinical and toxicology experts as well as judicial authorities.

We report the case of a 17-year-old boy with a significant history of drug and alcohol abuse, which included smoking marijuana mixed with brodifacoum. As a consequence, the patient developed a prolonged coagulopathy that persisted for more than 1 year. To our knowledge, this is the first case reported in the literature in which super-warfarin intoxication has been associated with marijuana smoking. This report should increase the awareness of pathologists and clinicians when examining a patient with a history of drug abuse who exhibits persistent vitamin K1-dependent coagulopathy.

BACKGROUND As marijuana is being legalized in some states in the United States, there is a growing need for physicians to be aware of potential complications related to various forms of marijuana used in the community. Historically, marijuana has been laced with potentially toxic substances to increase its efficacy, and brodifacoum is one of them. Here, we present the case of a patient with toxicity related to use of brodifacoum-laced synthetic marijuana. CASE REPORT A 30-year-old man with history of polysubstance abuse presented with 5 days of flank pain and hematuria. He reported current use of synthetic marijuana. Vital signs were unremarkable. On physical examination, he had petechiae on bilateral upper extremities. Pertinent lab findings included: leukocytosis of 14 000 K/UL, international normalized ratio (INR) 13, prothrombin time (PT) 134.6 s, activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT) 58.3 s, and only hematuria on urinalysis. CT scans of the abdomen and pelvis were unremarkable. The initial toxicology screen was negative. Brodifacoum toxicity was suspected. The patient was managed in collaboration with poison control, and he was treated with oral vitamin K and close monitoring of INR. CONCLUSIONS Brodifacoum-laced synthetic marijuana toxicity can lead to potentially lethal complications if not recognized and treated in a timely manner. Hence, physicians should have a high index of suspicion in patients presenting with unexplained coagulation abnormalities.

In March and April 2018, more than 150 patients presented to hospitals in Illinois with coagulopathy and bleeding diathesis. Area physicians and public health organizations identified an association between coagulopathy and synthetic cannabinoid use. Preliminary tests of patient serum samples and drug samples revealed that brodifacoum, an anticoagulant, was the likely adulterant. We reviewed physician-reported data from patients admitted to Saint Francis Medical Center in Peoria, Illinois, between March 28 and April 21, 2018, and included in a case series adult patients who met the criteria used to diagnose synthetic cannabinoid-associated coagulopathy. A confirmatory anticoagulant poisoning panel was ordered at the discretion of the treating physician. A total of 34 patients were identified as having synthetic cannabinoid-associated coagulopathy during 45 hospitalizations. Confirmatory anticoagulant testing was performed in 15 of the 34 patients, and superwarfarin poisoning was confirmed in the 15 patients tested. Anticoagulant tests were positive for brodifacoum in 15 patients (100%), difenacoum in 5 (33%), bromadiolone in 2 (13%), and warfarin in 1 (7%). Common symptoms at presentation included gross hematuria in 19 patients (56%) and abdominal pain in 16 (47%). Computed tomography was performed to evaluate abdominal pain and revealed renal abnormalities in 12 patients. Vitamin K<sub>1</sub> (phytonadione) was administered orally in all 34 patients and was also administered intravenously in 23 (68%). Red-cell transfusion was performed in 5 patients (15%), and fresh-frozen plasma infusion in 19 (56%). Four-factor prothrombin complex concentrate was used in 1 patient. One patient died from complications of spontaneous intracranial hemorrhage. Our data indicate that superwarfarin adulterants of synthetic cannabinoids can lead to clinically significant coagulopathy. In our series, in most of the cases in which the patient presented with bleeding diathesis, symptoms were controlled with the use of vitamin K<sub>1</sub> replacement therapy. The specific synthetic cannabinoid compounds are not known.

Synthetic marijuana is a dangerous substance due to its potency, ever-changing composition, and unpredictable side effects. Recently, brodifacoum-contaminated synthetic marijuana has led to multiple deaths and morbidity throughout the USA from severe coagulopathy associated with use of this strain of the drug (brodifacoum is a rodenticide and potent Vitamin K antagonist/anticoagulant). We describe the clinical and radiologic findings in two patients who were diagnosed with, and treated for, ingestion of this new strain of synthetic marijuana. The radiologic manifestations were most notable for hemorrhagic pyelitis/ureteritis. Both patients required hospitalization with Vitamin K supplementation. The radiologic and clinical pictures in these patients are important for radiologists to recognize in order to help guide appropriate patient management.
