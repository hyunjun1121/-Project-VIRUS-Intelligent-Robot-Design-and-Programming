IDEAL_ANSWER:
- Instead, cLADs are universally characterized by long stretches of DNA of high A/T content. This suggests that the A/T rule represents a default positioning mechanism that is locally overruled during lineage commitment.
- Cell-type specific LADs also tend to adhere to this "A/T rule" in embryonic stem cells, but not in differentiated cells. Instead, cLADs are universally characterized by long stretches of DNA of high A/T content. Analysis of paralogs suggests that during evolution changes in A/T content have driven the relocation of genes to and from the nuclear lamina, in tight association with changes in expression level Constitutive nuclear lamina-genome interactions are highly conserved and associated with A/T-rich sequence.

- In metazoans, the nuclear lamina is thought to play an important role in the spatial organization of interphase chromosomes, by providing anchoring sites for large genomic segments named lamina-associated domains (LADs). Some of these LADs are cell-type specific, while many others appear constitutively associated with the lamina. Constitutive LADs (cLADs) may contribute to a basal chromosome architecture. cLADs are universally characterized by long stretches of DNA of high A/T content. Cell-type specific LADs also tend to adhere to this "A/T rule" in embryonic stem cells, but not in differentiated cells.
