What is the main difference between nascent and mature chromatin?

[PMID: 6226660]
The effects of inhibiting histone deacetylation on the maturation of newly replicated chromatin have been examined. HeLa cells were labeled with [3H]thymidine in the presence or absence of sodium butyrate; control experiments demonstrated that butyrate did not significantly inhibit DNA replication for at least 70 min. Like normal nascent chromatin, chromatin labeled for brief periods (0.5-1 min) in the presence of butyrate was more sensitive to digestion with DNase I and micrococcal nuclease than control bulk chromatin. However, chromatin replicated in butyrate did not mature as in normal replication, but instead retained approximately 50% of its heightened sensitivity to DNase I. Incubation of mature chromatin in butyrate for 1 h did not induce DNase I sensitivity: therefore, the presence of sodium butyrate was required during replication to preserve the increased digestibility of nascent chromatin DNA. In contrast, sodium butyrate did not inhibit or retard the maturation of newly replicated chromatin when assayed by micrococcal nuclease digestion, as determined by the following criteria: 1) digestion to acid solubility, 2) rate of conversion to mononucleosomes, 3) repeat length, and 4) presence of non-nucleosomal DNA. Consistent with the properties of chromatin replicated in butyrate, micrococcal nuclease also did not preferentially attack the internucleosomal linkers of chromatin regions acetylated in vivo. The observation of a novel chromatin replication intermediate, which is highly sensitive to DNase I but possesses normal resistance to micrococcal nuclease, suggests that nucleosome assembly and histone deacetylation are not obligatorily coordinated. Thus, while deacetylation is required for chromatin maturation, histone acetylation apparently affects chromatin organization at a level distinct from that of core particle or linker, possibly by altering higher order structure.

The DNA of newly replicated chromatin is comprised of two components, distinguishable by their solubility characteristics and requirements for maturation. One of these components possesses core histones, typical nucleosomal structure, a nuclease-resistant core containing 146 base pairs (bp) of new DNA, and all the nucleosomal species found in bulk chromatin (due to bound histone H1 and high mobility group proteins). In addition, this class of nascent chromatin exhibits a shortened repeat length of approximately 165 bp, as opposed to the 288-bp repeat of bulk chromatin. Within 10 min of DNA synthesis, the spacing of mature chromatin is established; the spacing maturation can occur in the absence of protein synthesis. The second class of nascent DNA is distinguished from the nucleosomal component by its insolubility, lack of discernible nucleosomal organization, and dependence on protein synthesis to attain typical subunit structure. This unassembled component is not free DNA, as demonstrated by its intermediate resistance to nucleolytic degradation. The structural properties and maturation requirements of this material suggest that it is the site of de novo nucleosome assembly.

During chromatin replication and nucleosome assembly, newly synthesized histone H4 is acetylated before it is deposited onto DNA, then deacetylated as assembly proceeds. In a previous study (Perry and Annunziato, Nucleic Acids Res. 17, 4275 [1989]) it was shown that when replication occurs in the presence of sodium butyrate (thereby inhibiting histone deacetylation), nascent chromatin fails to mature fully and instead remains preferentially sensitive to DNaseI, more soluble in magnesium, and depleted of histone H1 (relative to mature chromatin). In the following report the relationships between chromatin replication, histone acetylation, and H1-mediated nucleosome aggregation were further investigated. Chromatin was replicated in the presence or absence of sodium butyrate; isolated nucleosomes were stripped of linker histone, reconstituted with H1, and treated to produce Mg(2+)-soluble and Mg(2+)-insoluble chromatin fractions. Following the removal of H1, all solubility differences between chromatin replicated in sodium butyrate for 30 min (bu-chromatin) and control chromatin were lost. Reconstitution with H1 completely restored the preferential Mg(2+)-solubility of bu-chromatin, demonstrating that a reduced capacity for aggregation/condensation is an inherent feature of acetylated nascent nucleosomes; however, titration with excess H1 caused the solubility differences to be lost again. Moreover, when the core histone N-terminal "tails" (the sites of acetylation) were removed by trypsinization prior to reconstitution, H1 was unable to reestablish the altered solubility of chromatin replicated in butyrate. Thus, the core histone "tails," and the acetylation thereof, not only modulate H1-mediated nucleosome interactions in vitro, but also strongly influence the ability of H1 to differentiate between new and old nucleosomes. The data suggest a possible mechanism for the control of H1 deposition and/or chromatin folding during nucleosome assembly.
