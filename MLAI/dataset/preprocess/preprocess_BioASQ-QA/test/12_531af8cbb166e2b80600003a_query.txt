How many genes outside of the MHC locus have been genetically associated to Rheumatoid Arthritis through GWAS?

[PMID: 21542789]
Recent results from genetic and treatment studies have shed new light on chronic inflammatory and autoimmune diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis (RA). In particular, genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have provided supportive evidence that RA is a disease with a strong genetic background. Interestingly, a series of candidate genes have been identified outside of the classical major histocompatibility (MHC) locus, which had long been regarded as the major contributor to the pathogenesis of this disease. Among these genes, PTPN22 plays an outstanding role. CD40, STAT4, PRM1, and TNFAIP3 also seem to be of relevance. Interestingly, there is a significant overlap between RA susceptibility genes and those of other autoimmune diseases such as systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) and type 1 diabetes, which suggests common pathogenic mechanisms. Genetic analyses may not only provide new insights into the pathogenesis of RA, but may also open new avenues for therapeutic approaches, because overactive immune-signaling pathways might specifically be addressed by biologic therapies. However, the predictive value of many of the recent findings of large-scale genetic analyses in identifying new genetic polymorphisms remains low. We describe the current knowledge about the role of non-MHC genes in the pathogenesis of rheumatoid arthritis.

Candidate gene association studies and genome-wide association studies (GWAs) have identified a large number of single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) loci affecting susceptibility to rheumatoid arthritis (RA). However, for the same locus, some studies have yielded inconsistent results. To assess all the available evidence for association, we performed a meta-analysis on previously published case-control studies investigating the association between SNPs and RA. Two hundred and sixteen studies, involving 125 SNPs, were reviewed. For each SNP, three genetic models were considered: the allele, dominant and recessive effects models. For each model, the effect summary odds ratio (OR) and 95% CIs were calculated. Cochran's Q-statistics were used to assess heterogeneity. If the heterogeneity was high, a random effects model was used for meta-analysis, otherwise a fixed effects model was used. The meta-analysis results showed that: (1) 30, 28 and 26 SNPs were significantly associated with RA (P<0.01) for the allele, dominant, and recessive models, respectively. (2) rs2476601 (PTPN22) showed the strongest association for all the three models: OR = 1.605, 95% CI: 1.540-1.672, P<1.00E-15 for the T-allele; OR = 1.638, 95% CI: 1.565-1.714, P<1.00E-15 for the T/T+T/C genotype and OR = 2.544, 95% CI: 2.173-2.978, P<1.00E-15 for the T/T genotype. (3) Only 23 (18.4%), 13 (10.4%) and 15 (12.0%) SNPs had high heterogeneity (P<0.01) for the three models, respectively. (4) For some of the SNPs, there was no publication bias according to Funnel plots and Egger's regression tests (P<0.01). For the other SNPs, the associations were tested in only a few studies, and may have been subject to publication bias. More studies on these loci are required. Our meta-analysis provides a comprehensive evaluation of the RA association studies from the past two decades.

To identify new genetic risk factors for rheumatoid arthritis, we conducted a genome-wide association study meta-analysis of 5,539 autoantibody-positive individuals with rheumatoid arthritis (cases) and 20,169 controls of European descent, followed by replication in an independent set of 6,768 rheumatoid arthritis cases and 8,806 controls. Of 34 SNPs selected for replication, 7 new rheumatoid arthritis risk alleles were identified at genome-wide significance (P < 5 x 10(-8)) in an analysis of all 41,282 samples. The associated SNPs are near genes of known immune function, including IL6ST, SPRED2, RBPJ, CCR6, IRF5 and PXK. We also refined associations at two established rheumatoid arthritis risk loci (IL2RA and CCL21) and confirmed the association at AFF3. These new associations bring the total number of confirmed rheumatoid arthritis risk loci to 31 among individuals of European ancestry. An additional 11 SNPs replicated at P < 0.05, many of which are validated autoimmune risk alleles, suggesting that most represent genuine rheumatoid arthritis risk alleles.

Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is a polygenic autoimmune disease primarily affecting the synovial joints. Numerous animal models show similarities to RA in humans; some of them not only mimic the clinical phenotypes but also demonstrate the involvement of homologous genomic regions in RA. This paper compares corresponding non-MHC genomic regions identified in rodent and human genome-wide association studies (GWAS). To date, over 30 non-MHC RA-associated loci have been identified in humans, and over 100 arthritis-associated loci have been identified in rodent models of RA. The genomic regions associated with the disease are designated by the name(s) of the gene having the most frequent and consistent RA-associated SNPs or a function suggesting their involvement in inflammatory or autoimmune processes. Animal studies on rats and mice preferentially have used single sequence length polymorphism (SSLP) markers to identify disease-associated qualitative and quantitative trait loci (QTLs) in the genome of F2 hybrids of arthritis-susceptible and arthritis-resistant rodent strains. Mouse GWAS appear to be far ahead of rat studies, and significantly more mouse QTLs correspond to human RA risk alleles.

The "Bermuda triangle" of genetics, environment and autoimmunity is involved in the pathogenesis of rheumatoid arthritis (RA). Various aspects of genetic contribution to the etiology, pathogenesis and outcome of RA are discussed in this review. The heritability of RA has been estimated to be about 60 %, while the contribution of HLA to heritability has been estimated to be 11-37 %. Apart from known shared epitope (SE) alleles, such as HLA-DRB1*01 and DRB1*04, other HLA alleles, such as HLA-DRB1*13 and DRB1*15 have been linked to RA susceptibility. A novel SE classification divides SE alleles into S1, S2, S3P and S3D groups, where primarily S2 and S3P groups have been associated with predisposition to seropositive RA. The most relevant non-HLA gene single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) associated with RA include PTPN22, IL23R, TRAF1, CTLA4, IRF5, STAT4, CCR6, PADI4. Large genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have identified more than 30 loci involved in RA pathogenesis. HLA and some non-HLA genes may differentiate between anti-citrullinated protein antibody (ACPA) seropositive and seronegative RA. Genetic susceptibility has also been associated with environmental factors, primarily smoking. Some GWAS studies carried out in rodent models of arthritis have confirmed the role of human genes. For example, in the collagen-induced (CIA) and proteoglycan-induced arthritis (PgIA) models, two important loci - Pgia26/Cia5 and Pgia2/Cia2/Cia3, corresponding the human PTPN22/CD2 and TRAF1/C5 loci, respectively - have been identified. Finally, pharmacogenomics identified SNPs or multiple genetic signatures that may be associated with responses to traditional disease-modifying drugs and biologics.

The advent of high-throughput single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) omics technologies has brought tremendous genetic data. Systematic evaluation of the genome-wide SNPs is expected to provide breakthroughs in the understanding of complex diseases. In this study, we developed a new systematic method for mapping multiple loci and applied the proposed method to construct a genetic network for rheumatoid arthritis (RA) via analysis of 746 multiplex families genotyped with more than five thousands of genome-wide SNPs. We successfully identified 41 significant SNPs relevant to RA, 25 associated genes and a number of important SNP-SNP interactions (SNP patterns). Many findings (loci, genes and interactions) have experimental support from previous studies while novel findings may define unknown genetic pathways for this complex disease. Finally, we constructed a genetic network by integrating the results from this analysis with the rapidly accumulated knowledge in biomedical domains, which gave us a more detailed insight onto the RA etiology. The results suggest that the proposed systematic method is powerful when applied to genome-wide association studies. Integrating the analysis of high-throughput SNP data with knowledge-based SNP functional annotation offers a promising way to reversely engineer the underlying genetic networks for complex human diseases.

To review recent progress in the genetics of rheumatoid arthritis (RA) and discuss the implications for understanding the pathogenesis of the disease as well as clinical application. Protection against anticitrullinated protein antibody (ACPA) positive RA was shown to be associated wit DRB1*1301. Genome-wide association studies (GWASs) added about 10 new loci to the list of already more than 20 loci associated with RA, so the list is now over 30. Typing for the known risk loci is not helpful for prediction of the risk for RA. It is remarkable how few functional studies have been published. Known genetic factors explain 50-60% of the genetic variance for susceptibility to ACPA-positive and 30-50% for ACPA-negative RA. Searching for the remaining missing or hidden heritability is in all probability not going to yield much for prediction and/or targeted intervention. Therefore, I conclude that if you want to find more genes you should have a lot of patience, time and money, stop with convential GWAS and invest in large-scale sequencing of selected patients and controls. I have a better suggestion, however: use the information that is already available to perform functional studies in order to understand the mechanism of the known associations!

A major goal of current human genome-wide studies is to identify the genetic basis of complex disorders. However, the availability of an unbiased, reliable, cost efficient and comprehensive methodology to analyze the entire genome for complex disease association is still largely lacking or problematic. Therefore, we have developed a practical and efficient strategy for whole genome association studies of complex diseases by charting the human genome at 100 kb intervals using a collection of 27,039 microsatellites and the DNA pooling method in three successive genomic screens of independent case-control populations. The final step in our methodology consists of fine mapping of the candidate susceptible DNA regions by single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) analysis. This approach was validated upon application to rheumatoid arthritis, a destructive joint disease affecting up to 1% of the population. A total of 47 candidate regions were identified. The top seven loci, withstanding the most stringent statistical tests, were dissected down to individual genes and/or SNPs on four chromosomes, including the previously known 6p21.3-encoded Major Histocompatibility Complex gene, HLA-DRB1. Hence, microsatellite-based genome-wide association analysis complemented by end stage SNP typing provides a new tool for genetic dissection of multifactorial pathologies including common diseases.

Investigators have made key advances in rheumatoid arthritis (RA) genetics in the past 10 years. Although genetic studies have had limited influence on clinical practice and drug discovery, they are currently generating testable hypotheses to explain disease pathogenesis. Firstly, we review here the major advances in identifying RA genetic susceptibility markers both within and outside of the MHC. Understanding how genetic variants translate into pathogenic mechanisms and ultimately into phenotypes remains a mystery for most of the polymorphisms that confer susceptibility to RA, but functional data are emerging. Interplay between environmental and genetic factors is poorly understood and in need of further investigation. Secondly, we review current knowledge of the role of epigenetics in RA susceptibility. Differences in the epigenome could represent one of the ways in which environmental exposures translate into phenotypic outcomes. The best understood epigenetic phenomena include post-translational histone modifications and DNA methylation events, both of which have critical roles in gene regulation. Epigenetic studies in RA represent a new area of research with the potential to answer unsolved questions.

Rheumatoid Arthritis (RA) is the most common chronic inflammatory disease of the joints and is characterized by a complex genetic architecture. In recent years, a substantial advance has been performed in the identification of the genes that increase the risk to develop RA. Genome-Wide Association Studies (GWAS) have allowed the characterization of more than 40 new susceptibility genes and the confirmation of a marked differential genetic background between patients expressing anti-cyclic citrullinated peptide antibodies (ACPA, approximately 80% of all RA patients) and ACPA negative RA patients. GWAS have also confirmed the existence of a common genetic basis between RA and other autoimmune diseases and the overrepresentation of specific biological pathways like antigen presentation and TNF signaling. Dense genotyping analysis has also allowed the detailed characterization of the different association signals within the HLA region, the strongest risk locus for RA. In the present manuscript, we also review the most recent advances in the genetics of clinically relevant subphenotypes in RA which are the response to treatment and the severity of the disease. In the next years the increasing ability to characterize the DNA variation and the availability of well characterized patient cohorts will be critical to translate genetic information into the much awaited personalized medicine in RA.

Recent human genetic discoveries have increased our understanding of rheumatoid arthritis (RA) susceptibility. Genome-wide association studies have expanded the number of validated RA risk loci beyond HLA-DRB1 "shared epitope" alleles to include additional major histocompatibility complex (MHC) risk alleles and more than 10 regions outside the MHC. The newly discovered risk alleles are common in the general population, have a modest effect on RA risk, and together explain less than 5% of the variance in disease risk. Whereas the actual causal mutation and causal gene for most loci remain to be determined, these studies are beginning to reveal general themes: many risk loci are associated with other autoimmune diseases; many genes fall within discrete biological pathways (eg, the nuclear factor kappa-light-chain-enhancer of activated B cells signaling pathway); and human genetics can group diseases into clinically meaningful subset categories (eg, presence or absence of autoantibodies). This review discusses recent RA genetic discoveries in terms of their potential to improve patient care.

Epidemiology and candidate gene studies indicate a shared genetic basis for celiac disease (CD) and rheumatoid arthritis (RA), but the extent of this sharing has not been systematically explored. Previous studies demonstrate that 6 of the established non-HLA CD and RA risk loci (out of 26 loci for each disease) are shared between both diseases. We hypothesized that there are additional shared risk alleles and that combining genome-wide association study (GWAS) data from each disease would increase power to identify these shared risk alleles. We performed a meta-analysis of two published GWAS on CD (4,533 cases and 10,750 controls) and RA (5,539 cases and 17,231 controls). After genotyping the top associated SNPs in 2,169 CD cases and 2,255 controls, and 2,845 RA cases and 4,944 controls, 8 additional SNPs demonstrated P<5 × 10(-8) in a combined analysis of all 50,266 samples, including four SNPs that have not been previously confirmed in either disease: rs10892279 near the DDX6 gene (P(combined) =  1.2 × 10(-12)), rs864537 near CD247 (P(combined) =  2.2 × 10(-11)), rs2298428 near UBE2L3 (P(combined) =  2.5 × 10(-10)), and rs11203203 near UBASH3A (P(combined) =  1.1 × 10(-8)). We also confirmed that 4 gene loci previously established in either CD or RA are associated with the other autoimmune disease at combined P<5 × 10(-8) (SH2B3, 8q24, STAT4, and TRAF1-C5). From the 14 shared gene loci, 7 SNPs showed a genome-wide significant effect on expression of one or more transcripts in the linkage disequilibrium (LD) block around the SNP. These associations implicate antigen presentation and T-cell activation as a shared mechanism of disease pathogenesis and underscore the utility of cross-disease meta-analysis for identification of genetic risk factors with pleiotropic effects between two clinically distinct diseases.
