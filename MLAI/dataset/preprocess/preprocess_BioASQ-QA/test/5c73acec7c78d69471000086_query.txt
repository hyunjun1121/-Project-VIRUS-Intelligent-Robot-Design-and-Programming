The GABAA receptor (GABAAR) is a major target of antiseizure drugs (ASDs). A variety of agents that act at GABAARs s are used to terminate or prevent seizures. Many act at distinct receptor sites determined by the subunit composition of the holoreceptor. For the benzodiazepines, barbiturates, and loreclezole, actions at the GABAAR are the primary or only known mechanism of antiseizure action. For topiramate, felbamate, retigabine, losigamone and stiripentol, GABAAR modulation is one of several possible antiseizure mechanisms. Allopregnanolone, a progesterone metabolite that enhances GABAAR function, led to the development of ganaxolone. Other agents modulate GABAergic "tone" by regulating the synthesis, transport or breakdown of GABA. GABAAR efficacy is also affected by the transmembrane chloride gradient, which changes during development and in chronic epilepsy. This may provide an additional target for "GABAergic" ASDs. GABAAR subunit changes occur both acutely during status epilepticus and in chronic epilepsy, which alter both intrinsic GABAAR function and the response to GABAAR-acting ASDs. Manipulation of subunit expression patterns or novel ASDs targeting the altered receptors may provide a novel approach for seizure prevention.

About 3% of people will be diagnosed with epilepsy during their lifetime, but about 70% of people with epilepsy eventually go into remission. We conducted a systematic review and aimed to answer the following clinical questions: What are the effects of starting antiepileptic drug treatment following a single seizure? What are the effects of drug monotherapy in people with partial epilepsy? What are the effects of additional drug treatments in people with drug-resistant partial epilepsy? What is the risk of relapse in people in remission when withdrawing antiepileptic drugs? What are the effects of behavioural and psychological treatments for people with epilepsy? What are the effects of surgery in people with drug-resistant temporal lobe epilepsy? We searched: Medline, Embase, The Cochrane Library, and other important databases up to July 2009 (Clinical Evidence reviews are updated periodically; please check our website for the most up-to-date version of this review). We included harms alerts from relevant organisations such as the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and the UK Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA). We found 83 systematic reviews, RCTs, or observational studies that met our inclusion criteria. We performed a GRADE evaluation of the quality of evidence for interventions. In this systematic review we present information relating to the effectiveness and safety of the following interventions: antiepileptic drugs after a single seizure; monotherapy for partial epilepsy using carbamazepine, gabapentin, lamotrigine, levetiracetam, phenobarbital, phenytoin, sodium valproate, or topiramate; addition of second-line drugs for drug-resistant partial epilepsy (allopurinol, eslicarbazepine, gabapentin, lacosamide, lamotrigine, levetiracetam, losigamone, oxcarbazepine, retigabine, tiagabine, topiramate, vigabatrin, or zonisamide); antiepileptic drug withdrawal for people with partial or generalised epilepsy who are in remission; behavioural and psychological treatments for partial or generalised epilepsy (biofeedback, cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT), educational programmes, family counselling, relaxation therapy (alone or plus behavioural modification therapy, yoga); and surgery for drug-resistant temporal lobe epilepsy ( lesionectomy, temporal lobectomy, vagus nerve stimulation as adjunctive therapy).

1. Losigamone is a novel anticonvulsant the mechanism of action of which is not known. This study investigated the effect of losigamone on spontaneous, NMDA- and AMPA-induced depolarizations in the cortical wedge preparation of the DBA/2 mouse (which are susceptible to sound-induced seizures) and on endogenous amino acid release from BALB/c mouse cortical slices. 2. Cortical wedges exhibit spontaneous depolarizations in magnesium-free medium and losigamone was effective in significantly reducing these spontaneous depolarizations at concentrations of 100 microM and above. 3. NMDA-induced depolarizations were significantly reduced by losigamone at concentrations of 25 microM and above. Losigamone had no effect on AMPA-induced depolarizations. 4. Veratridine (20 microM) and potassium (60 mM) were used to stimulate the release of amino acids from mouse cortex. Veratridine-stimulated release of glutamate was significantly reduced by losigamone at concentrations of 100 microM and above, while potassium-stimulated release was significantly reduced by losigamone at 200 microM. 5. NMDA antagonism and inhibition of excitatory amino acid release may contribute to the anticonvulsant effect of losigamone.

Epilepsy is a common neurologic disorder, affecting approximately 50 million people worldwide; nearly a third of these people have epilepsy that is not well controlled by a single antiepileptic drug (AED) and they usually require treatment with a combination of two or more AEDs. In recent years, many newer AEDs have been investigated as add-on therapy for focal epilepsy; losigamone is one of these drugs and is the focus of this systematic review. This is an update of a Cochrane review first published in 2012 (Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews 2012, Issue 6) and updated in 2015. To investigate the efficacy and safety of losigamone when used as an add-on therapy for focal epilepsy. For the latest update on 9 February 2017, we searched the Cochrane Epilepsy Specialized Register, CENTRAL and MEDLINE . We searched trials registers and contacted the manufacturer of losigamone and authors of included studies for additional information. We did not impose any language restrictions. Randomized controlled, add-on trials comparing losigamone with placebo for focal epilepsy. Two review authors independently assessed trial quality and extracted data. The primary outcomes were 50% or greater reduction in seizure frequency and seizure freedom; the secondary outcomes were treatment withdrawal and adverse events. Results are presented as risk ratios (RRs) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) or 99% CIs (for the individual listed adverse events to make an allowance for multiple testing). Two trials involving a total of 467 participants, aged over 18 years, were eligible for inclusion. Both trials assessed losigamone 1200 mg/day or 1500 mg/day as an add-on therapy for focal epilepsy. We assessed one trial as being of good methodological quality while the other was of uncertain quality. For the efficacy outcomes, results did show that participants taking losigamone were significantly more likely to achieve a 50% or greater reduction in seizure frequency (RR 1.76, 95% CI 1.14 to 2.72), but associated with a significant increase of treatment withdrawal when compared with those taking placebo (RR 2.16, 95% CI 1.28 to 3.67). For the safety outcomes, results indicated that the proportion of participants who experienced adverse events in the losigamone group was higher than in the placebo group (RR 1.34, 95% CI 1.00 to 1.80), dizziness was the only adverse event significantly reported in relation to losigamone (RR 3.82, 99% CI 1.69 to 8.64). The proportion of participants achieving seizure freedom was not reported in either trial report. A subgroup analysis according to different doses of losigamone showed that a higher dose of losigamone (1500 mg/day) was associated with a greater reduction in seizure frequency than lower doses, but was also associated with more dropouts due to adverse events. The results of this review showed that losigamone did reduce seizure frequency but was associated with more treatment withdrawals when used as an add-on therapy for people with focal epilepsy. However, the included trials were of short-term duration and uncertain quality. Future well-designed randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trials with a longer-term duration are needed. No new studies have been found since the last version of this review. We judged the overall quality of the evidence for the outcomes assessed as moderate.

Epilepsy is one of the most prevalent neurological syndromes in the world today. Epilepsy describes a group of brain disorders whose symptoms and causes are diverse and complicated, but all share a common behavioural manifestation: the seizure. Seizures result from the abnormal discharge of groups of neurons within the brain, usually within a focal point, that can result in the recruitment of large brain regions into epileptiform activity. Although the range of explanations for the development of seizures can be as varied as genetic composition to acute head trauma, the net result is often similar. The excitability of neurons is governed by the input they receive from their neighbours and the intrinsic excitability of the neuron. In this review we focus on elements that are crucial to determining the intrinsic excitability of neurons in the CNS, the voltage gated ion channels (VGICs). VGICs as well as being important for physiological function are critical in producing hyperexcitability such as that associated with seizure discharges. Many drugs routinely used in the clinical setting, as well as several novel experimental drugs, have shown interactions with VGICs that underpin, at least in part, their anticonvulsant action. We review the physiological roles of voltage gated ion channels that are selective for sodium, potassium and calcium conductance and attempt to highlight their role in the pathology of epilepsy. This is supplemented by the mechanisms of drug action at these important anticonvulsant targets for classical and clinically relevant compounds (e.g. phenytoin, ethosuximide) as well as some important second generation drugs (e.g. gabapentin, levetiracetam) and novel experimental agents (e.g. retigabine, losigamone, safinamide). We also briefly discuss the urgent need for new drugs in this arena and the potential of combinatorial methods and recombinant screening to identify leads.

As an extension of a previous validation study, the concentration-dependent effects of a series of anticonvulsant drugs were examined in aggregating cell cultures of foetal rat telencephalon. Cultures were treated either at an early (day 5 to day 14) or at an advanced (day 20 to day 28) developmental stage, and assayed for changes in the activities of the cell type-specific enzymes choline acetyltransferase (ChAT), acetylcholinesterase (AChE), glutamic acid decarboxylase (GAD), glutamine synthetase (GS) and 2',3'-cyclic nucleotide 3'-phosphohydrolase (CNP). Five drugs (carbamazepine, diazepam, phenobarbital, phenytoin and valproate), currently used in the treatment of epileptic patients, were tested together with losigamone, a recently developed anticonvulsant. The results show distinct, concentration-dependent patterns of biochemical changes for the different drugs. Phenytoin, carbamazepine, losigamone and diazepam greatly reduced GAD, ChAT and AChE activities, indicating a relatively high neuron-specific toxic potential. Diazepam produced a more general pattern of toxicity and, in contrast to the anticonvulsants, showed higher toxicity in less-differentiated cultures. Phenobarbital and valproate slightly but significantly increased the activities of several enzymes. The patterns of concentration-dependent effects observed in this three-dimensional cell culture system are in good agreement with the presumed neurotoxic and/or teratogenic potential of these drugs.

Patients with drug resistant epilepsy represent about 40% of the whole population of epileptic patients. These patients require more than one antiepileptic drug. In animal models of epilepsy, it is possible to determine which combinations produce supra-additive anticonvulsive effects with minimal or even no adverse reactions. The experimental data can be helpful for predicting effective drug combinations in patients with refractory epilepsy. Losigamone is a new antiepileptic drug with an unknown mechanism of action. The drug belongs to the group of beta-methoxy-butenolides, and exists as a racemic mixture of two enantiomers (AO-242 and AO-294). The drug is eliminated by oxidation. Cytochrome CYP2A6 appears to be the main isoenzyme responsible for the metabolism of losigamone. In vitro, losigamone exerts anticonvulsant activity in the picrotoxin model in CA1 and CA3 hippocampal areas, the low Ca(2+) model in CA1 area and the low Mg(2+) model in the entorhinal cortex and hippocampus. In vivo, the drug exhibits significant efficacy against maximal electroshock-induced seizures in rodents and pentetrazole-induced clonic convulsions in mice. Potency of losigamone varies with the respective seizure test, animal species used in experiments and route of drug administration. Toxicity studies do not indicate any teratogenic risk of the drug, at least in animals. In clinical trial, losigamone proved to have satisfactory effectiveness and good tolerance in the treatment of partial and secondary generalized seizures. The enantiomer AO-242 seems to be more potent than AO-294 or racemate.

The objective of the study was to investigate the efficacy and safety of two different dosages of Losigamone (LSG) in add-on treatment of partial seizures. In a multi-center, double-blind, randomized clinical trial, patients received one of three 12-week treatments: placebo, LSG 1200 mg/day, or 1500 mg/day, in addition to up to three standard anticonvulsants after a prospective period of 12 weeks to assess baseline seizure frequency. The primary efficacy measure was the relative reduction of seizure frequency per 4 weeks in the double-blind phase as compared to baseline. In the intention-to-treat population of 264 patients, the relative median reduction of partial seizure frequency was 3.3% for placebo, 19.7% for LSG 1200 mg/day, and 25.3% for LSG 1500 mg/day. The differences of both LSG groups versus placebo were significant (P<0.01, two-tailed). In the responder analysis, 11.8% of the patients in the placebo group, 17.2% in the LSG 1200 mg/day group, and 29.3% in the LSG 1500 mg/day group showed a seizure reduction versus baseline of at least 50%. A positive association between dosage and response was observed (P=0.003). Adverse events during treatment were reported by 58.8% of the patients for placebo, by 62.1% for LSG 1200 mg/day and by 76.1% for LSG 1500 mg/day. Most events in the LSG groups occurred during the first 4 weeks of double-blind (during or immediately after up-titration) and subsided quickly. Over the last 4 weeks of treatment, the incidence of adverse events in the LSG groups was close to the placebo level. Based on the study's results, LSG is an effective and safe add-on drug for refractory partial epilepsy in adults.

The influence of the new antiepileptic drug losigamone (CAS 112856-44-7/123783-52-8) on the pharmacokinetics of a combined oral contraceptive containing ethinylestradiol (CAS 57-63-6) and levonorgestrel (CAS 797-63-7) was investigated in 16 healthy women. This phase I study consisted of 3 periods with an uncontrolled first period and a double-blind, placebo-controlled, cross-over design in the second and third period. All subjects received a single dose of 200 mg losigamone (1 tablet) in period 1 (on day 14) as well as multiple doses of losigamone (3 tablets = 600 mg per day) or placebo for 15 days in periods 2 and 3. During all three periods an oral contraceptive containing 30 microg ethinylestradiol and 150 microg levonorgestrel was given. Single-dose pharmacokinetics was investigated on day 14 of period 1. Multiple-dose pharmacokinetic investigations were performed on day 15 of periods 2 and 3. The samples were assayed to derive pharmacokinetic data of ethinylestradiol and levonorgestrel. In addition, the concentrations of losigamone racemate (AO-33) and its enantiomers AO-242 and AO-294 were determined in these samples. The mean values of the pharmacokinetic parameters AUC and Cmax of ethinylestradiol and levonorgestrel after multiple-dose treatment with losigamone or placebo were quite similar and met the criteria for bioequivalence. The 90% confidence intervals of the log-transformed ratios of the geometric means of the primary pharmacokinetic variables were included in the respective acceptance ranges of 80% to 125% (AUC) and 70% to 143% (Cmax). The study demonstrated that multiple doses of losigamone did not influence the multiple dose kinetics of ethinylestradiol and levonorgestrel. The single- and multiple-dose kinetics of 200 mg losigamone and its enantiomeres did not differ from each other in a significant way. The combination of losigamone and the combined oral contraceptive was well tolerated and no serious adverse events occurred. It can be stated that the antiepileptic drug losigamone and the combined contraceptive do not interact each others metabolism.
