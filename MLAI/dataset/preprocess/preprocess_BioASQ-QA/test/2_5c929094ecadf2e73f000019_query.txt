What happens to retrotransposons during ageing?

[PMID: 27692431]
Cellular senescence, an irreversible growth arrest triggered by a variety of stressors, plays important roles in normal physiology and tumor suppression, but accumulation of senescent cells with age contributes to the functional decline of tissues. Senescent cells undergo dramatic alterations to their chromatin landscape that affect genome accessibility and their transcriptional program. These include the loss of DNA-nuclear lamina interactions, the distension of centromeres, and changes in chromatin composition that can lead to the activation of retrotransposons. Here we discuss these findings, as well as recent advances in microscopy and genomics that have revealed the importance of the higher-order spatial organization of the genome in defining and maintaining the senescent state.

Retrotransposons are activated as organisms age, based on work from several model systems. Since these mobile DNA elements can promote genome instability, this has raised the possibility that they can contribute to loss of cellular function with age. Many questions remain to be addressed about the relationship between retrotransposons and aging, so it is unclear if changes in their activity will be found to contribute to aging or to be a consequence of aging. A few broad perspectives are presented regarding how continued work on these elements could provide important insights into the aging process, regardless of whether their mobility is ultimately found to significantly contribute to reduced lifespan and healthspan.
