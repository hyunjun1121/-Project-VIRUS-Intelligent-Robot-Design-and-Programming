Which virus is Cidofovir (Vistide) indicated for?

Cytomegalovirus (CMV) infection is very common throughout the world, and has become more of a pediatric clinical concern given the high incidence of congenital CMV infections as well as the increasing numbers of immunocompromised patients. Because of this, the need for antiviral therapies in infants and neonates is growing. Currently, there are four antivirals available that are active against CMV: ganciclovir, valganciclovir, foscarnet, and cidofovir. At this time, none have approved indications for use in children. Although there are limited data regarding the dose, pharmacokinetics (PK), safety, and adverse events for some of these antivirals, ganciclovir, and its oral prodrug valganciclovir, have been the best studied in the infant and neonate populations. In general, pharmaceutical PK studies in young children are limited by the constraints of sampling difficulties and blood volume requirements; fewer sampling times and studies may be available for drug evaluation. Given this caveat, ganciclovir and valganciclovir PK in children thus far appears to follow a monocompartmental model, contrary to what has been described in adults. However, when normalized for weight, the volume of distribution, clearance, and half-life of ganciclovir are similar to those found in adults. Given the findings that ganciclovir (and thus valganciclovir) clearance is directly proportionate to renal function, care must be taken when administering the drug to patients with impaired renal function. Recent studies evaluating valganciclovir PK in infants (at a dose of 16 mg/kg every 12 hours) have shown similar areas under the plasma concentration-time curve (AUCs) to intravenous ganciclovir (at a dose of 6 mg/kg every 12 hours), and that these AUCs remain quite stable over a number of weeks. As seen in adults, oral ganciclovir has a low bioavailability (4.8% in a pediatric analysis) and is therefore a poor alternative for treating serious CMV infections. Neutropenia is the most frequent toxicity associated with ganciclovir and valganciclovir therapy, whereas significant (and possibly irreversible) renal toxicity can be seen with cidofovir. Foscarnet administration can also result in renal toxicity as well as significant electrolyte imbalances. Several of these drugs have potential toxicities that are of concern, including carcinogenesis, teratogenesis, and azospermia (ganciclovir, valganciclovir, and cidofovir) and deposition into bone or dentition (foscarnet) that may have significant implications when treating an infant. Given these potential ill effects, careful consideration of the indications for the clinical use of these antivirals is necessary before using them for CMV infection in neonates and infants.

Cytomegalovirus (CMV) infection remains a major cause of morbidity and mortality in recipients of an allogeneic stem cell transplant (SCT). Due to the broad application of antiviral prophylaxis and preemptive therapy, a decrease in early-onset and a subsequent increase in late-onset CMV disease has been observed. New data on the latency state and reactivation of CMV have been presented, the role of T-cell responses in the control of CMV further substantiated, and viral immune escape mechanisms described in more detail. Sensitive diagnostic assays using nucleic acid amplification and hybridization techniques have been commercialized and will allow standardization of CMV diagnostics in antiviral drug trials. Quantification of the viral load will be increasingly considered for initiation and, in patients with persistence of high viral titers despite antiviral therapy, screening for antiviral drug resistance. Clinical data are emerging to show that, apart from ganciclovir, foscarnet can be given safely even after allogeneic SCT. Additional drugs like lobucavir and cidofovir have been used for specific indications. Interactions of immunosuppressive drugs and antiviral compounds of clinical relevance have been described. Thus, therapeutic drug monitoring and targeted antiviral drug dosing will become standard practice in antiviral treatment strategies in patients following allogeneic SCT.

Immunocompromised hosts are at increased risk of cytomegalovirus (CMV) infection and serious CMV disease. CMV infection is an important cause of morbidity among patients infected with HIV and after solid organ transplantation (SOT) and may cause life-threatening disease in allogeneic stem cell transplant (SCT) recipients. The introduction into clinical use of potent antiviral compounds and of rapid detection assays for CMV during the past two decades has allowed development of strategies for the prevention and treatment of disease caused by CMV in these groups of immunocompromised patients. At present, the antiviral drugs ganciclovir, foscarnet and cidofovir are commonly used in the treatment of CMV infection and disease. However, these agents have a poor oral bioavailability and, for systemic use, require iv. administration for most indications. Valganciclovir is an oral prodrug of ganciclovir, with a 10-fold greater bioavailability than oral ganciclovir. Studies of the pharmacokinetics of valganciclovir among HIV-infected CMV-seropositive patients and liver transplant recipients suggest that this oral compound has the potential to replace both oral and iv. ganciclovir in many situations if it is shown to be as efficacious and safe as those ganciclovir formulations in immunodeficient patients. In the first part of this review, currently established approaches to the management of CMV infection and disease in SCT and SOT recipients and HIV-infected patients are discussed to highlight possible indications for future valganciclovir use; in the second part, data from human studies of valganciclovir are presented.

A retrospective study was performed to collect information regarding efficacy and toxicity of cidofovir (CDV) in allogeneic stem cell transplant patients. Data were available on 82 patients. The indications for therapy were cytomegalovirus (CMV) disease in 20 patients, primary preemptive therapy in 24 patients, and secondary preemptive therapy in 38 patients. Of the patients, 47 had received previous antiviral therapy with ganciclovir, foscarnet, or both drugs. The dosage of CDV was 1 to 5 mg/kg per week followed by maintenance every other week in some patients. The duration of therapy ranged from 1 to 134 days (median, 22 days). All patients received probenecid and prehydration. Ten of 20 (50%) patients who were treated for CMV disease (9 of 16 with pneumonia) responded to CDV therapy, as did 25 of 38 (66%) patients who had failed or relapsed after previous preemptive therapy and 15 of 24 (62%) patients in whom CDV was used as the primary preemptive therapy. Of the patients, 21 (25.6%) developed renal toxicity that remained after cessation of therapy in 12 patients. Fifteen patients developed other toxicities that were potentially due to CDV or the concomitantly given probenecid. No toxicity was seen in 45 (61.6%) patients. Cidofovir can be considered as second-line therapy in patients with CMV disease failing previous antiviral therapy. However, additional studies are needed before CDV can be recommended for preemptive therapy.
