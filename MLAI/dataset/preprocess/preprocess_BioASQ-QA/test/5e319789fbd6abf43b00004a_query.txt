Which molecule is inhibited by encorafenib?

[PMID: 31050693]
BRAF is a constituent of the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) signaling pathway, which serves to activate downstream MEK, and is one of the most commonly mutated oncogenes in human tumors. Indeed, BRAF V600 mutations are present in approximately 40% of metastatic melanoma tumors. Encorafenib (LGX-818, Braftovi) and binimetinib (MEK-162, Mektovi) are small-molecule inhibitors of BRAF and MEK, respectively. BRAF and MEK inhibitors have been shown to improve overall and progression-free survival among patients with metastatic melanoma. Of these inhibitors, encorafenib and binimetinib are the newest combination, which received approval by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for the treatment of BRAF V600E/K-mutated melanoma in June 2018. This review will focus on the preclinical pharmacology, pharmacokinetics and clinical utility of encorafenib and binimetinib in BRAF V600-mutated melanoma.

Cutaneous toxicities under therapy with selective BRAF inhibitors such as vemurafenib or encorafenib (LGX818) are frequent, including plantar hyperkeratosis, squamous cell carcinoma, and second primary melanoma. Pyogenic granuloma is a benign, rapidly growing, eruptive hemangioma that often bleeds and ulcerates. Common causes are mechanical trauma and cast immobilization, as well as multiple drugs such as retinoids and antineoplastic agents. However, the development of pyogenic granuloma under treatment with encorafenib (LGX818) has not yet been reported. These three cases might be further examples for paradoxical activation of the mitogen-activated protein kinase pathway. We report three male patients with metastatic BRAFV600E-mutated melanoma who developed pyogenic granulomas 16, 10, and 12 weeks after treatment initiation with the selective BRAF inhibitors vemurafenib or encorafenib (LGX818). Except for one patient receiving retinoids, the clinical history for other frequent causes of pyogenic granuloma was negative. Pyogenic granulomas are not listed in the drugs investigator brochure but seem to be associated with selective BRAF inhibitors and might be a cutaneous phenomenon of paradoxical mitogen-activated protein kinase pathway activation. This correlation has to be confirmed by further observations.

Encorafenib, a new-generation BRAF inhibitor, has been approved by FDA for the treatment of melanoma in combination with binimetinib. However, the mechanism of the drug works in colorectal cancer (CRC) is still unclear. In this study, the suppression of growth of CRC cells by encorafenib was investigated. The effects of treatment of encorafenib on pathways linked to cancer were studied, and the effective inhibition of cell proliferation was documented. Our findings showed that cell migration was inhibited by encorafenib through a likely involvement of MPP and TIMP modulation. Furthermore, encorafenib treatment also induced cell cycle arrest. In addition, induction of apoptosis in CRC cells by elevating levels of PUMA. These observations indicate the potential therapeutic efficacy of encorafenib on CRC.

BRAF and MEK inhibitors have significantly improved the prognosis of metastatic melanoma, by inhibiting both the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAP-kinase) pathway. They are associated with infrequent adverse kidney events. Most of these are related to the use of BRAF inhibitors and involve interstitial nephritis with acute tubular necrosis. We report a unique case of glomerulonephritis with renal granulomatous vasculitis in a patient diagnosed with metastatic melanoma treated with BRAF and MEK inhibitors. The patient was a 55-year old woman, who presented a melanoma of the right thigh with pulmonary metastasis. Treatment started in November 2015, with Encorafenib and Binimetinib, new BRAF and MEK inhibitors, respectively. Two months after the beginning of the treatment, there was a worsening of her renal function with significant proteinuria. Kidney biopsy showed extracapillary proliferation in the glomeruli with a granulomatous reaction. Renal function recovered completely after withdrawal of the chemotherapy. All the reported kidney adverse events secondary to BRAF and MEK inhibitors in the literature are related to the use of BRAF inhibitors. Some previous reported mechanistic investigations also provide insight between BRAF inhibitors and podocytes injuries. Therefore, encorafenib most likely is the main responsible of the disease. However, evidence has emerged that inhibition of the MAP kinase pathway could also enhance autoimmunity. Thus, binimetinib may also have played a role and the combination of BRAF and MEK inhibitors may have facilitated this autoimmune kidney disease.

BRAF mutations occur in ~10% of colorectal cancer (CRC) and are associated with poor prognosis. Inhibitors selective for the BRAF<sup>V600E</sup> oncoprotein, the most common BRAF mutant, elicit only poor response rates in BRAF-mutant CRC as single agents. This unresponsiveness was mechanistically attributed to the loss of negative feedbacks on the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) and initiated clinical trials that combine BRAF (and MEK) inhibitors, either singly or in combination, with the anti-EGFR antibodies cetuximab or panitumumab. First results of these combinatorial studies demonstrated improved efficacy, however, the response rates still were heterogeneous. Here, we show that BRAF inhibition leads to the upregulation of a variety of receptor tyrosine kinases (RTKs) in CRC cell lines, including not only the EGFR, but also human epidermal growth factor receptor (HER) 2 and HER3. Importantly, combination of the BRAF inhibitors (BRAFi) vemurafenib (PLX4032), dabrafenib, or encorafenib with inhibitors dually targeting the EGFR and HER2 (such as lapatinib, canertinib, and afatinib) significantly reduced the metabolic activity and proliferative potential of CRC cells. This re-sensitization was also observed after genetic depletion of HER2 or HER3. Interestingly, BRAF inhibitors did not only upregulate RTKs, but also increased the abundance of the GRB2-associated binders (Gab) 1 and Gab2, two important amplifiers of RTK signaling. An allele-specific shRNA-mediated knockdown of BRAF<sup>V600E</sup> revealed that Gab2 upregulation was directly dependent on the loss of the oncoprotein and was not caused by an "off-target" effect of these kinase inhibitors. Furthermore, Gab2 and Gab2-mediated Shp2 signaling were shown to be functionally important in BRAFi resistance. These findings highlight potential new escape mechanisms to these targeted therapies and indicate that a broad suppression of RTK signaling might be beneficial and should be taken into account in future research addressing targeted therapy in BRAF-mutant CRC.

RAF kinase is crucially involved in cell proliferation and survival in colorectal cancer (CRC). Patients with metastatic CRC (mCRC) harboring BRAF mutations (BRAFms) not only experience a poor prognosis but also benefit less from therapeutics targeting ERK signaling. With advances in RAF inhibitors and second-generation inhibitors including encorafenib and vemurafenib, which have been approved for treating BRAF-V600E malignancies, the combinatorial therapeutic strategies of RAF inhibitors elicit remarkable responses in patients with BRAF-V600E mCRC. However, the therapeutic efficacy is restricted by resistance, which might be due to RAF dimerization and reactivation of the MAPK pathway. In addition, the next-generation RAF inhibitors, which are characterized by varying structural and biochemical properties, have achieved preclinical and clinical advances. Herein, we summarize the existing mechanism of RAF kinases in CRC, including MAPK feedback reactivation of resistance to RAF inhibitors. We additionally summarize the development of three generations of RAF inhibitors and different therapeutic strategies including the combination of EGFR, BRAF, and PI3K inhibitors for BRAFm CRC treatment.

The FDA approved the BRAF/MEK inhibitor combination encorafenib/binimetinib for patients with metastatic or inoperable melanoma with a BRAF V600E or V600K mutation. The approval was based on results of a phase III trial in which patients treated with the combination had a median progression-free survival of 14.9 months, compared with 7.3 months in a control group that received vemurafenib alone.

Historically, there were few effective and durable treatments for metastatic melanoma. Recently, mutation based targeted therapies have revolutionized treatment and outcomes for patients with metastatic melanoma. Specifically, inhibitors aimed at BRAF, NRAS, and C-KIT mutations are now commonly used in treatment for patients harboring the specific mutations. Areas covered: A brief review of current BRAF, NRAS, and C-KIT inhibitors provides background for a thorough review of newly developed agents namely binimetinib, a MEK inhibitor, encorafenib a BRAF inhibitor, and masitinib which inhibits C-KIT. Expert opinion: While the 3 novel agents reviewed here have potential for use in melanoma, optimal utilization will occur once a more personalized approach incorporating genomic, proteomic, and immunologic data guides therapeutic decisions.

Acquired resistance of metastatic melanoma (MM) tumors to <i>BRAF</i> V600E inhibitors (BRAFi's) is commonplace in the clinic. Habitual relapse of patients contributes to <20% 5-year survival rates in MM. We previously identified serine synthesis as a critical detrminant of late-stage cancer cell resistance to BRAFi's. Pre-treatment with DNA damaging agent gemcitabine (a nucleoside analog) re-sensitized drug-resistant cancer cells to BRAFi's dabrafenib and vemurafenib. Importantly, the combination treatments were effective against BRAF wild type cancer cells potentially expanding the clinical reach of BRAFi's. In this study, we identify the antifolate methotrexate (MTX) as a sensitizer of acquired- and intrinsically-resistant MM cells to BRAFi's dabrafenib and encorafenib. We identify a novel, positive correlation between dabrafenib treatments and repair delay of MTX induced single-strand DNA (ssDNA) breaks. Cells arrest in G1 phase following simultaneous MTX + dabrafenib treatments and eventually die via apoptosis. Importantly, we identify RAS codon 12 activating mutations as prognostic markers for MTX + BRAFi treatment efficacy. We describe a method of killing drug-resistant MM cells that if translated has the potential to improve MM patient survival.

To describe the pharmacological properties, preclinical and clinical data of the novel V-Raf Murine Sarcoma Viral Oncogene Homolog B (BRAF)-inhibitor encorafenib (LGX818) and to compare these with established BRAF-inhibitors in the treatment of locally advanced or metastatic melanoma. Encorafenib has shown improved efficacy in the treatment of metastatic melanoma in comparison with vemurafenib. Combination with the MEK inhibitor (MEKi) binimetinib allows for higher dose intensities of encorafenib further improving response rates (RRs). Combination therapy with BRAF and MEKi has evolved as a standard of care in the treatment of locally advanced or metastatic BRAF-mutated melanoma. Despite compelling initial RRs, development of treatment resistance eventually leads to tumor progression in the majority of BRAF/MEK-inhibitor treated patients. Moreover, treatment-related adverse events are frequent, resulting in a substantial proportion of dose modifications and/or treatment discontinuations. The second-generation BRAF inhibitor encorafenib has been developed aiming at improved efficacy and tolerability through modifications in pharmacological properties. Clinical phase 3 data show improved progression-free survival both for encorafenib monotherapy and combination therapy with binimetinib compared with vemurafenib. Overall survival data and regulatory approval of this novel substance are eagerly awaited.

To test second-line personalized medicine combination therapies, based on genomic and proteomic data, in patient-derived xenograft (PDX) models. We established 12 PDXs from BRAF inhibitor-progressed melanoma patients. Following expansion, PDXs were analyzed using targeted sequencing and reverse-phase protein arrays. By using multi-arm preclinical trial designs, we identified efficacious precision medicine approaches. We identified alterations previously described as drivers of resistance: NRAS mutations in 3 PDXs, MAP2K1 (MEK1) mutations in 2, BRAF amplification in 4, and aberrant PTEN in 7. At the protein level, re-activation of phospho-MAPK predominated, with parallel activation of PI3K in a subset. Second-line efficacy of the pan-PI3K inhibitor BKM120 with either BRAF (encorafenib)/MEK (binimetinib) inhibitor combination or the ERK inhibitor VX-11e was confirmed in vivo Amplification of MET was observed in 3 PDX models, a higher frequency than expected and a possible novel mechanism of resistance. Importantly, MET amplification alone did not predict sensitivity to the MET inhibitor capmatinib. In contrast, capmatinib as single agent resulted in significant but transient tumor regression in a PDX with resistance to BRAF/MEK combination therapy and high pMET. The triple combination capmatinib/encorafenib/binimetinib resulted in complete and sustained tumor regression in all animals. Genomic and proteomic data integration identifies dual-core pathway inhibition as well as MET as combinatorial targets. These studies provide evidence for biomarker development to appropriately select personalized therapies of patients and avoid treatment failures.

Combination treatment with a BRAF inhibitor and MEK inhibitor is the standard of care for patients with advanced BRAF<sup>V600</sup> mutation-positive melanoma. With the currently available combinations of dabrafenib plus trametinib and vemurafenib plus cobimetinib, median progression-free survival (PFS) of over 12 months has been achieved. However, treatment resistance and disease recurrence remain a clinical challenge. Areas covered: Encorafenib in combination with bimetinib offers a new approach that may offer benefits over existing BRAF/MEK inhibitor combinations. Expert opinion: While other BRAF/MEK inhibitor combinations have achieved a median overall survival (OS) of 22 months, patients with advanced BRAF mutation-positive melanoma treated with encorafenib plus binimetinib achieved a median OS of 33.6 months in the phase III COLUMBUS trial. PFS also appears to be improved with encorafenib plus binimetinib. This improved efficacy may be related to the distinct pharmacokinetics of encorafenib, with prolonged binding to the target molecule providing greater BRAF inhibition and increased potency compared with other drugs in the same class. Increased specificity of encorafenib may also result in better tolerability with less off-target effects, including reduced occurrence of pyrexia and photosensitivity. Encorafenib plus binimetinib seems likely to emerge as a valuable therapeutic alternative to established BRAF/MEK inhibitor combinations.

Dual MAPK pathway inhibition (dMAPKi) with BRAF and MEK inhibitors improves survival in BRAF V600E/K mutant melanoma, but the efficacy of dMAPKi in non-V600 BRAF mutant tumors is poorly understood. We sought to characterize the responsiveness of class II (enhanced kinase activity, dimerization dependent) BRAF mutant melanoma to dMAPKi. Tumors from patients with BRAF wild-type (WT), V600E (class I), and L597S (class II) metastatic melanoma were used to generate patient-derived xenografts (PDX). We assembled a panel of melanoma cell lines with class IIa (activation segment) or IIb (p-loop) mutations and compared these with WT or V600E/K BRAF mutant cells. Cell lines and PDXs were treated with BRAFi (vemurafenib, dabrafenib, encorafenib, and LY3009120), MEKi (cobimetinib, trametinib, and binimetinib), or the combination. We identified 2 patients with BRAF L597S metastatic melanoma who were treated with dMAPKi. BRAFi impaired MAPK signaling and cell growth in class I and II BRAF mutant cells. dMAPKi was more effective than either single MAPKi at inhibiting cell growth in all class II BRAF mutant cells tested. dMAPKi caused tumor regression in two melanoma PDXs with class II BRAF mutations and prolonged survival of mice with class II BRAF mutant melanoma brain metastases. Two patients with BRAF L597S mutant melanoma clinically responded to dMAPKi. Class II BRAF mutant melanoma is growth inhibited by dMAPKi. Responses to dMAPKi have been observed in 2 patients with class II BRAF mutant melanoma. These data provide rationale for clinical investigation of dMAPKi in patients with class II BRAF mutant metastatic melanoma.<i>See related commentary by Johnson and Dahlman, p. 6107</i>.

Encorafenib (LGX818) is a new-generation BRAF inhibitor that is under evaluation in clinical trials. However, the underlying mechanism remains to be elucidated. Here we show that LGX818 potently decreased ERK phosphorylation and inhibited proliferation in BRAFV600E melanoma cell lines. Moreover, LGX818 downregulated CyclinD1 in a glycogen synthase kinase 3β-independent manner and induced cell cycle arrest in the G1 phase, Surprisingly, LGX818 triggered cellular senescence in BRAFV600E melanoma cells, as evidenced by increased β-galactosidase staining, while no appreciable induction of apoptosis was detected, as determined by Annexin V and propidium iodide staining and immunoblot analysis of caspase-3 processing and poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase cleavage. Increased p27KIP1 expression and retinoblastoma protein activation were detected during LGX818-induced senescence. Additionally, inhibition of dual-specificity tyrosine phosphorylation-regulated kinase 1B by AZ191 reversed LGX818-induced CyclinD1 turnover and senescence. Interestingly, autophagy is triggered through inhibition of the mTOR/70S6K pathway during LGX818-induced senescence. Moreover, autophagy inhibition by pharmacological and genetic regulation attenuates LGX818-induced senescence. Notably, combining LGX818 with autophagy modulators has anti-proliferative effect in LGX818-resistant BRAF mutant melanoma cells. Altogether, we uncovered a mechanism by which LGX818 exerts its anti-tumor activity in BRAFV600E melanoma cells.

Combined BRAF-MEK inhibitor therapy is the standard of care for BRAF<sup>V600</sup>-mutant advanced melanoma. We investigated encorafenib, a BRAF inhibitor with unique target-binding properties, alone or in combination with the MEK inhibitor binimetinib, versus vemurafenib in patients with advanced BRAF<sup>V600</sup>-mutant melanoma. COLUMBUS was conducted as a two-part, randomised, open-label phase 3 study at 162 hospitals in 28 countries. Eligible patients were aged 18 years or older and had histologically confirmed locally advanced (American Joint Committee on Cancer [AJCC] stage IIIB, IIIC, or IV), unresectable or metastatic cutaneous melanoma, or unknown primary melanoma; a BRAF<sup>V600E</sup> or BRAF<sup>V600K</sup> mutation; an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status of 0 or 1; and were treatment naive or had progressed on or after previous first-line immunotherapy. In part 1 of the study, patients were randomly assigned (1:1:1) via interactive response technology to receive either oral encorafenib 450 mg once daily plus oral binimetinib 45 mg twice daily (encorafenib plus binimetinib group), oral encorafenib 300 mg once daily (encorafenib group), or oral vemurafenib 960 mg twice daily (vemurafenib group). The primary endpoint was progression-free survival by blinded independent central review for encorafenib plus binimetinib versus vemurafenib. Efficacy analyses were by intention-to-treat. Safety was analysed in patients who received at least one dose of study drug and one postbaseline safety assessment. The results of part 2 will be published separately. This study is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT01909453, and EudraCT, number 2013-001176-38. Between Dec 30, 2013, and April 10, 2015, 577 of 1345 screened patients were randomly assigned to either the encorafenib plus binimetinib group (n=192), the encorafenib group (n=194), or the vemurafenib group (n=191). With a median follow-up of 16·6 months (95% CI 14·8-16·9), median progression-free survival was 14·9 months (95% CI 11·0-18·5) in the encorafenib plus binimetinib group and 7·3 months (5·6-8·2) in the vemurafenib group (hazard ratio [HR] 0·54, 95% CI 0·41-0·71; two-sided p<0·0001). The most common grade 3-4 adverse events seen in more than 5% of patients in the encorafenib plus binimetinib group were increased γ-glutamyltransferase (18 [9%] of 192 patients), increased creatine phosphokinase (13 [7%]), and hypertension (11 [6%]); in the encorafenib group they were palmoplantar erythrodysaesthesia syndrome (26 [14%] of 192 patients), myalgia (19 [10%]), and arthralgia (18 [9%]); and in the vemurafenib group it was arthralgia (11 [6%] of 186 patients). There were no treatment-related deaths except for one death in the combination group, which was considered possibly related to treatment by the investigator. Encorafenib plus binimetinib and encorafenib monotherapy showed favourable efficacy compared with vemurafenib. Overall, encorafenib plus binimetinib appears to have an improved tolerability profile compared with encorafenib or vemurafenib. Encorafenib plus binimetinib could represent a new treatment option for patients with BRAF-mutant melanoma. Array BioPharma, Novartis.

<b>Purpose:</b> Encorafenib, a selective BRAF inhibitor (BRAFi), has a pharmacologic profile that is distinct from that of other clinically active BRAFis. We evaluated encorafenib in a phase I study in patients with BRAFi treatment-naïve and pretreated <i>BRAF</i>-mutant melanoma.<b>Experimental Design:</b> The pharmacologic activity of encorafenib was first characterized preclinically. Encorafenib monotherapy was then tested across a range of once-daily (50-700 mg) or twice-daily (75-150 mg) regimens in a phase I, open-label, dose-escalation and -expansion study in adult patients with histologically confirmed advanced/metastatic <i>BRAF</i>-mutant melanoma. Study objectives were to determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) and/or recommended phase II dose (RP2D), characterize the safety and tolerability and pharmacokinetic profile, and assess the preliminary antitumor activity of encorafenib.<b>Results:</b> Preclinical data demonstrated that encorafenib inhibited BRAF V600E kinase activity with a prolonged off-rate and suppressed proliferation and tumor growth of <i>BRAF</i> V600E-mutant melanoma models. In the dose-escalation phase, 54 patients (29 BRAFi-pretreated and 25 BRAFi-naïve) were enrolled. Seven patients in the dose-determining set experienced dose-limiting toxicities. Encorafenib at a dose of 300 mg once daily was declared the RP2D. In the expansion phase, the most common all-cause adverse events were nausea (66%), myalgia (63%), and palmar-plantar erythrodysesthesia (54%). In BRAFi-naïve patients, the overall response rate (ORR) and median progression-free survival (mPFS) were 60% and 12.4 months [95% confidence interval (CI), 7.4-not reached (NR)]. In BRAFi-pretreated patients, the ORR and mPFS were 22% and 1.9 months (95% CI, 0.9-3.7).<b>Conclusions:</b> Once-daily dosing of single-agent encorafenib had a distinct tolerability profile and showed varying antitumor activity across BRAFi-pretreated and BRAFi-naïve patients with advanced/metastatic melanoma. <i>Clin Cancer Res; 23(18); 5339-48. ©2017 AACR</i>.

Mutations in BRAF activate oncogenic MAPK signalling in almost half of cutaneous melanomas. Inhibitors of BRAF (BRAFi) and its target MEK are widely used to treat melanoma patients with BRAF mutations but unfortunately acquired resistance occurs in the majority of patients. Resistance results from mutations or non-genomic changes that either reactivate MAPK signalling or activate other pathways that provide alternate survival and growth signalling. Here, we show the histone deacetylase inhibitor (HDACi) panobinostat overcomes BRAFi resistance in melanoma, but this is dependent on the resistant cells showing a partial response to BRAFi treatment. Using patient- and in vivo-derived melanoma cell lines with acquired BRAFi resistance, we show that combined treatment with the BRAFi encorafenib and HDACi panobinostat in 2D and 3D culture systems synergistically induced caspase-dependent apoptotic cell death. Key changes induced by HDAC inhibition included decreased PI3K pathway activity associated with a reduction in the protein level of a number of receptor tyrosine kinases, and cell line dependent upregulation of pro-apoptotic BIM or NOXA together with reduced expression of anti-apoptotic proteins. Independent of these changes, panobinostat reduced c-Myc and pre-treatment of cells with siRNA against c-Myc reduced BRAFi/HDACi drug-induced cell death. These results suggest that a combination of HDAC and MAPK inhibitors may play a role in treatment of melanoma where the resistance mechanisms are due to activation of MAPK-independent pathways.

Encorafenib (LGX818) is a promising BRAF<sup>V600E</sup> inhibitor that has efficacy against metastatic melanoma. To better understand its pharmacokinetics, we studied its interactions with the multidrug efflux transporters ABCB1 and ABCG2 and the multidrug metabolizing enzyme CYP3A. In polarized MDCK-II cells, encorafenib was efficiently transported by canine and human ABCB1 and ABCG2 and by mouse Abcg2. Upon oral administration to wild-type, Abcb1a/1b<sup>-/-</sup>, Abcg2<sup>-/-</sup>, and Abcb1a/1b;Abcg2<sup>-/-</sup> mice, encorafenib was absorbed very quickly and to very high plasma levels, but without clear changes in oral availability between the strains. Upon oral or intravenous administration, encorafenib brain accumulation was markedly increased in Abcb1a/1b;Abcg2<sup>-/-</sup> mice and to a lesser extent in Abcb1a/1b<sup>-/-</sup> mice. However, absolute brain concentrations and brain-to-plasma ratios remained very low in all strains, indicating intrinsically poor brain penetration of encorafenib. Upon intravenous administration, Abcb1a/1b;Abcg2<sup>-/-</sup> mice showed somewhat reduced plasma elimination of encorafenib compared to wild-type mice, and lower accumulation of the drug in the intestinal tract, suggesting a limited role for these transporters in intestinal elimination of the drug. In Cyp3a<sup>-/-</sup> mice plasma levels of encorafenib were not markedly increased, suggesting a limited impact of Cyp3a on encorafenib oral availability. The low brain penetration of encorafenib might limit its efficacy against malignancies positioned behind a functional blood-brain barrier, but its oral bioavailability and distribution to other tested organs (liver, kidney, spleen, testis) was high.

Encorafenib (Braftovi™), a BRAF inhibitor, and binimetinib (Mektovi<sup>®</sup>), a MEK inhibitor, are two orally bioavailable drugs developed by Array BioPharma. In June 2018 they each received their first global approval, in the USA, for use in combination, for patients with unresectable or metastatic melanoma with a BRAF<sup>V600E</sup> or <sup>-V600K</sup> mutation as detected by an FDA-approved test. Registration applications for encorafenib and binimetinib for use in combination in the treatment of BRAF-mutation-positive advanced melanoma have also been submitted in the EU, Australia, Switzerland and Japan, with the EMA Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use adopting a positive opinion in July 2018 towards granting the drugs marketing authorizations in the EU. Encorafenib plus binimetinib combination therapy is also in ongoing phase III clinical development in the treatment of metastatic colorectal cancer. This article summarizes the milestones in the development of encorafenib and binimetinib leading to these first approvals for the treatment of BRAF<sup>V600E</sup> or <sup>-V600K</sup>-mutation-positive unresectable or metastatic melanoma.
