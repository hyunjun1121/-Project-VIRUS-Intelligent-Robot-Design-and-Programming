5-Formyluracil (fU), a major methyl oxidation product of thymine, forms correct (fU:A) and incorrect (fU:G) base pairs during DNA replication. In the accompanying paper (Masaoka, A., Terato, H., Kobayashi, M., Honsho, A., Ohyama, Y., and Ide, H. (1999) J. Biol. Chem. 274, 25136-25143), it has been shown that fU correctly paired with A is recognized by AlkA protein (Escherichia coli 3-methyladenine DNA glycosylase II). In the present work, mispairing frequency of fU with G and cellular repair protein that specifically recognized fU:G mispairs were studied using defined oligonucleotide substrates. Mispairing frequency of fU was determined by incorporation of 2'-deoxyribonucleoside 5'-triphosphate of fU opposite template G using DNA polymerase I Klenow fragment deficient in 3'-5' exonuclease. Mispairing frequency of fU was dependent on the nearest neighbor base pair in the primer terminus and 2-12 times higher than that of thymine at pH 7.8 and 2.6-6.7 times higher at pH 9.0 with an exception of the nearest neighbor T(template):A(primer). AlkA catalyzed the excision of fU placed opposite G, as well as A, and the excision efficiencies of fU for fU:G and fU:A pairs were comparable. In addition, MutS protein involved in methyl-directed mismatch repair also recognized fU:G mispairs and bound them with an efficiency comparable to T:G mispairs, but it did not recognize fU:A pairs. Prior complex formation between MutS and a heteroduplex containing an fU:G mispair inhibited the activity of AlkA to fU. These results suggest that fU present in DNA can be restored by two independent repair pathways, i.e. the base excision repair pathway initiated by AlkA and the methyl-directed mismatch repair pathway initiated by MutS. Biological relevance of the present results is discussed in light of DNA replication and repair in cells.

5-Formyluracil (fU) is a major thymine lesion produced by reactive oxygen radicals and photosensitized oxidation. We have previously shown that fU is a potentially mutagenic lesion due to its elevated frequency to mispair with guanine. Therefore, fU can exist in DNA as a correctly paired fU:A form or an incorrectly paired fU:G form. In this work, fU was site-specifically incorporated opposite A in oligonucleotide substrates to delineate the cellular repair mechanism of fU paired with A. The repair activity for fU was induced in Escherichia coli upon exposure to N-methyl-N'-nitro-N-nitrosoguanidine, and the induction was dependent on the alkA gene, suggesting that AlkA (3-methyladenine DNA glycosylase II) was responsible for the observed activity. Activity assay and determination of kinetic parameters using purified AlkA and defined oligonucleotide substrates containing fU, 5-hydroxymethyluracil (hU), or 7-methylguanine (7mG) revealed that fU was recognized by AlkA with an efficiency comparable to that of 7mG, a good substrate for AlkA, whereas hU, another major thymine methyl oxidation products, was not a substrate. (1)H and (13)C NMR chemical shifts of 5-formyl-2'-deoxyuridine indicated that the 5-formyl group caused base C-6 and sugar C-1' to be electron deficient, which was shown to result in destabilization of the N-glycosidic bond. These features are common in other good substrates for AlkA and are suggested to play key roles in the differential recognition of fU, hU, and intact thymine. Three mammalian repair enzymes for alkylated and oxidized bases cloned so far (MPG, Nth1, and OGG1) did not recognize fU, implying that the mammalian repair activity for fU resided on a yet unidentified protein. In the accompanying paper (Terato, H., Masaoka, A., Kobayashi, M., Fukushima, S., Ohyama, Y., Yoshida, M., and Ide, H., J. Biol. Chem. 274, 25144-25150), possible repair mechanisms for fU mispaired with G are reported.

The helix-hairpin-helix (HhH) superfamily of base excision repair DNA glycosylases is composed of multiple phylogenetically diverse enzymes that are capable of excising varying spectra of oxidatively and methyl-damaged bases. Although these DNA repair glycosylases have been widely studied through genetic, biochemical, and biophysical approaches, the evolutionary relationships of different HhH homologs and the extent to which they are conserved across phylogeny remain enigmatic. We provide an evolutionary framework for this pervasive and versatile superfamily of DNA glycosylases. Six HhH gene families (named AlkA: alkyladenine glycosylase; MpgII: N-methylpurine glycosylase II; MutY/Mig: A/G-specific adenine glycosylase/mismatch glycosylase; Nth: endonuclease III; OggI: 8-oxoguanine glycosylase I; and OggII: 8-oxoguanine glycosylase II) are identified through phylogenetic analysis of 234 homologs found in 94 genomes (16 archaea, 64 bacteria, and 14 eukaryotes). The number of homologs in each gene family varies from 117 in the Nth family (nearly every genome surveyed harbors at least one Nth homolog) to only five in the divergent OggII family (all from archaeal genomes). Sequences from all three domains of life are included in four of the six gene families, suggesting that the HhH superfamily diversified very early in evolution. The phylogeny provides evidence for multiple lineage-specific gene duplication events, most of which involve eukaryotic homologs in the Nth and AlkA gene families. We observe extensive variation in the number of HhH superfamily glycosylase genes present in different genomes, possibly reflecting major differences among species in the mechanisms and pathways by which damaged bases are repaired and/or disparities in the basic rates and spectra of mutation experienced by different genomes.

Adozelesin is a synthetic analog of the antitumor antibiotic CC-1065, which alkylates the N3 of adenine in the minor groove in a sequence-selective manner. Since the cytotoxic potency of a DNA alkylating agent can be modulated by DNA excision repair system, we investigated whether nucleotide excision repair (NER) and base excision repair (BER) enzymes are able to excise the bulky DNA adduct induced by adozelesin. The UvrABC nuclease and 3-methyladenine-DNA glycosylase, that exhibit a broad spectrum of substrate specificity, were selected as typical NER and BER enzymes, respectively. The adozelesin-DNA adduct was first formed in the radiolabeled restriction DNA fragment and its excision by purified repair enzymes was monitored on a DNA sequencing gel. The treatment of the DNA adduct with a purified UvrABC nuclease and sequencing gel analysis of cleaved DNA showed that UvrABC nuclease was able to incise the adozelesin adduct. The incision site corresponded to the general nuclease incision site. Excision of this adduct by 3-methyladenine-DNA glycosylases was determined following the treatment of the DNA adduct with a homogeneous recombinant bacterial, rat and human 3-methyladenine-DNA glycosylases. Abasic sites generated by DNA glycosyalses were cleaved by the associated lyase activity of the E. coli formamidopyrimidine-DNA glycosylase (Fpg). Resolution of cleaved DNA on a sequencing gel showed that the DNA glycosylase from different sources could not release the N3-adenine adducts. A cytotoxicity assay using E. coli repair mutant strains showed that E. coli mutant strains defective in the uvrA gene were more sensitive to cell killing by adozelesin than E. coli mutant strain defective in the alkA gene or the wild type. These results suggest that the NER pathway seems to be the major excision repair system in protecting cells from the cytotoxicity of adozelesin.

Reactive oxygen species, ionizing radiation, and other free radical generators initiate the conversion of guanine (G) residues in DNA to 8-oxoguanine (OG), which is highly mutagenic as it preferentially mispairs with adenine (A) during replication. Bacteria counter this threat with a multicomponent system that excises the lesion, corrects OG:A mispairs and cleanses the nucleotide precursor pool of dOGTP. Although biochemical evidence has suggested the existence of base-excision DNA repair proteins specific for OG in eukaryotes, little is known about these proteins. Using substrate-mimetic affinity chromatography followed by a mechanism-based covalent trapping procedure, we have isolated a base-excision DNA repair protein from Saccharomyces cerevisiae that processes OG opposite cytosine (OG:C) but acts only weakly on OG:A. A search of the yeast genome database using peptide sequences from the protein identified a gene, OGG1, encoding a predicted 43 kDa (376 amino acid) protein, identical to one identified independently by complementation cloning. Ogg1 has OG:C-specific base-excision DNA repair activity and also intrinsic beta-lyase activity, which proceeds through a Schiff base intermediate. Targeted disruption of the OGG1 gene in yeast revealed a second OG glycosylase/lyase protein, tentatively named Ogg2, which differs from Ogg1 in that it preferentially acts on OG:G. S. cerevisiae has two OG-specific glycosylase/lyases, which differ significantly in their preference for the base opposite the lesion. We suggest that one of these, Ogg1, is closely related in overall three-dimensional structure to Escherichia coli endonuclease III (endo III), a glycosylase/lyase that acts on fragmented and oxidatively damaged pyrimidines. We have recently shown that AlkA, a monofunctional DNA glycosylase that acts on alkylated bases, is structurally homologous to endo III. We have now identified a shared active site motif amongst these three proteins. Using this motif as a protein database searching tool, we find that it is present in a number of other base-excision DNA repair proteins that process diverse lesions. Thus, we propose the existence of a DNA glycosylase superfamily, members of which possess a common fold yet act upon remarkably diverse lesions, ranging from UV photoadducts to mismatches to alkylated or oxidized bases.

The Escherichia coli AlkA protein is a base excision repair glycosylase that removes a variety of alkylated bases from DNA. The 2.5 A crystal structure of AlkA complexed to DNA shows a large distortion in the bound DNA. The enzyme flips a 1-azaribose abasic nucleotide out of DNA and induces a 66 degrees bend in the DNA with a marked widening of the minor groove. The position of the 1-azaribose in the enzyme active site suggests an S(N)1-type mechanism for the glycosylase reaction, in which the essential catalytic Asp238 provides direct assistance for base removal. Catalytic selectivity might result from the enhanced stacking of positively charged, alkylated bases against the aromatic side chain of Trp272 in conjunction with the relative ease of cleaving the weakened glycosylic bond of these modified nucleotides. The structure of the AlkA-DNA complex offers the first glimpse of a helix-hairpin-helix (HhH) glycosylase complexed to DNA. Modeling studies suggest that other HhH glycosylases can bind to DNA in a similar manner.

The Escherichia coli 3-methyladenine DNA glycosylase II protein (AlkA) recognizes a broad range of oxidized and alkylated base lesions and catalyzes the hydrolysis of the N-glycosidic bond to initiate the base excision repair pathway. Although the enzyme was one of the first DNA repair glycosylases to be discovered more than 25 years ago and there are multiple crystal structures, the mechanism is poorly understood. Therefore, we have characterized the kinetic mechanism for the AlkA-catalyzed excision of the deaminated purine, hypoxanthine. The multiple-turnover glycosylase assays are consistent with Michaelis-Menten kinetics. However, under single-turnover conditions that are commonly employed for studying other DNA glycosylases, we observe an unusual biphasic protein saturation curve. Initially, the observed rate constant for excision increases with an increasing level of AlkA protein, but at higher protein concentrations, the rate constant decreases. This behavior can be most easily explained by tight binding to DNA ends and by crowding of multiple AlkA protamers on the DNA. Consistent with this model, crystal structures have shown the preferential binding of AlkA to DNA ends. By varying the position of the lesion, we identified an asymmetric substrate that does not show inhibition at higher concentrations of AlkA, and we performed pre-steady state and steady state kinetic analysis. Unlike the situation in other glycosylases, release of the abasic product is faster than N-glycosidic bond cleavage. Nevertheless, AlkA exhibits significant product inhibition under multiple-turnover conditions, and it binds approximately 10-fold more tightly to an abasic site than to a hypoxanthine lesion site. This tight binding could help protect abasic sites when the adaptive response to DNA alkylation is activated and very high levels of AlkA protein are present.

Methylating and ethylating agents are used in the chemical industry and produced during tobacco smoking. They generate DNA base damage whose role in cancer induction has been documented. Alkylated bases are repaired by the base excision repair pathway. We have established the repair efficiency of methylated and ethylated bases by various Escherichia coli repair proteins, namely 3-methyladenine-DNA-glycosylase I (TagA protein), which excises 3-methyladenine and 3-methylguanine, 3-methyladenine-DNA-glycosylase II (AlkA protein), which has a broad substrate specificity including 3- and 7-alkylated purines and the formamidopyrimidine(Fapy)-DNA-glycosylase (Fpg protein) repairing imidazole ring-opened 7-methylguanine. The comparison of the Km values of these various enzymes showed that methylated bases were excised more efficiently than ethylated bases. Several 3-alkyladenine derivatives have been synthesized and examined for their ability to inhibit the activity of the various repair proteins. We have shown that 3-ethyl-, 3-propyl-, 3-butyl- and 3-benzyladenine were much more efficient inhibitors of TagA protein than 3-methyladenine. The inhibitory effect was increased with the increase of the size of alkyl-group and IC50 for 3-benzyladenine was 0.4 +/- 0.1 microM as compared to 1.5 +/- 0.3 mM for 3-methyladenine. These compounds inhibited neither the AlkA protein nor human 3-methyladenine-DNA-glycosylase (ANPG protein). Moreover, 3-hydroxyethyladenine did not affect the activity of any of these enzymes. Taken together, these results suggest that hydrophobic interactions are involved in the mechanism of inhibition and/or recognition and excision of alkylated purines by TagA protein.

Schizosaccharomyces pombe has two paralogues of 3-methyladenine DNA glycosylase, Mag1p and Mag2p, which share homology with Escherichia coli AlkA. To clarify the function of these redundant enzymes in base excision repair (BER) of alkylation damage, we performed several genetic analyses. The mag1 and mag2 single mutants as well as the double mutant showed no obvious methyl methanesulfonate (MMS) sensitivity. Deletion of mag1 or mag2 from an nth1 mutant resulted in tolerance to MMS damage, indicating that both enzymes generate AP sites in vivo by removal of methylated bases. A rad16 mutant that is deficient in nucleotide excision repair (NER) exhibited moderate MMS sensitivity. Deletion of mag1 from the rad16 mutant greatly enhanced MMS sensitivity, and the mag2 deletion also weakened the resistance to MMS of the rad16 mutant. A mag1/mag2/rad16 triple mutant was most sensitive to MMS. These results suggest that the NER pathway obscures the mag1 and mag2 functions in MMS resistance and that both paralogues initiate the BER pathway of MMS-induced DNA damage at the same level in NER-deficient cells or that Mag2p tends to make a little lower contribution than Mag1p. Mag1p and Mag2p functioned additively in vivo. Expression of mag1 and mag2 in the triple mutant confirmed the contribution of Mag1p and Mag2p to BER of MMS resistance.

Base excision repair is initiated by DNA glycosylases removing inappropriate bases from DNA. One group of these enzymes, comprising 3-methyladenine DNA glycosylase II (AlkA) from Escherichia coli and related enzymes from other organisms, has been found to have an unusual broad specificity towards quite different base structures. We tested whether such enzymes might also be capable of removing normal base residues from DNA. The native enzymes from E.coli, Saccharomyces cerevisiae and human cells promoted release of intact guanines with significant frequencies, and further analysis of AlkA showed that all the normal bases can be removed. Transformation of E. coli with plasmids expressing different levels of AlkA produced an increased spontaneous mutation frequency correlated with the expression levels, indicating that excision of normal bases occurs at biologically significant rates. We propose that the broad specificity 3-methyladenine DNA glycosylases represent a general type of repair enzyme 'pulling' bases in DNA largely at random, without much preference for a specific structure. The specificity for release of damaged bases occurs because base structure alterations cause instability of the base-sugar bonds. Damaged bases are therefore released more readily than normal bases once the bond activation energy is reduced further by the enzyme. Qualitatively, the model correlates quite well with the relative rate of excision observed for most, if not all, of the substrates described for AlkA and analogues.

Human alkyladenine glycosylase (AAG) and Escherichia coli 3-methyladenine glycosylase (AlkA) are base excision repair glycosylases that recognize and excise a variety of alkylated bases from DNA. The crystal structures of these enzymes have provided insight into their substrate specificity and mechanisms of catalysis. Both enzymes utilize DNA bending and base-flipping mechanisms to expose and bind substrate bases. Crystal structures of AAG complexed to DNA suggest that the enzyme selects substrate bases through a combination of hydrogen bonding and the steric constraints of the active site, and that the enzyme activates a water molecule for an in-line backside attack of the N-glycosylic bond. In contrast to AAG, the structure of the AlkA-DNA complex suggests that AlkA substrate recognition and catalytic specificity are intimately integrated in a S(N)1 type mechanism in which the catalytic Asp238 directly promotes the release of modified bases.

Deamination of DNA bases can occur spontaneously, generating highly mutagenic lesions such as uracil and hypoxanthine. In Escherichia coli two enzymes initiate repair at hypoxanthine residues in DNA. The alkylbase DNA glycosylase, AlkA, initiates repair by removal of the damaged base, whereas endonuclease V, Endo V, hydrolyses the second phosphodiester bond 3' to the lesion. We have identified and characterised a mouse cDNA with striking homology to the E.coli nfi gene, which also has significant similarities to motifs required for catalytic activity of the UvrC endonuclease. The 37-kDa mouse enzyme (mEndo V) incises the DNA strand at the second phosphodiester bond 3' to hypoxanthine- and uracil-containing nucleotides. The activity of mEndo V is elevated on single-stranded DNA substrate in vitro. Expression of the mouse protein in a DNA repair-deficient E.coli alkA nfi strain suppresses its spontaneous mutator phenotype. We suggest that mEndo V initiates an alternative excision repair pathway for hypoxanthine removal. It thus appears that mEndo V has properties overlapping the function of alkylbase DNA glycosylase (Aag) in repair of deaminated adenine, which to some extent could explain the absence of phenotypic abnormalities associated with Aag knockout in mice.

DNA is constantly exposed to endogenous andexogenous alkylating agents that can modify its bases,resulting in mutagenesis in the absence of DNA repair [1,2]. Alkylation damage is removed by the action of DNA glycosylases, which initiate the base excision repair pathway and protect the sequence information of the genome [3-5]. We have identified a new class of methylpurine DNA glycosylase, designated MpgII, that is a member of the endonuclease III family of DNA repair enzymes. We expressed and purified MpgII from Thermotoga maritima and found that the enzyme releases both 7-methylguanine and 3-methyladenine from DNA. We cloned the MpgII genes from T. maritima and from Aquifex aeolicus and found that both genes could restore methylmethanesulfonate (MMS) resistance to Escherichia coli alkA tagA double mutants, which are deficient in the repair of alkylated bases. Analogous genes are found in other Bacteria and Archaea and appear to be the only genes coding for methylpurine DNA glycosylase activity in these organisms. MpgII is the fifth member of the endonuclease III family of DNA repair enzymes, suggesting that the endonuclease III protein scaffold has been modified during evolution to recognize and repair a variety of DNA damage.

In the base excision DNA repair pathway, DNA glycosylases recognize damaged bases in DNA and catalyze their excision through hydrolysis of the N-glycosidic bond. Attempts to understand the structural basis for DNA damage recognition by DNA glycosylases have been hampered by the short-lived association of these enzymes with their DNA substrates. To overcome this problem, we have employed an approach involving the design and synthesis of inhibitors that form stable complexes with DNA glycosylases, which can then be studied biochemically and structurally. We have previously reported that double-stranded DNA containing a pyrrolidine abasic site analog (PYR) forms an extremely stable complex with the DNA glycosylase AlkA and potently inhibits the reaction catalyzed by the enzyme (Schärer, O. D., Ortholand, J.-Y., Ganesan, A., Ezaz-Nikpay, K., and Verdine, G. L. (1995) J. Am. Chem. Soc. 117, 6623-6624). Here we investigate the interaction of this inhibitor with a variety of additional DNA glycosylases. With the exception of uracil DNA glycosylase all the glycosylases tested bind specifically to PYR-containing oligonucleotides. By comparing the interaction of DNA glycosylases with PYR and the structurally related tetrahydrofuran abasic site analog, we assess the importance of the positively charged ammonium group of the pyrrolidine in binding to the active site of these enzymes. Such a general inhibitor of DNA glycosyases provides a valuable tool to study stable complexes of these enzymes bound to substrate-like molecules.

A variety of alkylated base adducts are repaired by 3-methyladenine DNA glycosylases, one of the base excision repair enzymes. In this study, we examined the DNA adducts induced by hepsulfam and determined whether alkylated base adducts can be substrates for bacterial and mammalian 3-methyladenine DNA glycosylases by electrophoresis methods. Hepsulfam, a synthetic analogue of busulfan, is known to alkylate DNA and form interstrand cross-links. The extent of DNA interstrand cross-links induced by hepsulfam and busulfan was found to be similar but significantly lower than that induced by chlorambucil, as measured by an agarose gel assay. The major monofunctional alkylation site of hepsulfam was observed at the N7 position of guanine, and not at the N3 position of adenine. Both compounds did not exhibit any sequence selective DNA alkylation patterns. The excision of hepsulfam-induced DNA adducts has been determined by treatment with homogeneous recombinant bacterial, rat and human 3-methyladenine DNA glycosylases and successive treatments by formamidopyrimidine-DNA glycosylase. The Escherichia coli alkA protein was shown to completely excise N7 guanine adducts, whereas mammalian 3-methyladenine DNA glycosylase failed to excise them. In addition, the cytotoxicity assay showed that E. coli mutant strains defective in the alkA gene or the uvrA gene were more sensitive to killing by hepsulfam than the wild type.

The role of base excision repair in the repair of alkylation damage produced by a series of sequence specific oligopyrrole-containing analogues of distamycin A that tether benzoic acid mustard (BAM) has been examined. Whereas BAM alkylates and cross-links in the major groove of DNA, attachment to pyrrole units produces monoalkylations in the minor groove of DNA at AT tracts. Both sequence specificity of alkylation and cytotoxicity increase from one to three attached pyrrole units (compounds 1-3), and with 3 alkylation is selective for purine-N3 in the sequence 5'-TTTTGPu (where Pu = guanine or adenine). In a model bacterial (Escherichia coli) system repair of the sequence specific minor groove alkylations produced by 2 and 3 does not appear to involve BER, since neither a formamidopyrimidine-DNA glycosylase repair deficient E. coli mutant (BH 20, fpg- mutant) nor a 3-methyladenine-DNA glycosylase repair deficient mutant (GC 4803, tag-alkA- mutant) showed increased cytotoxicity to 2 or 3 compared with the wild type, AB 1157. The monopyrrole compound 1 was, however, approximately 4-fold more cytotoxic to the GC 4803 mutant compared with wild type and BH 20, suggesting a role for the 3-methyladenine-DNA glycosylase in the recognition and excision of the adducts formed by 1. In contrast, increased sensitivity (> 10-fold) was observed for the conventional nitrogen mustard BAM in the BH 20 strain, suggesting a role for the formamidopyrimidine-DNA glycosylase in the repair of the lesions produced by the agent. In a cell-free system the E. coli 3-methyladenine-DNA glycosylase (AlkA) was shown to remove alkylations at 5'-TTTTGPu sequences. However, the efficiency in removing the adducts formed by the oligopyrrole compounds decreased dramatically from compound 1 to compound 3. Increasing the size of the DNA adduct formed in the minor groove therefore decreased the efficiency of recognition and removal of the adduct by the DNA glycosylase.

Base excision repair of DNA alkylation damage is initiated by a methylpurine DNA glycosylase (MPG) function. Such enzymes have previously been characterized from bacteria and eukarya, but not from archaea. We identified activity for the release of methylated bases from DNA in cell-free extracts of Archaeoglobus fulgidus, an archaeon growing optimally at 83 degrees C. An open reading frame homologous to the alkA gene of Escherichia coli was overexpressed and identified as a gene encoding an MPG enzyme (M(r) = 34 251), hereafter designated afalkA. The purified AfalkA protein differs from E. coli AlkA by excising alkylated bases only, from DNA, in the following order of efficiency: 3-methyladenine (m(3)A) >> 3-methylguanine approximately 7-methyladenine >> 7-methylguanine. Although the rate of enzymatic release of m(3)A is highest in the temperature range of 65-75 degrees C, it is only reduced by 50% at 45 degrees C, a temperature that does not support growth of A. fulgidus. At temperatures above 75 degrees C, nonenzymatic release of methylpurines predominates. The results suggest that the biological function of AfalkA is to excise m(3)A from DNA at suboptimal and maybe even mesophilic temperatures. This hypothesis is further supported by the observation that the afalkA gene function suppresses the alkylation sensitivity of the E. coli tag alkA double mutant. The amino acid sequence similarity and evolutionary relationship of AfalkA with other MPG enzymes from the three domains of life are described and discussed.

3-Methyladenine DNA glycosylase II (AlkA) is a DNA-repair enzyme that removes alkylated bases in DNA via the base-excision repair (BER) pathway. The enzyme belongs to the helix-hairpin-helix (HhH) superfamily of DNA glycosylases and possesses broad substrate specificity. In the genome of Deinococcus radiodurans, two genes encoding putative AlkA have been identified (Dr_2074 and Dr_2584). Dr_2074 is a homologue of human AlkA (MPG or AAG) and Dr_2584 is a homologue of bacterial AlkAs. Here, the three-dimensional structure of Dr_2584 (DrAlkA2) is presented and compared with the previously determined structure of Escherichia coli AlkA (EcAlkA). The results show that the enzyme consists of two helical-bundle domains separated by a wide DNA-binding cleft and contains an HhH motif. Overall, the protein fold is similar to the two helical-bundle domains of EcAlkA, while the third N-terminal mixed α/β domain observed in EcAlkA is absent. Substrate-specificity analyses show that DrAlkA2, like EcAlkA, is able to remove both 3-methyladenine (3meA) and 7-methylguanine (7meG) from DNA; however, the enzyme possesses no activity towards 1,N(6)-ethenoadenine (ℇA) and hypoxanthine (Hx). In addition, it shows activity towards the AlkB dioxygenase substrates 3-methylcytosine (3meC) and 1-methyladenine (1meA). Thus, the enzyme seems to preferentially repair methylated bases with weakened N-glycosidic bonds; this is an unusual specificity for a bacterial AlkA protein and is probably dictated by a combination of the wide DNA-binding cleft and a highly accessible specificity pocket.

Alkylating agents are widespread in the environment and also occur endogenously. They can be cytotoxic or mutagenic to the cells introducing alkylated bases to DNA or RNA. All organisms have evolved multiple DNA repair mechanisms to counteract the effects of DNA alkylation: the most cytotoxic lesion, N(3)-methyladenine (3meA), is excised by AlkA glycosylase initiating base excision repair (BER); toxic N(1)-methyladenine (1meA) and N(3)-methylcytosine (3meC), induced in DNA and RNA, are removed by AlkB dioxygenase; and mutagenic and cytotoxic O(6)-methylguanine (O(6) meG) is repaired by Ada methyltransferase. In Escherichia coli, Ada response involves the expression of four genes, ada, alkA, alkB, and aidB, encoding respective proteins Ada, AlkA, AlkB, and AidB. The Ada response is conserved among many bacterial species; however, it can be organized differently, with diverse substrate specificity of the particular proteins. Here, an overview of the organization of the Ada regulon and function of individual proteins is presented. We put special effort into the characterization of AlkB dioxygenases, their substrate specificity, and function in the repair of alkylation lesions in DNA/RNA.
