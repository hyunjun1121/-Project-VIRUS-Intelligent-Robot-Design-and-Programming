Inhibition of antigen-dependent B-cell receptor (BCR) signaling is considered a promising therapeutic approach in chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL), but experimental in vivo evidence to support this view is still lacking. We have now investigated whether inhibition of BCR signaling with the selective Syk inhibitor fostamatinib disodium (R788) will affect the growth of the leukemias that develop in the Eμ-TCL1 transgenic mouse model of CLL. Similarly to human CLL, these leukemias express stereotyped BCRs that react with autoantigens exposed on the surface of senescent or apoptotic cells, suggesting that they are antigen driven. We show that R788 effectively inhibits BCR signaling in vivo, resulting in reduced proliferation and survival of the malignant B cells and significantly prolonged survival of the treated animals. The growth-inhibitory effect of R788 occurs despite the relatively modest cytotoxic effect in vitro and is independent of basal Syk activity, suggesting that R788 functions primarily by inhibiting antigen-dependent BCR signals. Importantly, the effect of R788 was found to be selective for the malignant clones, as no disturbance in the production of normal B lymphocytes was observed. Collectively, these data provide further rationale for clinical trials with R788 in CLL and establish the BCR-signaling pathway as an important therapeutic target in this disease.

Chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) is a malignancy of mature B cells that depend on host factors in the tissue microenvironment for survival and proliferation. In vitro, CLL cells rapidly undergo apoptosis unless microenvironmental factors are provided that support their survival. Signaling pathways activated in the microenvironment in vivo include the B-cell receptor (BCR) and NF-κB pathways. Thus, CLL is a disease "addicted to the host" and is dependent on pathways that promote normal B-cell development, expansion, and survival; this is particularly true in the case of the BCR signaling cascade. Small-molecule inhibitors of kinases that are essential for BCR signal transduction abrogate the stimulating effects of the microenvironment on CLL cells. The orally administered tyrosine kinase inhibitors fostamatinib and ibrutinib and the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase inhibitor GS-1101 have induced impressive responses in relapsed and refractory CLL patients, mostly with moderate side effects. Reductions in lymphadenopathy and splenomegaly are seen within weeks and are frequently accompanied by a transient rise in absolute lymphocyte count that is asymptomatic and probably the result of changes in CLL cell trafficking. This review discusses the biologic basis for kinase inhibitors as targeted therapy of CLL and summarizes the exciting early clinical experience with these agents.

Spleen tyrosine kinase (Syk) is involved in the development of the adaptive immune system and has been recognized as being important in the function of additional cell types, including platelets, phagocytes, fibroblasts, and osteoclasts, and in the generation of the inflammasome. Preclinical studies presented compelling evidence that Syk inhibition may have therapeutic value in the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis and other forms of arthritis, systemic lupus erythematosus, autoimmune cytopenias, and allergic and autoinflammatory diseases. In addition, Syk inhibition may have a place in limiting tissue injury associated with organ transplant and revascularization procedures. Clinical trials have documented exciting success in the treatment of patients with rheumatoid arthritis, autoimmune cytopenias, and allergic rhinitis. While the extent and severity of side effects appear to be limited so far, larger studies will unravel the risk involved with the clinical benefit.

Spleen tyrosine kinase (Syk) is an important modulator of immune signaling. The objective of this phase 2 study was to evaluate the efficacy and safety of R788, an oral inhibitor of Syk, in patients with active rheumatoid arthritis despite methotrexate therapy. We enrolled 457 patients who had active rheumatoid arthritis despite long-term methotrexate therapy in a 6-month, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial. The primary outcome was the American College of Rheumatology (ACR) 20 response (which indicates at least a 20% reduction in the number of both tender and swollen joints and improvement in at least three of five other criteria) at month 6. R788, at a dose of 100 mg twice daily and at a dose of 150 mg once daily, was significantly superior to placebo at month 6 (ACR 20 response rates of 67% and 57%, respectively, vs. 35%; P<0.001 for the comparison of both doses with placebo). It was also significantly superior with respect to ACR 50, which indicates at least a 50% improvement (43% and 32% vs. 19%; P<0.001 for the comparison of the 100-mg dose with placebo, P=0.007 for the comparison of the 150-mg dose with placebo) and ACR 70 (28% and 14% vs. 10%; P<0.001 for the comparison of the 100-mg dose with placebo, P=0.34 for the comparison of the 150-mg dose with placebo). A clinically significant effect was noted by the end of the first week of treatment. Adverse effects included diarrhea (in 19% of subjects taking the 100-mg dose of R788 vs. 3% of those taking placebo), upper respiratory infections (14% vs. 7%), and neutropenia (6% vs. 1%). R788 was associated with an increase in systolic blood pressure of approximately 3 mm Hg between baseline and month 1, as compared with a decrease of 2 mm Hg with placebo; 23% of the patients taking R788 vs. 7% of the patients receiving placebo required the initiation of or a change in antihypertensive therapy. In this phase 2 study, a Syk inhibitor reduced disease activity in patients with rheumatoid arthritis; adverse events included diarrhea, hypertension, and neutropenia. Additional studies will be needed to further assess the safety and efficacy of Syk-inhibition therapy in patients with rheumatoid arthritis.

Biological products have proven its high efficacy on autoimmune disease such as rheumatoid arthritis (RA) and systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE). Meanwhile, small molecular drugs have attracted attention over the years because of its availability of oral administration and cost effectiveness. Spleen tyrosine kinase (Syk) is a 72 kDa protein tyrosine kinase widely expressed on cells that are involved in the immune system and inflammation such as B cells, T cells, macrophages and synovial fibroblast. Syk is involved in intracellular signaling of the multi-chain immune receptors, including B cell receptor (BCR), ζchain of T-cell receptor (TCR), FcR and integrins, which contains the immune-receptor tyrosine-based activation motif (ITAM). Recently, Syk inhibitor fostamatinib has exerted potent therapeutic efficacy against autoimmune and allergic diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis (RA), bronchial asthma and thrombocytopenic purpura (ITP). Moreover, Syk blockade prevented the development of skin and kidney lesions in lupus-prone mice, however the mechanism of action is unclear. We have revealed that Syk-mediated BCR-signaling is prerequisite for optimal induction of toll-like receptor (TLR)-9, thereby allowing efficient propagation of CD40- and TLR9- signaling in human B cells. These results indicate that inhibition of Syk have a potential to regulate B-cell mediated inflammatory diseases such as SLE. We here document the in vitro and in vivo effects of a Syk inhibitor for the treatment of autoimmune diseases, mainly in RA and SLE.

Current research in lymphoma is focused on two areas of lymphoma biology-the signal transduction pathways used to maintain the growth of malignant lymphocytes and the role of the tumor microenvironment in lymphoma growth and survival. This review focuses on three signaling pathways: the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase/mammalian target of rapamycin (PI3K/mTOR) pathway, the B-cell receptor/spleen tyrosine kinase (BCR/Syk) pathway, and the protein kinase C-beta (PKC-β) pathway, known to be important to lymphoma cells. The mTOR inhibitors temsirolimus and everolimus have demonstrated antitumor activity in all types of lymphoma, the Syk inhibitor fostamatinib has activity in diffuse large B-cell lymphoma and chronic lymphocytic leukemia, and the PKC-β inhibitor enzastaurin is being used as consolidation therapy after remission in diffuse large B-cell lymphoma. This review discusses the biology behind the development of each new agent and the results of initial clinical trials. The goal is to provide the hematologist/oncologist background information on these new agents and understand their current and potential role in the management of patients.

A novel approach to design selective spleen tyrosine kinase (Syk) inhibitors is described. Inhibition of spleen tyrosine kinase has attracted much attention as a mechanism for the treatment of autoimmune diseases such as asthma, rheumatoid arthritis, and SLE. Fostamatinib, a Syk inhibitor that successfully completed phase II clinical trials, also exhibits some undesirable side effects. More selective Syk inhibitors could offer safer, alternative treatments. Through a systematic evaluation of the kinome, we identified Pro455 and Asn457 in the Syk ATP binding site as a rare combination among sequence aligned kinases and hypothesized that optimizing the interaction between them and a Syk inhibitor molecule would impart high selectivity for Syk over other kinases. We report the structure-guided identification of three series of selective spleen tyrosine kinase inhibitors that support our hypothesis and offer useful guidance to other researchers in the field.

To assess the influence of fostamatinib on patient-reported outcomes (PRO) in patients with active rheumatoid arthritis and an inadequate response to methotrexate (MTX). Patients taking background MTX (N = 457) were enrolled in a phase II clinical trial (NCT00665925) and randomized equally to placebo, fostamatinib 100 mg twice daily (bid), or fostamatinib 150 mg once daily (qd) for 24 weeks. Self-administered PRO measures included pain, patient's global assessment (PtGA) of disease activity, physical function, health-related quality of life (HRQOL), and fatigue. Mean change from baseline and a responder analysis of the proportion of patients achieving a minimal clinically important difference were determined. At Week 24, there were statistically significant improvements in pain, PtGA, physical function, fatigue, and the physical component summary of the Medical Outcomes Study Short Form-36 (SF-36) for fostamatinib 100 mg bid compared with placebo. Mean (standard error) changes from baseline in the fostamatinib 100 mg bid group versus the placebo group were -31.3 (2.45) versus -17.8 (2.45), p < 0.001 for pain; -29.1 (2.26) versus -16.7 (2.42), p < 0.001 for PtGA; -0.647 (0.064) versus -0.343 (0.062), p < 0.001 for physical function; 7.40 (1.00) versus 4.50 (0.94), p < 0.05 for fatigue; 8.52 (0.77) versus 4.90 (0.78), p < 0.01 for SF-36 physical component score; and 3.99 (0.93) versus 3.71 (0.99), p = 0.83 for SF-36 mental component score. Patients receiving fostamatinib 150 mg qd showed improvements in some PRO, including physical function. Patients treated with fostamatinib 100 mg bid showed significant improvements in HRQOL outcomes.

Mantle cell lymphoma (MCL) is currently an incurable entity, and new therapeutic approaches are needed. We have applied a high-throughput phospho-proteomic technique to MCL cell lines to identify activated pathways and we have then validated our data in both cell lines and tumor tissues. PhosphoScan analysis was performed on MCL cell lines. Results were validated by flow cytometry and western blotting. Functional validation was performed by blocking the most active pathway in MCL cell lines. PhosphoScan identified more than 300 tyrosine-phosporylated proteins, among which many protein kinases. The most abundant peptides belonged to proteins connected with B-cell receptor (BCR) signaling. Active BCR signaling was demonstrated by flow cytometry in MCL cells and by western blotting in MCL tumor tissues. Blocking BCR signaling by Syk inhibitor piceatannol induced dose/time-dependent apoptosis in MCL cell lines, as well as several modifications in the phosphorylation status of BCR pathway members and a collapse of cyclin D1 protein levels. Our data support a pro-survival role of BCR signaling in MCL and suggest that this pathway might be a candidate for therapy. Our findings also suggest that Syk activation patterns might be different in MCL compared to other lymphoma subtypes.

Syk is a protein tyrosine kinase that couples B-cell receptor (BCR) activation with downstream signaling pathways, affecting cell survival and proliferation. Moreover, Syk is involved in BCR-independent functions, such as B-cell migration and adhesion. In chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL), Syk becomes activated by external signals from the tissue microenvironment, and was targeted in a first clinical trial with R788 (fostamatinib), a relatively nonspecific Syk inhibitor. Here, we characterize the activity of two novel, highly selective Syk inhibitors, PRT318 and P505-15, in assays that model CLL interactions with the microenvironment. PRT318 and P505-15 effectively antagonize CLL cell survival after BCR triggering and in nurse-like cell-co-cultures. Moreover, they inhibit BCR-dependent secretion of the chemokines CCL3 and CCL4 by CLL cells, and leukemia cell migration toward the tissue homing chemokines CXCL12, CXCL13, and beneath stromal cells. PRT318 and P505-15 furthermore inhibit Syk and extracellular signal-regulated kinase phosphorylation after BCR triggering. These findings demonstrate that the selective Syk inhibitors PRT318 and P505-15 are highly effective for inhibition of CLL survival and tissue homing circuits, and support the therapeutic development of these agents in patients with CLL, other B-cell malignancies and autoimmune disorders.

The outlook for patients with rheumatoid arthritis has improved significantly over the last three decades with the use of disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs. However, despite the use of methotrexate, cytokine inhibitors, and molecules targeting T and B cells, a percentage of patients do not respond or lose their response over time. The autoimmune process in rheumatoid arthritis depends on activation of immune cells, which utilize intracellular kinases to respond to external stimuli such as cytokines, immune complexes, and antigens. In the past decade, small molecules targeting several kinases, such as p38 MAPK, Syk, and JAK have been developed. Several p38 MAPK inhibitors proved ineffective in treating rheumatoid arthritis. The Syk inhibitor, fostamatinib, proved superior to placebo in Phase II trials and is currently under Phase III investigation. Tofacitinib, a JAK1/3 inhibitor, was shown to be efficacious in two Phase III trials, while VX-509, a JAK3 inhibitor, showed promising results in a Phase II trial. Fostamatinib and tofacitinib were associated with increased rates of infection, elevation of liver enzymes, and neutropenia. Moreover, fostamatinib caused elevations of blood pressure and diarrhea, while tofacitinib was associated with an increase in creatinine and elevation of lipid levels.

Registries estimate that one third of patients with psoriatic arthritis (PsA) are "resistant" to of TNF-alpha blockers. Therefore, the search for new approaches to treatment of this disease may be justified. Currently the treatment options that have proven effective are associated with inhibition of the T cell costimulatory pathway (abatacept and alefacept) and blocking the P40 fraction of IL-12 and IL-23 (ustekinumab). A novel pathway inhibition, which deserves special attention is offered by apremilast. This molecule inhibits phosphodiesterase IV, responsible for hydrolyzing cyclic adenosine monophosphate to adenosine monophosphate, which causes an increase in cAMP. This metabolite is associated with decreased TNF-alpha. It has a modest efficacy (ACR 20 response of 43%), and subsequent studies have shown an improvement in visual analog scale and the SF36 compared to placebo. Currently there are five clinical trials in phase III to assess its effectiveness in parameters of inflammation and radiographic progression. The spectrum of possibilities before treatment failure with anti-TNF alpha, is augmented by the appearance of several reports that show efficacy with the individual use of CD20 inhibitors and IL-1. In patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA) the effectiveness of molecules that inhibit signal transduction of cytokines (Anti-JAK) has been proven, so it is possible that in the future they may be used in patients with PsA.

Spleen tyrosine kinase (SYK) has come into focus as a potential therapeutic target in chronic inflammatory diseases, such as rheumatoid arthritis and asthma, as well as in B-cell lymphomas. SYK has also been involved in the signaling of immunoreceptors, cytokine receptors, and integrins. We therefore hypothesized that inhibition of SYK attenuates the inflammatory process underlying atherosclerosis and reduces plaque development. Low-density lipoprotein receptor-deficient mice consuming a high-cholesterol diet supplemented with 2 doses of the orally available SYK inhibitor fostamatinib for 16 weeks showed a dose-dependent reduction in atherosclerotic lesion size by up to 59±6% compared with the respective controls. Lesions of fostamatinib-treated animals contained fewer macrophages but more smooth muscle cells and collagen-characteristics associated with more stable plaques in humans. Mechanistically, fostamatinib attenuated adhesion and migration of inflammatory cells and limited macrophage survival. Furthermore, fostamatinib normalized high-cholesterol diet -induced monocytosis and inflammatory gene expression. We present the novel finding that the SYK inhibitor fostamatinib attenuates atherogenesis in mice. Our data identify SYK inhibition as a potentially fruitful antiinflammatory therapeutic strategy in atherosclerosis.

The B-cell receptor (BCR) delivers antigen-dependent and -independent signals that have been implicated in the pathogenesis of several common B-cell malignancies. Agents that can efficiently block BCR signaling have recently been developed and are currently being evaluated as novel targeted therapies. Among these, agents that inhibit the Syk kinase appear particularly promising in preclinical and early clinical studies. The manuscript provides an overview of recent findings that implicate Syk and the BCR signaling pathway in the pathogenesis of several common lymphoid malignancies. It outlines preclinical and early clinical experiences with the Syk inhibitor fostamatinib disodium (R788) and discusses various options for further clinical development of this compound. Inhibitors of Syk or other components of the BCR signaling pathway are emerging as an exciting novel class of agents for the treatment of common B-cell malignancies. Future efforts should focus on defining the disease entities that are most likely to benefit from these agents, although considerable evidence is already available to pursue such studies in patients with chronic lymphocytic leukemia. Combinations with chemo-immunotherapy, treatment of early-stage disease and consolidation therapy should all be explored and could lead to the development of novel therapeutic approaches with improved efficacy, tolerability and toxicity profiles.

Fostamatinib (R788) is being investigated as an add-on therapy for the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis (RA) in patients with inadequate response to methotrexate (MTX). This study evaluated the potential pharmacokinetic interaction between R788 and MTX. Sixteen RA subjects on a stable weekly MTX regimen were enrolled and received MTX on days 1 and 8. Twelve subjects received 100 mg of R788 orally, and 4 subjects received a matching placebo twice daily from days 4 to 8 and once daily on days 3 and 9. Blood samples were collected on days 1 and 8 for MTX and 7-hydroxymethotrexate (7-OH-MTX), and days 3 and 9 for R788 and its active metabolite, R406. MTX and 7-OH-MTX pharmacokinetic parameters were similar on days 1 and 8. In the R788 group, the mean day 8 to day 1 ratios (90% confidence intervals) of maximum concentration and area under the plasma concentration-time curve estimates were 1.01 (0.85-1.20) and 1.12 (0.90-1.40) for MTX and 1.06 (0.82-1.35) and 1.06 (0.83-1.36) for 7-OH-MTX, respectively. Urinary excretion of MTX and 7-OH-MTX was also similar with or without R788, averaging 58% to 69% and 4% to 5% of the MTX dose, respectively. The data suggest that there is no clinically significant pharmacokinetic interaction of R788 and MTX in RA patients.

Tissue injury following ischemia-reperfusion (I/R) occurs as a consequence of actions of soluble factors and immune cells. Growing evidence supports a role for platelets in the manifestation of tissue damage following I/R. Spleen tyrosine kinase has been well documented to be important in lymphocyte activation and more recently in platelet activation. We performed experiments to evaluate whether inhibition of platelet activation through inhibition of spleen tyrosine kinase prevents tissue damage after mesenteric I/R injury. Platelets isolated from C57BL/6J mice fed with R788 for 10 days were transfused into C57BL/6J mice depleted of platelets 2 days before mesenteric I/R injury. Platelet-depleted mice transfused with platelets from R788-treated mice before mesenteric I/R displayed a significant reduction in the degree of remote lung damage, but with little change in the degree of local intestinal damage compared with control I/R mice. Transfusion of R788-treated platelets also decreased platelet sequestration, C3 deposition, and immunoglobulin deposition in lung, but not in the intestine, compared with control groups. These findings demonstrate that platelet activation is a requisite for sequestration in the pulmonary vasculature to mediate remote tissue injury after mesenteric I/R. The use of small-molecule inhibitors may be valuable to prevent tissue damage in remote organs following I/R injury.

In APCs, the protein tyrosine kinase Syk is required for signaling of several immunoreceptors, including the BCR and FcR. We show that conditional ablation of the syk gene in dendritic cells (DCs) abrogates FcgammaR-mediated cross priming of diabetogenic T cells in RIP-mOVA mice, a situation phenocopied in wild-type RIP-mOVA mice treated with the selective Syk inhibitor R788. In addition to blocking FcgammaR-mediated events, R788 also blocked BCR-mediated Ag presentation, thus broadly interrupting the humoral contributions to T cell-driven autoimmunity. Indeed, oral administration of R788 significantly delayed spontaneous diabetes onset in NOD mice and successfully delayed progression of early-established diabetes even when treatment was initiated after the development of glucose intolerance. At the DC level, R788 treatment was associated with reduced insulin-specific CD8 priming and decreased DC numbers. At the B cell level, R788 reduced total B cell numbers and total Ig concentrations. Interestingly, R788 increased the number of IL-10-producing B cells, thus inducing a tolerogenic B cell population with immunomodulatory activity. Taken together, we show by genetic and pharmacologic approaches that Syk in APCs is an attractive target in T cell-mediated autoimmune diseases such as type 1 diabetes.

Acute graft-versus-host disease (GvHD) limits the applicability of allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation for the treatment of leukemia. GvHD occurs as a consequence of multiple activating events in antigen-presenting cells (APCs) and T cells (Tcs). Spleen tyrosine kinase (Syk) is an intracellular non-receptor tyrosine kinase involved in multiple signaling events of immune cells. Therefore, we hypothesized that Syk may be a promising target to inhibit GvHD, which involves activation of different immune cell populations. In vivo expansion of luciferase(+) donor Tcs in mice developing GvHD was reduced by treatment with the Syk inhibitor Fostamatinib, which led to increased survival and reduced histologically confirmed GvHD severity. Importantly, in vivo and in vitro cytotoxicity against leukemia target cells and anti-murine cytomegalovirus immune responses were not impacted by Fostamatinib. In APCs Syk inhibition reduced the expression of costimulatory molecules and disrupted cytoskeletal organization with consecutive APC migratory defects in vitro and in vivo while phagocytic activity remained intact. On the basis of these immunomodulatory effects on different cell populations, we conclude that Syk targeting in alloantigen-activated Tcs and APCs with pharmacologic inhibitors, already applied successfully in anti-lymphoma therapy, has clinical potential to reduce GvHD, especially as anti-leukemia and anti-viral immunity were preserved.

Fostamatinib (R788) is a prodrug rapidly converted to its active metabolite on oral administration. This (known as R406) is a potent inhibitor of spleen tyrosine kinase, required for the expression of a number of proinflammatory cytokines. Fostamatinib has shown significantly superior efficacy (when compared with placebo) in the control of patients with rheumatoid arthritis not responding to methotrexate in Phase II clinical trials. Treatment emergent adverse events with a higher frequency than in those on placebo included diarrhea, hypertension, urinary tract infections, neutropenia and elevated transaminases. The studied doses have shown a linear pharmacokinetic pattern and the administration of methotrexate does not affect it. Fostamatinib may have a role in the therapy of patients with rheumatoid arthritis with poor response to conventional therapy. If these results are confirmed once Phase III studies are completed, it may find a place in the evolving treatment algorithm for rheumatoid arthritis.

Reperfusion injury to tissue following an ischemic event occurs as a consequence of an acute inflammatory response that can cause significant morbidity and mortality. Components of both the innate (complement, immunoglobulin, monocytes, and neutrophils) and adaptive (B and T lymphocytes) immune systems have been demonstrated to mediate tissue injury. Spleen tyrosine kinase (Syk) is responsible for membrane-mediated signaling in various cell types including B lymphocytes, macrophages, and T cells. We investigated the ability of a small drug Syk inhibitor, R788, to protect mice against mesenteric ischemia-reperfusion (I/R)-induced local (intestine) and remote lung injury. Mice were fed with chow containing a Syk inhibitor for 6 days before the performance of intestinal I/R, which resulted in silencing of the expression of the active phosphorylated Syk. Syk inhibition significantly suppressed both local and remote lung injury. The beneficial effect was associated with reduced IgM and complement 3 deposition in the tissues and significant reduction of polymorphonuclear cell infiltration. Our data place Syk upstream of events leading to the binding of natural antibodies to the ischemia-conditioned tissues and urge the consideration of the use of Syk inhibitors in the prevention or improvement of tissue injury of organs exposed to ischemia or hypoperfusion.

Rigel Pharmaceuticals Inc is developing fostamatinib, a prodrug of the spleen tyrosine kinase (Syk) inhibitor R-406, for the potential treatment of autoimmune diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis (RA), idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura (ITP) and B-cell lymphomas. Syk is a key mediator of Fc and B-cell receptor signaling in inflammatory cells, such as B-cells, mast cells, macrophages and neutrophils. Preclinical studies of R-406 or fostamatinib demonstrated a significant reduction in major inflammatory mediators such as TNFalpha, IL-1, IL-6 and IL-18, leading to reduced inflammation and bone degradation in models of RA. In a phase II clinical trial, fostamatinib treatment effectively improved American College of Rheumatology response rates in patients with RA. Preclinical studies and phase II trials also suggested the potential of using fostamatinib for the treatment of ITP and B-cell lymphomas, by increasing platelet counts and inducing response rates, respectively. Fostamatinib is orally bioavailable and was well tolerated in phase I and II trials, with the most common side effect being gastrointestinal symptoms. At the time of publication, phase II trials for fostamatinib were ongoing in patients with RA, ITP and B-cell lymphomas. The Syk inhibitor appears to be a promising therapeutic for immunological diseases, but further data are required to establish the efficacy and long-term safety of the drug in humans.

Tyrosine kinases (TK) are enzymes capable of transferring phosphate groups to tyrosine residues in cytoplasmic proteins or the intracellular domains of transmembrane receptors. TK play critical roles in diverse biological functions including cellular processes such as adhesion, motility, proliferation, cell cycle control, cell death, as well as biological functions at the whole-organism level such as growth and development, metabolism or immune defense. TK inhibitors including spleen TK (fostamatinib) and Janus kinases (tofacitinib) inhibitors are two novel oral therapies that have demonstrated short-term good clinical responses in active rheumatoid arthritis patients with and inadequate responses to methotrexate or other traditional (non-biologic) disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs (DMARDs). Those responses are comparable to responses rates from pivotal trials of TNF inhibitors. TK inhibitors are generally well tolerated but not free of adverse effects. Several side effects had been described including gastrointestinal symptoms, neutropenia, hypertension, elevated liver function test and lipid alterations among others. Owing to the limited duration of follow-up of patients treated with TK inhibitors, the long term safety profile of these drugs are unknown.

To assess the efficacy and safety of R788 (fostamatinib disodium), an inhibitor of spleen tyrosine kinase (Syk), in patients with active rheumatoid arthritis (RA) that did not respond to biologic therapies. A total of 219 patients with active RA in whom treatment with biologic agents had failed were enrolled in a 3-month multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial of R788. The primary end point was the percentage of patients who met the American College of Rheumatology 20% improvement criteria (achieved an ACR20 response) at month 3. Secondary end points included changes in inflammation and damage, as assessed by magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), and changes in the Disease Activity Score. The ACR20 response in the R788 100 mg twice daily group was 38%, versus 37% in the placebo group, at month 3. No significant differences were achieved in the ACR20, ACR50, or ACR70 response levels at 3 months. There were differences between the groups from baseline to month 3 in the secondary end points C-reactive protein (CRP) level and synovitis score on MRI. There were baseline differences in steroid use, prior biologic use, and synovitis score on MRI between the R788 group and the placebo group that may have affected the outcomes. A high placebo response rate was seen in this trial, and exploratory analysis suggested that this may in part have been driven by patients who entered the trial with an elevated erythrocyte sedimentation rate but normal CRP level. Our findings indicate that there were no differences in the primary end point between the R788 and placebo groups. Differences were observed between the R788 and placebo groups in secondary end points, particularly in those patients who entered the study with an elevated CRP level.

Three major advances over the last decade have impacted the way we treat rheumatoid arthritis; early and aggressive treatment, use of disease activity measures leading to treat to target, and availability of biologic agents. No oral biologic agents are available at this time but promising data is emerging for two drugs, tofacitinib and fostamatinib, inhibitors of JAK and Syk kinases, respectively. This paper will review some of the relevant published data for these agents and discuss where they may be placed in our treatment options for RA.

Certain malignant B cells rely on B-cell receptor (BCR)-mediated survival signals. Spleen tyrosine kinase (Syk) initiates and amplifies the BCR signal. In in vivo analyses of B-cell lymphoma cell lines and primary tumors, Syk inhibition induces apoptosis. These data prompted a phase 1/2 clinical trial of fostamatinib disodium, the first clinically available oral Syk inhibitor, in patients with recurrent B-cell non-Hodgkin lymphoma (B-NHL). Dose-limiting toxicity in the phase 1 portion was neutropenia, diarrhea, and thrombocytopenia, and 200 mg twice daily was chosen for phase 2 testing. Sixty-eight patients with recurrent B-NHL were then enrolled in 3 cohorts: (1) diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL), (2) follicular lymphoma (FL), and (3) other NHL, including mantle cell lymphoma (MCL), marginal zone lymphoma (MZL), mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue lymphoma, lymphoplasmacytic lymphomas, and small lymphocytic leukemia/chronic lymphocytic leukemia (SLL/CLL). Common toxicities included diarrhea, fatigue, cytopenias, hypertension, and nausea. Objective response rates were 22% (5 of 23) for DLBCL, 10% (2 of 21) for FL, 55% (6 of 11) for SLL/CLL, and 11% (1/9) for MCL. Median progression-free survival was 4.2 months. Disrupting BCR-induced signaling by inhibiting Syk represents a novel and active therapeutic approach for NHL and SLL/CLL. This trial was registered at www.clinicaltrials.gov as #NCT00446095.

Since the introduction of biologic therapies into the treatment paradigm of rheumatoid arthritis (RA), there has been hope that oral small molecule immune modulators would be developed that would have a risk : benefit profile at least similar to biologic therapies, be more convenient for the patient and, hopefully, be less expensive. This article reviews the progress made in the development of these compounds over the past year. Additional information has become available in the past year on five oral compounds including kinase inhibitors (tofacitinib, fostamatinib, VX-509), an S1P lyase inhibitor (LX 3305) and a chemokine receptor-1 antagonist (CCX354-C). Efficacy has been shown in phase III with tofacitinib and in phase II with fostamatinib and VX-509; safety was the primary endpoint of the trials of CCX354-C and LX3305. Regarding side effects, liver test elevation and neutropenia occurred with tofacitinib, VX-509 and fostamatinib; lipid elevation with tofacitinib and VX-509; creatinine elevation and anemia with tofacitinib, and hypertension and diarrhea with fostamatinib. Compounds that inhibit tyrosine kinase pathways involved in cellular signalling have been shown to be effective in the treatment of RA with a reasonable risk : benefit ratio. It is too early to tell about inhibitors of other pathways.

The pathogenesis of RA is a complex and ever-changing landscape but amid the chaos of the disease process we have found effective treatment regimes. However, our current therapeutics, although targeting various components of both the innate and adaptive immune response, do not result in disease remission. Protein kinase inhibitors are attractive targets due to their ability to influence downstream signalling and their oral bioavailability. Fostamatinib (R788) inhibits spleen tyrosine kinase (Syk) and has been in clinical trials involving both MTX inadequate responders (MTX-IRs) and biologic inadequate responders. Studies on the MTX-IR population revealed ACR20 responses of 67-72% at higher doses (150 mg bd and 100 mg bd), ACR50 responses of 43-57% and ACR70 responses of 28-40%. The trial in the biologic non-responder population showed no efficacy, however, post hoc analyses of the data suggested that a further trial in this population is warranted. The most common adverse events included gastrointestinal effects, hypertension, neutropenia and transaminitis. Many adverse effects were dose responsive and hypertension was amenable to treatment. Upper respiratory tract infections were more likely at higher doses, but no serious infections with tuberculosis, fungi or opportunistic infections were reported. The oral availability of these agents makes them attractive treatment options for our patients, although the literature from the oncology field suggests that patients will only choose the oral route if efficacy is equivalent. Long-term follow-up studies are ongoing and will be critical for rare side effects. The role of these agents in our current arsenal is unclear and economic analyses are awaited.

While target-based small-molecule discovery has taken centre-stage in the pharmaceutical industry, there are many cancer-promoting proteins not easily addressed with a traditional target-based screening approach. In order to address this problem, as well as to identify modulators of biological states in the absence of knowing the protein target of the state switch, alternative phenotypic screening approaches, such as gene expression-based and high-content imaging, have been developed. With this renewed interest in phenotypic screening, however, comes the challenge of identifying the binding protein target(s) of small-molecule hits. Emerging technologies have the potential to improve the process of target identification. In this review, we discuss the application of genomic (gene expression-based), genetic (short hairpin RNA and open reading frame screening), and proteomic approaches to protein target identification.

Spleen tyrosine kinase (Syk), a key mediator of immunoreceptor signaling in inflammatory cells, is essential for immune complex-mediated signal transduction initiated by activated receptors for immunoglobulin G. In collagen-induced arthritis, R788/R406, a novel and potent small molecule Syk inhibitor suppressed clinical arthritis, bone erosions, pannus formation, and synovitis. Serum anti-collagen type II antibody levels were unaltered, while the half-life of exogenous antibody was extended when co-administered with R406. Expression of the targeted kinase (Syk) in synovial tissue correlated with the joint level of inflammatory cell infiltrates and was virtually undetectable in treated rats. Syk inhibition suppressed synovial cytokines and cartilage oligomeric matrix protein (COMP) in serum, suggesting a sensitive and reliable biomarker for R406 activity. These results highlight the role of activating Fcgamma receptors in inflammatory synovitis and suggest that interruption of the signaling cascade with a novel Syk inhibitor may be a useful addition to immunosuppressive disease-modifying anti-rheumatic drugs currently used in the treatment of human autoimmune diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis.

Mantle cell lymphoma is a relatively rare B-cell lymphoma with a specific genetic lesion and a typical immunophenotypic profile. The median age is 65 years. There is no curative treatment, except allogeneic stem cell transplantation for a selected group of patients. For the majority of patients, especially the elderly, the aim of therapy should therefore be a long progression-free survival. Age and comorbidity may hamper the use of the most active treatment regimen, such as high dose cytarabine and autologous stem cell transplantation. Therefore, it is a challenge to select the most appropriate therapy for an elderly patient. Studies specifically designed for elderly patients are rare. A recently performed large randomized study for elderly patients, however, has shown that R-CHOP (rituximab with cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, vincristine, and prednisone) chemotherapy followed by maintenance rituximab can result in a long progression-free survival. For patients too frail for R-CHOP chemotherapy, a treatment should be offered that benefits the patient in reducing the symptoms of the disease without causing too many side effects. Progression or relapse will occur in all patients sooner or later. Second-line treatment should again be carefully selected. Several options are mentioned. New drugs are being developed, and new combinations are investigated. Further improvement in the outcome of patients with mantle cell lymphoma is expected. Participation in well-designed clinical trials, also by elderly patients, is important to find the real benefit that can be achieved, and to get information on the tolerability of these treatments in this age group.

Spleen tyrosine kinase (Syk) has been identified as an important modulator of immune signaling in B cells and cells bearing Fcgamma-activating receptors. R788, a prodrug of active metabolite R406, has been shown to be an inhibitor of Syk kinase, active in a variety of in vitro and in vivo models, suggesting potential activity in the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis (RA). We enrolled 189 patients with active RA despite methotrexate therapy in a 3-month, multicenter, ascending-dose, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial. The primary end point was the American College of Rheumatology 20% improvement criteria (ACR20) response rate at week 12. Twice-daily oral doses of 100 mg and 150 mg of R788 were significantly superior to placebo or twice-daily oral doses of 50 mg at week 12 (ACR20 achieved in 65% and 72% versus 38% and 32% of patients, respectively [P < 0.01]). ACR50 (achieved in 49% and 57% versus 19% and 17% of patients, respectively) and ACR70 (achieved in 33% and 40% versus 4% and 2% of patients, respectively) scores showed a similar pattern. Clinical effect was noted as early as 1 week after initiation of therapy. Reductions in serum interleukin-6 and matrix metalloproteinase 3 levels also occurred as early as week 1 in the groups receiving 100 mg and 150 mg R788. The major adverse effects were gastrointestinal side effects (predominantly diarrhea) and neutropenia (<1,500/mm3), both of which were dose related. These results indicate that an inhibitor of Syk kinase produces significant clinical benefits at 12 weeks in a population of patients with active RA receiving methotrexate therapy. Syk kinase may be an important new therapeutic target in RA and related autoimmune conditions.

Chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) is a malignancy of mature B cells that depend on host factors in the tissue microenvironment for survival and proliferation. In vitro, CLL cells rapidly undergo apoptosis unless microenvironmental factors are provided that support their survival. Signaling pathways activated in the microenvironment in vivo include the B-cell receptor (BCR) and NF-κB pathways. Thus, CLL is a disease "addicted to the host" and is dependent on pathways that promote normal B-cell development, expansion, and survival; this is particularly true in the case of the BCR signaling cascade. Small-molecule inhibitors of kinases that are essential for BCR signal transduction abrogate the stimulating effects of the microenvironment on CLL cells. The orally administered tyrosine kinase inhibitors fostamatinib and ibrutinib and the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase inhibitor GS-1101 have induced impressive responses in relapsed and refractory CLL patients, mostly with moderate side effects. Reductions in lymphadenopathy and splenomegaly are seen within weeks and are frequently accompanied by a transient rise in absolute lymphocyte count that is asymptomatic and probably the result of changes in CLL cell trafficking. This review discusses the biologic basis for kinase inhibitors as targeted therapy of CLL and summarizes the exciting early clinical experience with these agents.

The clearest evidence that B cells play an important role in human autoimmunity is that immunotherapies that deplete B cells are very effective treatments for many autoimmune diseases. All people, healthy or ill, have autoreactive B cells, but not at the same frequency. A number of genes influence the level of these autoreactive B cells and whether they are eliminated or not during development at a central checkpoint in the bone marrow (BM) or at a later checkpoint in peripheral lymphoid tissues. These genes include those encoding proteins that regulate signaling through the B-cell receptor complex such as Btk and PTPN22, proteins that regulate innate signaling via Toll-like receptors (TLRs) such as MyD88 and interleukin-1 receptor-associated kinase 4, as well as the gene encoding the activation-induced deaminase (AID) essential for B cells to undergo class switch recombination and somatic hypermutation. Recent studies have revealed that TLR signaling elements and AID function not only in peripheral B cells to help mediate effective antibody responses to foreign antigens, but also in the BM to help remove autoreactive B-lineage cells at a very early point in B-cell development. Newly arising B cells that leave the BM and enter the blood and splenic red pulp can express both AID and TLR signaling elements like TLR7, and thus are fully equipped to respond rapidly to antigens (including autoantigens), to isotype class switch, and to undergo somatic hypermutation. These red pulp B cells may thus be an important source of autoantibody-producing cells arising particularly in extrafollicular sites, and indeed may be as significant a source of autoantibody-producing cells as B cells arising from germinal centers.

After two decades of research and development activity focussed on orally active kinase inhibitors, the first such drug (the JAK inhibitor Xeljanz, tofacitinib) was approved by the FDA in November 2012 for the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis (RA). There is an intense activity in many companies both on expanding the utility of JAK inhibitors in other auto-immune indications and in discovering inhibitors of the JAK family with different and more selective profiles. Progress is also being made with orally active Syk inhibitors. One such inhibitor (fostamatinib) is currently in large-scale phase 3 trials, and there are others in clinical development. The last two to three years have been transformative for kinase inhibitors in auto-immune diseases, as several inhibitors have finally progressed beyond phase 2 trials after so many failures on other targets. Thus, there are new treatment options for RA patients beyond existing oral DMARDs and parenteral biologics.

Normal B lymphocytes receive signals from B-cell antigen receptor (BCR) that are triggered by binding of the BCR to an external antigen. Tonic signaling through the BCR provides growth and signals to chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) cells, and plays an important role in the pathogenesis and progression of the disease. Antigen engagement of BCR is followed by intracellular recruitment and activation of BCR-associated kinases including spleen tyrosine kinase (Syk), Bruton's tyrosine kinase (Btk) and phosphatidylinositol 3-kinases (PI3K). Inhibition of signaling pathways downstream of the BCR induces disruption of chemokine-mediated CLL cell migration and cell killing. BCR signal transduction inhibitors represent a promising new strategy for targeted CLL treatment. A number of therapeutic agents have recently been developed with significant activity in CLL. The compounds that are currently investigated in patients with CLL include ibrutinib -inhibitor of Btk, fostamatinib-inhibitor of Syk and idelalisib (GS-1101) -a specific isoform of the PI3K (PI3K) inhibitor. The clinical activity of ibrutinib, GS-1101 and fostamatinib in patients with CLL is associated with marked lymphocytosis due to release of tumor cells from the lymph nodes into the peripheral blood. Further studies are ongoing with single agents and their combinations with other targeted and conventional therapies. This article will review the preclinical rationale of BCR signaling inhibitors in the treatment of CLL, and the clinical evidence supporting the use of these agents in CLL patients.

The spleen tyrosine kinase (Syk) inhibitor R406 is orally administered as the prodrug R788. Following administration of R788 (12.5 mg kg(-1), 20 microCi kg(-1 14)C-R788) to intact and bile duct-cannulated cynomolgus monkeys, drug-related radioactivity was rapidly observed in plasma. No R788 was observed in plasma, while R406 was the major radioactive peak observed at all time points. Only low levels of metabolites were observed in plasma. The half-life for plasma radioactivity was 2.0-2.8 h. The majority (68.9%) of drug-related radioactivity was eliminated into bile. No intact R406 was observed in excreta. Biliary and urinary metabolites consisted of glucuronide and sulfate conjugates of the para-O-demethylated metabolite of R406 (R529), and a direct N-glucuronide of R406. The major metabolite in faeces from intact and bile duct-cannulated monkeys was a unique 3,5-benzene diol metabolite of R406. This metabolite was formed following the sequential O-demethylation and para-dehydroxylation of R529 by anaerobic gut bacteria.

Multiple advances have been made in our understanding of pathobiology of chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL). These developments in the laboratory include new prognostic markers, risk stratification of the disease and newer therapeutic agents in CLL. These advances in CLL have come a long way in the past three decades since the development of Rai and Binet clinical staging systems. Important strides in the pathobiology, from defining mutational status of IGHV, to B-cell receptor (BCR) signaling pathways and CLL microenvironment have made a major difference in our understanding of this disease. Mutational status of immunoglobulin heavy chain genes (IGHV), CD38 and Zap-70, chromosomal aberrations and newer mutations, are the most clinically relevant prognostic markers. Chemoimmunotherapy (CIT) has become the treatment of choice for young and fit CLL patients. Various inhibitors of BCR signaling pathways and immunomodulatory drugs have shown efficacy in clinical trials. The most recent advance is the use of chimeric antigen receptor therapy (CAR) based on autologous T-lymphocytes. Nevertheless, CLL remains an incurable disease today. Coordinated developments between laboratory and clinic will hopefully translate into a cure for CLL. This short review focuses on advances in prognostication and therapy in CLL.

Despite tremendous advances in the therapy of rheumatoid arthritis (RA), there remains interest in oral agents that may offer benefits that are similar to, or better than, those of biologic therapies. In their paper, Chang and colleagues demonstrate the effectiveness of a Bruton tyrosine kinase (Btk) inhibitor in two models of RA. Btk inhibition impacts several pathways affecting both B-cell and macrophage activation, making it a promising target in RA. However, other kinase inhibitors have failed to transition from animal models to human therapy, so it remains to be seen whether a Btk inhibitor will have a role in the RA treatment armamentarium.

Antibody-mediated glomerulonephritis, including that resulting from immune complexes, is an important cause of renal failure and is in need of more specific and effective treatment. Binding of antibody or immune complexes to Fc receptors activates intracellular signal transduction pathways, including spleen tyrosine kinase (Syk), leading to the production of inflammatory cytokines. We examined the effect of R788 (fostamatinib disodium), an oral prodrug of the selective Syk inhibitor R406, in nephrotoxic nephritis in Wistar-Kyoto rats. Treatment with R788 reduced proteinuria, tissue injury, glomerular macrophage and CD8+ cell numbers, and renal monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 (MCP-1) and IL-1beta, even when we started treatment after the onset of glomerulonephritis. When we administered R788 from days 4 to 10, glomerular crescents reduced by 100% (P < 0.01) compared with the vehicle group. When we administered R788 treatment from days 7 to 14, established glomerular crescents reversed (reduced by 21%, P < 0.001), and renal function was better than the vehicle group (P < 0.001). In vitro, R406 downregulated MCP-1 production from mesangial cells and macrophages stimulated with aggregated IgG. These results suggest that Syk is an important therapeutic target for the treatment of glomerulonephritis.

Cell signaling initiated by the B cell receptor is critical to normal development of B lymphocytes, most notably at the transitional B cell stage. Inhibition of this signaling pathway with the syk inhibitor, fostamatinib, has produced significant efficacy in lymphoid malignancies and autoimmune conditions. Here, we demonstrate that short-term use of fostamatinib impairs B lymphocyte development at the transitional stage without affecting mature B cell populations. Additionally, IL-10 producing B cells remained relatively constant throughout the treatment period. These findings provide insight into the mechanism of action of B cell receptor inhibition in autoimmune disease. As the development of agents targeting B cell receptor signaling proceeds, monitoring for long-term consequences as well as functional evaluation of B cell subsets may further improve our understanding of this rapidly growing class of novel agents.

Protein kinases (PKs) and lipid kinases (LKs) are good choices for targets of signal transduction therapy as these enzymes are involved in signaling pathways, and are often related to the pathogenesis of lymphoid malignancies. The attractiveness of PKs and LKs as drug able targets is enhanced by the fact that they are enzymes whose biological activity can be turned off by drugs that block their catalytic site. In the last few years small molecular kinase inhibitors (KIs) have been synthesized and become available for preclinical studies and clinical trials. The first KI, introduced into clinical practice in 1998, was imatinib mesylate, which became the first choice drug in chronic myeloid leukemia. More recently, several KIs have been developed to target the proximal B-cell receptor (BCR) signaling pathway including spleen tyrosine kinase inhibitor (Fostamatinib) and Bruton's tyrosine kinase inhibitors (Ibrutinib, AVL-263). These agents are currently evaluated in early clinical trials in chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) and other diseases. Cyclin-dependent kinase (Cdk) inhibitors, flavopiridol (alvocidib), BMS-387032 (SNS-032), sunitinib and sorafenib are currently under evaluation in clinical trials for relapsed/refractory CLL. Multi-tyrosine kinase inhibitors including vandetanib (ZD6474) bosutinib (SKI-606), TKI258 (CHIR-258), pazopanib (GW786034) and axitinib (AG013736) have been also developed for the treatment of lymphoid malignancies. Phosphatidylinositol 3-kinases (PI3K ) are a family of lipid kinases that mediate signals from cell surface receptors. CAL-101 (GS-1101) is an oral PI3Kδ-specific inhibitor which has shown preclinical and clinical activity against CLL. This article summarizes recent achievements in the mechanism of action, pharmacological properties and clinical activity and toxicity of PK and LK inhibitors in CLL.

Spleen tyrosine kinase (Syk) is a cytoplasmic tyrosine kinase involved in signalling in many of the cells that drive immune inflammation. The development of small molecules that inhibit Syk kinase may change the way we treat disorders such as rheumatoid arthritis (RA), as well as a range of other inflammatory diseases. Fostamatinib (R-788) is an orally bioavailable small molecule. It is the prodrug of R406, which is a potent Syk inhibitor. Fostamatinib was developed because it has more favourable physiochemical properties. It is rapidly converted to R406 by intestinal enterocytes. It has been evaluated in experimental models of RA, such as collagen-induced arthritis. In these models, fostamatinib suppressed clinical arthritis, bone erosions, pannus formation and synovitis. A phase II programme with fostamatinib has largely been completed. Three key trials have been published, lasting 12-26 weeks and each enrolling 189-457 patients (875 in total). All these trials involved placebo therapy and patients continued to receive methotrexate in addition to active treatment with fostamatinib. The first dose-ranging trial evaluated three treatment doses in RA patients who had not fully responded to methotrexate therapy. The second trial compared two treatment doses in patients who had not responded to methotrexate therapy. The third trial compared a single treatment dose with placebo in patients who had not responded to biological therapy. The primary outcome measure was the number of patients achieving American College of Rheumatology (ACR) 20% (ACR20) responses. Placebo ACR20 response rates in all three trials were similar (35-38%). All three trials involved one treatment arm receiving fostamatinib 100 mg twice daily; ACR20 responses with this active treatment ranged from 38% to 67%. A meta-analysis of ACR responses in these trials, using responses to the highest dose in each trial for comparisons with placebo therapy in a random effects model, showed a borderline benefit with ACR20 responses. There were more significant differences with ACR50 and ACR70 responses. The reason that this meta-analysis was not more strongly positive is that the third trial, which evaluated patients who had failed to respond to biological treatments, gave negative results. Individual ACR response components, such as changes in swollen joint counts, showed significant differences in the first two trials, but there were no definite treatment benefits in the third trial. Overall, the differences were significant in a meta-analysis of all three trials. The most important adverse reactions were diarrhoea, neutropenia and raised ALT levels, which all showed significant excesses with active treatment compared with placebo. Too few patients have been studied for a definitive safety profile to be known. Overall, the results of the phase II trials were sufficiently encouraging for a phase III programme to be initiated. It will be some years before their definitive results are available.

Urogenital abnormalities are among the most common of all human birth defects. In developmental toxicity studies with the Syk kinase inhibitor R788, a spectrum of findings, including renal agenesis, were observed. R788 has also been found to inhibit the receptor tyrosine kinase Ret. Ret kinase is known to be an essential component in the signaling pathway required for renal organogenesis and ureteric duct formation. Previously known is that mutant mice without the c-ret gene, develop urogenital malformations including renal agenesis. In GLP developmental toxicity studies, gravid rabbits were treated orally with R788 at doses of 0, 10, 22, and 50 mg/kg/day (gestation days 7-19) and gravid rats received 0, 5, 12.5, and 25 mg/kg/day (gestation days 6-17) by the same route. The activity of R406 against Ret kinase was assessed in biochemical and cell-based assays. A dose-dependent increase in malformations, including renal and ureteric agenesis and a specific major vessel anomaly, retroesophageal right subclavian artery, was observed in both the rat and rabbit. R788 proved to be a potent inhibitor of Ret kinase. R788 promoted a spectrum of developmental toxicity, including renal and ureteric agenesis and a specific major vessel abnormality, retroesophageal right subclavian artery, in two different species. These effects are likely the result of inhibition of Ret kinase given its importance in the normal ontogeny of the urogenital and cardiovascular systems across species.

CLL cell trafficking between blood and tissue compartments is an integral part of the disease process. Idelalisib, a phosphoinositide 3-kinase delta (PI3Kδ) inhibitor causes rapid lymph node shrinkage, along with an increase in lymphocytosis, prior to inducing objective responses in CLL patients. This characteristic activity presumably is due to CLL cell redistribution from tissues into the blood, but the underlying mechanisms are not fully understood. We therefore analyzed idelalisib effects on CLL cell adhesion to endothelial and bone marrow stromal cells (EC, BMSC). We found that idelalisib inhibited CLL cell adhesion to EC and BMSC under static and shear flow conditions. TNFα-induced VCAM-1 (CD106) expression in supporting layers increased CLL cell adhesion and accentuated the inhibitory effect of idelalisib. Co-culture with EC and BMSC also protected CLL from undergoing apoptosis, and this EC- and BMSC-mediated protection was antagonized by idelalisib. Furthermore, we demonstrate that CLL cell adhesion to EC and VLA-4 (CD49d) resulted in the phosphorylation of Akt, which was sensitive to inhibition by idelalisib. These findings demonstrate that idelalisib interferes with integrin-mediated CLL cell adhesion to EC and BMSC, providing a novel mechanism to explain idelalisib-induced redistribution of CLL cells from tissues into the blood.

Chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) is a heterogeneous disease with a variable course, and remains an incurable disease. Frequent relapses and eventual resistance to fludarabine characterize symptomatic CLL and portends a dismal prognosis for patients. Growing evidence has shown that signaling pathways such as the B cell receptor and NFkB are implicated in the survival and proliferation of the CLL cells which are ultimately associated with persistence of the disease. The Bruton's tyrosine kinase pathway regulates downstream activation of the B cell receptor and has emerged as an attractive target. Ibrutinib inhibits the Bruton's tyrosine kinase pathway, and consequently induces apoptosis of B cells. Phase I and II studies have shown impressive response rates with an excellent safety profile in patients with refractory/relapsed CLL and elderly treatment-naïve CLL patients. This paper reviews the preclinical and clinical data for ibrutinib when used in the treatment of CLL. Recent studies showing the benefit of combination therapy using ibrutinib, monoclonal antibodies, and chemoimmunotherapy are also discussed.

Spleen tyrosine kinase (SYK) is the best known for its involvement in immune receptor signalling, mediated by binding of SYK tandem Src-homology 2 domains to tandem phosphotyrosine in immunoreceptor tyrosine-based activation motifs (ITAMs). ITAM adaptors or ITAM-containing receptor tails mediate signalling from B- and T-cell receptors, Fc receptors and many C-type lectins, including dectin-1. Recent data point to constitutive binding of SYK to the cytoplasmic domain of toll-like receptor-4 (TLR4). This SYK-TLR4 binding increases upon TLR4 dimerization and phosphorylation, and SYK plays a prominent role in TLR4 signalling in response to LPS in neutrophils and monocytes. SYK also plays an important role in TLR4-mediated macrophage responses to minimally oxidized low-density lipoprotein (mmLDL), which is a form of oxidized LDL relevant to development of human atherosclerosis. Interestingly, mmLDL-induced effects in macrophages, which occur via TLR4, are predominantly MyD88 independent. This unmasks the role of the SYK branch of TLR4 signalling, which mediates modest cytokine release via activation of AP-1 transcription and robust reactive oxygen species generation and cytoskeletal rearrangements. The latter results in extensive membrane ruffling and macropinocytosis, leading to lipoprotein uptake and foam cell formation, a hallmark of atherosclerotic lesions. Because inhibitors of SYK activity, such as fostamatinib, are in advanced clinical trials for rheumatoid arthritis and other autoimmune diseases, understanding the role of SYK in signalling via TLR4 is of immediate importance. This signalling pathway seems to be particularly important in TLR4 activation by host-derived, damage-associated molecular pattern ligands, such as mmLDL, relevant to development of atherosclerosis and other chronic inflammatory diseases.

In patients with active rheumatoid arthritis despite therapy with DMARDS, treatment with a spleen tyrosine kinase inhibitor has achieved similar response rates to those achieved in clinical trials of other drugs, including biologic agents.

Fostamatinib (R788) is an orally dosed prodrug designed to deliver the active metabolite R940406 (R406), a spleen tyrosine kinase (SYK) inhibitor, for the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis. The objectives were to evaluate the human pharmacokinetic properties of fostamatinib and R406. Three clinical studies were conducted in healthy subjects: (A) A single ascending dose study for R406 with doses ranging from 80-600 mg, (B) a single- and multiple-dose study of fostamatinib in aqueous suspension, with single doses ranging from 80-400 mg and multiple doses at 160 mg twice daily and (C) a study comparing suspension and tablet of fostamatinib, with the latter tested in both fed and fasted states. These studies demonstrated that when administered as a solution, R406 was rapidly absorbed. Increases in exposure were observed with doses up to 400 mg. A terminal half-life of 12-21 h was observed. Similar R406 exposure could be achieved with fostamatinib suspension and steady-state was achieved after 3-4 days following twice daily administration. Fostamatinib tablet and suspension exhibited similar R406 exposure. Upon co-administration with food, a delay in peak time and lower peak concentrations of R406 were observed but at the same time the overall exposure did not change. Fostamatinib demonstrates rapid and extensive conversion to R406, an inhibitor of SYK. Solid dosage forms of fostamatinib overcome the challenge of low aqueous solubility of R406. The PK profile of R406 could potentially allow once daily or twice daily oral administration of fostamatinib.

Posttransplant lymphoproliferative disorder (PTLD)-associated Epstein-Barr virus (EBV)+ B cell lymphomas are serious complications of solid organ and bone marrow transplantation. The EBV protein LMP2a, a B cell receptor (BCR) mimic, provides survival signals to virally infected cells through Syk tyrosine kinase. Therefore, we explored whether Syk inhibition is a viable therapeutic strategy for EBV-associated PTLD. We have shown that R406, the active metabolite of the Syk inhibitor fostamatinib, induces apoptosis and cell cycle arrest while decreasing downstream phosphatidylinositol-3'-kinase (PI3K)/Akt signaling in EBV+ B cell lymphoma PTLD lines in vitro. However, Syk inhibition did not inhibit or delay the in vivo growth of solid tumors established from EBV-infected B cell lines. Instead, we observed tumor growth in adjacent inguinal lymph nodes exclusively in fostamatinib-treated animals. In contrast, direct inhibition of PI3K/Akt significantly reduced tumor burden in a xenogeneic mouse model of PTLD without evidence of tumor growth in adjacent inguinal lymph nodes. Taken together, our data indicate that Syk activates PI3K/Akt signaling which is required for survival of EBV+ B cell lymphomas. PI3K/Akt signaling may be a promising therapeutic target for PTLD, and other EBV-associated malignancies.

Chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) is a disease of malignant CD5+ B lymphocytes that are characterized by frequent expression of autoreactive B-cell receptors (BCRs) and marked dependence on microenvironmental signals for proliferation and survival. Among the latter, signals propagated through the BCR are believed to play a key role in leukemia initiation, maintenance and evolution. Drugs that can disrupt these signals have recently emerged as potential therapeutic agents in CLL and several of them are currently being evaluated in clinical trials. Particularly promising clinical responses have been obtained with inhibitors of the kinases SYK, BTK, and PI3Kδ, which function by blocking BCR signal transduction. In addition, recent studies focusing on the phosphatase PTPN22, which is involved in the pathogenesis of multiple autoimmune diseases and is markedly overexpressed in CLL cells, suggest that it may be possible in the future to develop strategies that will selectively reprogram BCR survival signals into signals that induce leukemic cell death. This review focuses on the biological basis behind these strategies and highlights some of the most promising BCR-targeting agents in ongoing preclinical and clinical studies.

Conventional immunosuppressive therapies have radically transformed patient survival in systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), but their use is associated with considerable toxicity and a substantial proportion of patients remain refractory to treatment. A more comprehensive understanding of the complexity of SLE immunopathogenesis has evolved over the past decade and has led to the testing of several biologic agents in clinical trials. There is a clear need for new therapeutic agents that overcome these issues, and biologic agents offer exciting prospects as future SLE therapies.An array of promising new therapies are currently emerging or are under development including B-cell depletion therapies, agents targeting B-cell survival factors, blockade of T-cell co-stimulation and anti-cytokine therapies, such as monoclonal antibodies against interleukin-6 and interferon-α.

In the last few years, several tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) have been synthesized and become available for preclinical studies and clinical trials. This article summarizes recent achievements in the mechanism of action, pharmacological properties, and clinical activity and toxicity, as well as the emerging role of TKIs in lymphoid malignancies, allergic diseases, and autoimmune disorders. A literature review was conducted of the MEDLINE database PubMed for articles in English. Publications from 2000 through January 2012 were scrutinized. The search terms used were Bruton's tyrosine kinase (Btk) inhibitors, PCI-32765, GDC-0834, LFM-A13, AVL-101, AVL-292, spleen tyrosine kinase (Syk) inhibitors, R343, R406, R112, R788, fostamatinib, BAY-61-3606, C-61, piceatannol, Lyn, imatinib, nilotinib, bafetinib, dasatinib, GDC-0834, PP2, SU6656 in conjunction with lymphoid malignancy, NHL, CLL, autoimmune disease, allergic disease, asthma, and rheumatoid arthritis. Conference proceedings from the previous 5 years of the American Society of Hematology, European Hematology Association, American Society of Clinical Oncology, and ACR/ARHP Annual Scientific Meetings were searched manually. Additional relevant publications were obtained by reviewing the references from the chosen articles. The use of TKIs, especially inhibitors of Btk, Syk, and Lyn, is a promising new strategy for targeted treatment of B-cell lymphoid malignancies, autoimmune disorders and allergic diseases. However, definitive data from ongoing and future clinical trials will aid in better defining the status of TKIs in the treatment of these disorders.

Genetic factors play an important role in determining the risk of multiple sclerosis (MS). The strongest genetic association in MS is located within the major histocompatibility complex class II region (MHC), but more than 50 MS loci of modest effect located outside the MHC have now been identified. However, the relative candidate genes that underlie these associations and their functions are largely unknown. We conducted a protein-protein interaction (PPI) analysis of gene products coded in loci recently reported to be MS associated at the genome-wide significance level and in loci suggestive of MS association. Our aim was to identify which suggestive regions are more likely to be truly associated, which genes are mostly implicated in the PPI network and their expression profile. From three recent independent association studies, SNPs were considered and divided into significant and suggestive depending on the strength of the statistical association. Using the Disease Association Protein-Protein Link Evaluator tool we found that direct interactions among genetic products were significantly higher than expected by chance when considering both significant regions alone (p<0.0002) and significant plus suggestive (p<0.007). The number of genes involved in the network was 43. Of these, 23 were located within suggestive regions and many of them directly interacted with proteins coded within significant regions. These included genes such as SYK, IL-6, CSF2RB, FCLR3, EIF4EBP2 and CHST12. Using the gene portal BioGPS, we tested the expression of these genes in 24 different tissues and found the highest values among immune-related cells as compared to non-immune tissues (p<0.001). A gene ontology analysis confirmed the immune-related functions of these genes. In conclusion, loci currently suggestive of MS association interact with and have similar expression profiles and function as those significantly associated, highlighting the fact that more common variants remain to be found to be associated to MS.

The initial response of lymphoid malignancies to glucocorticoids (GCs) is a critical parameter predicting successful treatment. Although being known as a strong inducer of apoptosis in lymphoid cells for almost a century, the signaling pathways regulating the susceptibility of the cells to GCs are only partly revealed. There is still a need to develop clinical tests that can predict the outcome of GC therapy. In this paper, I discuss important parameters modulating the pro-apoptotic effects of GCs, with a specific emphasis on the microRNA world comprised of small players with big impacts. The journey through the multifaceted complexity of GC-induced apoptosis brings forth explanations for the differential treatment response and raises potential strategies for overcoming drug resistance.

Chemokines and their ligands play a critical role in enabling chronic lymphocytic leukaemia (CLL) cells access to protective microenvironmental niches within tissues, ultimately resulting in chemoresistance and relapse: disruption of these signaling pathways has become a novel therapeutic approach in CLL. The tyrosine kinase inhibitor dasatinib inhibits migration of several cell lines from solid-organ tumours, but effects on CLL cells have not been reported. We studied the effect of clinically achievable concentrations of dasatinib on signaling induced by the chemokine CXCL12 through its' receptor CXCR4, which is highly expressed on CLL cells. Dasatinib pre-treatment inhibited Akt and ERK phosphorylation in CLL cells upon stimulation with CXCL12. Dasatinib also significantly diminished the rapid increase in actin polymerisation observed in CLL cells following CXCL12 stimulation. Moreover, the drug significantly inhibited chemotaxis in a transwell assay, and reduced the percentage of cells able to migrate beneath a CXCL12-expressing murine stromal cell line. Dasatinib also abrogated the anti-apoptotic effect of prolonged CXCL12 stimulation on cultured CLL cells. These data suggest that dasatinib, akin to other small molecule kinase inhibitors targeting the B-cell receptor signaling pathway, may redistribute CLL cells from protective tissue niches to the peripheral blood, and support the investigation of dasatinib in combination strategies.
