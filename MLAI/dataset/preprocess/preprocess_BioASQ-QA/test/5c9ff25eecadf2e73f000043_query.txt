Where, in the body, would the Cobb-Stainsby excision arthroplasty be performed?

[PMID: 29413774]
Dislocated metatarsophalangeal joints from clawed or hammer toes can be a disabling consequence of several conditions. The Cobb-Stainsby forefoot arthroplasty combines partial phalangectomy (Stainsby) with extensor tendon transfer to the metatarsal head (Cobb). We present a retrospective, three surgeon case series of 215 toes in 126 patients. Early results and complications were gathered from the medical charts of 126 patients who met the inclusion criteria. Seventy-five patients were contactable by phone with a follow up range of 12-82 months (median follow up 45 months). Primary outcome measures were improvement of pain and function, reduction in plantar callosities and cosmetic improvement of the deformity. Pre-operatively all patients presented with pain and shoe wear problems. Post-operatively seventy-two patients (96%) were satisfied, 72 (96%) reported pain relief, 55 (73%) were happy with toe control, 61 (81%) were pleased with cosmesis and 56 (75%) reported unlimited daily activities. Superficial wound infections were observed in 13 of the 126 patients (10%) and two in 75 patients (2%) developed recurrent clawing. Our case series demonstrates improved outcomes over alternatives such as the Weil's osteotomy.
