Mesenchymal stem cells are fundamental for bone formation and repair since they respond to microenvironmental stimuli by undergoing osteogenic differentiation. We show that the kinase and cation channel TRPM7 and the magnesium transporter MagT1 have a role in harmonizing the osteogenic differentiation of human mesenchymal stem cells. TRPM7 and MagT1 are upregulated in osteogenic differentiation and silencing either one accelerates osteogenic differentiation, partly through the activation of autophagy. Intriguingly, similar results were obtained when the cells were cultured under magnesium deficient conditions. These results underpin the contribution of magnesium, TRPM7 and MagT1 to autophagy and osteoblastogenesis.

Cation homeostasis, in relation to various immune-suppressive diseases, is a novel field of investigation. Recently, patients with a loss-of-function mutation in magnesium transporter 1 (MAGT1) were reported to present a dysregulated Mg<sup>2+</sup> homeostasis in T lymphocytes. Using <i>Magt1</i>-knockout mice (<i>Magt1<sup>-/y</sup></i> ), we show that Mg<sup>2+</sup> homeostasis was impaired in <i>Magt1<sup>-/y</sup></i> B cells and Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx was increased after BCR stimulation, whereas T and NK cell function was unaffected. Consequently, mutant B cells displayed an increased phosphorylation of BCR-related proteins differentially affecting protein kinase C activation. These in vitro findings translated into increased frequencies of CD19<sup>+</sup> B cells and marginal zone B cells and decreased frequencies of plasma cells among CD45<sup>+</sup> splenocytes in vivo. Altogether, our study demonstrates for the first time, to our knowledge, that abolished MAGT1 function causes imbalanced cation homeostasis and developmental responses in B cells. Therefore, this study might contribute to a further understanding of B cell-related pathologies.

The magnesium transporter 1 (MAGT1) is a critical regulator of basal intracellular free magnesium ([Mg<sup>2+</sup>]i) levels. It has been shown that MAGT1 was involved in the disorder in Mg<sup>2+</sup> homeostasis after Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) infection. Here, we identified the effects of MAGT1-mediated disturbance of Mg<sup>2+</sup> homeostasis on chronic hepatitis B virus (HBV)-infected natural killer (NK) and CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells. The expression of MAGT1 was gradually decreased with the increase of infected time in CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells, but not with that in NK cells, of the patients. Decreased level of intracellular free Mg<sup>2+</sup> ([Mg<sup>2+</sup>]i) leads to defective expression of programmed cell death 1 (PD-1) and the NK activating receptor (NKG2D) in NK and CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells. Our data illustrate that [Mg<sup>2+</sup>]i plays a key role in control of HBV infection.
