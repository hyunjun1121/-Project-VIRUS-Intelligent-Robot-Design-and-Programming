Selexipag is used for which disease?

[PMID: 24392948]
Selexipag is a first-in-class orally available selective non-prostanoid IP receptor agonist. This review was based on a PubMed search and focuses on the potential role of selexipag in the treatment of pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH). Selexipag is rapidly hydrolyzed to an active metabolite, ACT-333679. Both selexipag and its metabolite are highly selective for the IP receptor compared with other prostanoid receptors. This selectivity for the IP receptor offers the potential for improved tolerability with selexipag, as side effects (e.g., nausea and vomiting) that might result from activation of the other prostanoid receptors may be minimized. In addition, the selexipag metabolite has a half-life of 7.9 h, thus permitting oral dosing twice daily. Selexipag showed effects on pharmacodynamic end points obtained with right heart catheterization in a Phase II trial in patients with PAH, and is being evaluated in the ongoing Phase III trial (GRIPHON trial, Clinicaltrials.gov NCT01106014). The signal of a beneficial effect of selexipag on disease progression may become more robust for long term under prolonged exposure. Pending the GRIPHON trial results, selexipag could provide a convenient first-line prostacyclin treatment option for patients with PAH.

In this phase 2 proof-of-concept study we examined the safety and efficacy of selexipag, an orally available, selective prostacyclin receptor (IP receptor) agonist, as a treatment for pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH). 43 adult patients with symptomatic PAH (receiving stable endothelin receptor antagonist and/or a phosphodiesterase type-5 inhibitor therapy) were randomised three to one to receive either selexipag or placebo. Dosage was up-titrated in 200-μg increments from 200 μg twice daily on day 1 to the maximum tolerated dose by day 35 (maximum allowed dose of 800 μg twice daily). Change in pulmonary vascular resistance at week 17 expressed as a percentage of the baseline value was the primary efficacy end-point, and was analysed in the per protocol set first and then in the all-treated set to assess robustness of results. A statistically significant 30.3% reduction in geometric mean pulmonary vascular resistance was observed after 17 weeks' treatment with selexipag compared with placebo (95% confidence limits -44.7- -12.2; p=0.0045, Wilcoxon rank sum test). This was supported by a similar result from the all-treated set. Selexipag was well tolerated with a safety profile in line with the expected pharmacological effect. Our results encourage the further investigation of selexipag for the treatment of PAH.

Selexipag is a novel, oral, selective prostacyclin (PGI2) receptor agonist in clinical development for the treatment of pulmonary arterial hypertension. Film-coated tablets with strength between 200 and 1,600 μg were used. Bioequivalence between 8 x 200 μg and a new 1,600 μg tablet was evaluated at steady state in healthy male subjects. This was an open-label, 2-treatment, 2-period, crossover, up-titration, phase 1 study. The treatments were selexipag at 1,600 μg b.i.d. for 4.5 days either as 8 x 200 μg tablets (reference: A) or 1 x 1,600 μg tablet (test: B), both preceded by an up-titration phase starting from 400 μg b.i.d. doses, in 200-μg steps every 4th day. Subjects were randomized 1 : 1 to the A-B or B-A sequence. The pharmacokinetics and tolerability of selexipag and its active metabolite, ACT-333679, were investigated. 80 subjects were enrolled in the study: 65 subjects completed the study according to protocol, and 15 subjects withdrew from the study. The most frequent adverse events (AEs) were headache (86%), myalgia (73%), and jaw pain (73%). There was no difference in nature and overall frequency of AEs between the two treatments. Steady state was attained within 3 days of the selexipag 1,600 Î¼g b.i.d. The 90% confidence intervals (CIs) of the geometric mean ratio (B/A) at steady state for AUCÏ and Cmax,ss were within (0.80, 1.25) bioequivalence interval: (0.92, 1.06) and (0.95, 1.14), respectively, for selexipag and (0.95, 1.06) and (0.94, 1.07), respectively, for the active metabolite, ACT-333679. Bioequivalence was demonstrated between 8 x 200 μg and 1 x 1,600 μg selexipag at steady state.

{4-[(5,6-Diphenylpyrazin-2-yl)(isopropyl)amino]butoxy}acetic acid (ACT-333679) is the main metabolite of the selective prostacyclin (PGI(2)) receptor (IP receptor) agonist selexipag. The goal of this study was to determine the influence of IP receptor selectivity on the vasorelaxant efficacy of ACT-333679 and the PGI(2) analog treprostinil in pulmonary artery under conditions associated with pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH). Selexipag and ACT-333679 evoked full relaxation of pulmonary artery from control and monocrotaline (MCT)-PAH rats, and ACT-333679 relaxed normal pulmonary artery contracted with either endothelin-1 (ET-1) or phenylephrine. In contrast, treprostinil evoked weaker relaxation than ACT-333679 of control pulmonary artery and failed to induce relaxation of pulmonary artery from MCT-PAH rats. Treprostinil did not evoke relaxation of normal pulmonary artery contracted with either ET-1 or phenylephrine. Expression of prostaglandin E(3) (EP(3)) receptor mRNA was increased in pulmonary artery from MCT-PAH rats. In contraction experiments, the selective EP(3) receptor agonist sulprostone evoked significantly greater contraction of pulmonary artery from MCT-PAH rats compared with control rats. The presence of a threshold concentration of ET-1 significantly augmented the contractile response to sulprostone in normal pulmonary artery. ACT-333679 did not evoke direct contraction of rat pulmonary artery, whereas treprostinil evoked concentration-dependent contraction that was inhibited by the EP(3) receptor antagonist (2E)-3-(3',4'-dichlorobiphenyl-2-yl)-N-(2-thienylsulfonyl)acrylamide. Antagonism of EP(3) receptors also revealed a relaxant response to treprostinil in normal pulmonary artery contracted with ET-1. These data demonstrate that the relaxant efficacy of the selective IP receptor agonist selexipag and its metabolite ACT-333679 is not modified under conditions associated with PAH, whereas relaxation to treprostinil may be limited in the presence of mediators of disease.

The objective of this study was to assess the safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics, and pharmacodynamics of selexipag, an orally available selective prostacyclin receptor agonist, in development for pulmonary arterial hypertension in healthy subjects. This was a double-blind, placebo-controlled, randomised, multiple-ascending-dose, up-titration study. Male subjects received increasing oral doses of selexipag (400-1,800 µg; n = 12) or placebo (n = 4) twice daily for 3 days each, using incremental steps of 200 µg between each dose level. Standard safety and tolerability data were collected. Blood samples were taken to assess the pharmacokinetics of selexipag and its active metabolite ACT-333679 and possible effects on platelet aggregation. Dose levels of selexipag up to 1,600 μg were well tolerated and this dose was identified as the maximum tolerated dose. Plasma exposure to ACT-333679 was approximately 4 times higher than that to selexipag. Steady-state conditions for both compounds were reached on day 3 of each dose level, and no accumulation of selexipag or ACT-333679 was observed. Based on the area under the curve and the maximum plasma concentration, the pharmacokinetics of selexipag and ACT-333679 were dose proportional. At the highest dose level, the geometric mean terminal half-life of selexipag and ACT-333679 was 1.4 and 8.7 h, respectively. The observed effects on platelet aggregation were variable without obvious drug- or dose-dependent pattern. Oral administration of increasing doses of selexipag was well tolerated. The present results support the conduct of future clinical trials.
