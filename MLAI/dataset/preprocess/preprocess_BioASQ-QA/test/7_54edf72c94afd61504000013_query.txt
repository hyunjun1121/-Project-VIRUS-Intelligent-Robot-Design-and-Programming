What is the presumed key event in Fanconi anemia pathogenesis?

[PMID: 22675617]
Fanconi Anemia (FA) is a genetic disorder characterized by the inability of patient cells to repair DNA damage caused by interstrand crosslinking agents. There are currently 14 verified FA genes, where mutation of any single gene prevents repair of DNA interstrand crosslinks (ICLs). The accumulation of ICL damage results in genome instability and patients having a high predisposition to cancers. The key event of the FA pathway is dependent on an eight-protein core complex (CC), required for the monoubiquitination of each member of the FANCD2-FANCI complex. Interestingly, the majority of patient mutations reside in the CC. The molecular mechanisms underlying the requirement for such a large complex to carry out a monoubiquitination event remain a mystery. This paper documents the extensive efforts of researchers so far to understand the molecular roles of the CC proteins with regard to its main function in the FA pathway, the monoubiquitination of FANCD2 and FANCI.

Recent studies show overlap between Fanconi anemia (FA) proteins and those involved in DNA repair mediated by homologous recombination (HR). However, the mechanism by which FA proteins affect HR is unclear. FA proteins (FancA/C/E/F/G/L) form a multiprotein complex, which is responsible for DNA damage-induced FancD2 monoubiquitination, a key event for cellular resistance to DNA damage. Here, we show that FANCD2-disrupted DT40 chicken B-cell line is defective in HR-mediated DNA double-strand break (DSB) repair, as well as gene conversion at the immunoglobulin light-chain locus, an event also mediated by HR. Gene conversions occurring in mutant cells were associated with decreased nontemplated mutations. In contrast to these defects, we also found increased spontaneous sister chromatid exchange (SCE) and intact Rad51 foci formation after DNA damage. Thus, we propose that FancD2 promotes a subpathway of HR that normally mediates gene conversion by a mechanism that avoids crossing over and hence SCEs.

Monoubiquitination of the Fanconi anaemia protein FANCD2 is a key event leading to repair of interstrand cross-links. It was reported earlier that FANCD2 co-localizes with NBS1. However, the functional connection between FANCD2 and MRE11 is poorly understood. In this study, we show that inhibition of MRE11, NBS1 or RAD50 leads to a destabilization of FANCD2. FANCD2 accumulated from mid-S to G2 phase within sites containing single-stranded DNA (ssDNA) intermediates, or at sites of DNA damage, such as those created by restriction endonucleases and laser irradiation. Purified FANCD2, a ring-like particle by electron microscopy, preferentially bound ssDNA over various DNA substrates. Inhibition of MRE11 nuclease activity by Mirin decreased the number of FANCD2 foci formed in vivo. We propose that FANCD2 binds to ssDNA arising from MRE11-processed DNA double-strand breaks. Our data establish MRN as a crucial regulator of FANCD2 stability and function in the DNA damage response.

The Fanconi anemia (FA) network is important for the repair of interstrand DNA cross-links. A key event in FA pathway activation is the monoubiquitylation of the FA complementation group I (FANCI)-FANCD2 (ID) complex by FA complementation group L (FANCL), an E3 ubiquitin ligase. In this study, we show that RAD18, another DNA damage-activated E3 ubiquitin ligase, also participates in ID complex activation by ubiquitylating proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA) on Lys164, an event required for the recruitment of FANCL to chromatin. We also found that monoubiquitylated PCNA stimulates FANCL-catalyzed FANCD2 and FANCI monoubiquitylation. Collectively, these experiments identify RAD18-mediated PCNA monoubiquitination as a central hub for the mobilization of the FA pathway by promoting FANCL-mediated FANCD2 monoubiquitylation.

Fanconi anemia is an autosomal recessive syndrome characterized by diverse clinical symptoms, hypersensitivity to DNA crosslinking agents, chromosomal instability and susceptibility to cancer. Fanconi anemia has at least 11 complementation groups (A, B, C, D1, D2, E, F, G, I, J, L); the genes mutated in 8 of these have been identified. The gene BRCA2 was suggested to underlie complementation group B, but the evidence is inconclusive. Here we show that the protein defective in individuals with Fanconi anemia belonging to complementation group B is an essential component of the nuclear protein 'core complex' responsible for monoubiquitination of FANCD2, a key event in the DNA-damage response pathway associated with Fanconi anemia and BRCA. Unexpectedly, the gene encoding this protein, FANCB, is localized at Xp22.31 and subject to X-chromosome inactivation. X-linked inheritance has important consequences for genetic counseling of families with Fanconi anemia belonging to complementation group B. Its presence as a single active copy and essentiality for a functional Fanconi anemia-BRCA pathway make FANCB a potentially vulnerable component of the cellular machinery that maintains genomic integrity.

ATR kinase activates the S-phase checkpoint when replication forks stall at sites of DNA damage. This event also causes phosphorylation of the Fanconi anemia (FA) protein FANCI, triggering its monoubiquitination of the key DNA repair factor FANCD2 by the FA core E3 ligase complex, thereby promoting this central pathway of DNA repair which permits replication to be restarted. However, the interplay between ATR and the FA pathway has been unclear. In this study, we present evidence that their action is directly linked, gaining insights into this relationship in a DT40 mutant cell line that is conditionally deficient in the critical ATR-binding partner protein ATRIP. Using this system, we showed that ATRIP was crucial for DNA damage-induced FANCD2 monoubiquitination and FANCI phosphorylation. ATR kinase phosphorylated recombinant FANCI protein in vitro, which was facilitated by the presence of FANCD2. Mechanistic investigations revealed that the RPA region but not the TopBP1 region of ATRIP was required for FANCD2 monoubiquitination, whereas Chk1 phosphorylation relied upon both domains. Together, our findings identify ATR as the kinase responsible for activating the FA pathway of DNA repair.

Fanconi anemia (FA) is characterized by congenital abnormalities, bone marrow failure, chromosome fragility, and cancer susceptibility. Eight FA-associated genes have been identified so far, the products of which function in the FA/BRCA pathway. A key event in the pathway is the monoubiquitination of the FANCD2 protein, which depends on a multiprotein FA core complex. In a number of patients, spontaneous genetic reversion can correct FA mutations, leading to somatic mosaicism. We analyzed the FA/BRCA pathway in 53 FA patients by FANCD2 immunoblots and chromosome breakage tests. Strikingly, FANCD2 monoubiquitination was detected in peripheral blood lymphocytes (PBLs) in 8 (15%) patients. FA reversion was further shown in these patients by comparison of primary fibro-blasts and PBLs. Reversion was associated with higher blood counts and clinical stability or improvement. Once constitutional FANCD2 patterns were determined, patients could be classified based on the level of FA/BRCA pathway disruption, as "FA core" (upstream inactivation; n = 47, 89%), FA-D2 (n = 4, 8%), and an unidentified downstream group (n = 2, 4%). FA-D2 and unidentified group patients were therefore relatively common, and they had more severe congenital phenotypes. These results show that specific analysis of the FA/BRCA pathway, combined with clinical and chromosome breakage data, allows a comprehensive characterization of FA patients.
