Non-motor symptoms (NMSs) are a real burden in Parkinson's disease (PD). They may appear in early pre-symptomatic stage as well as throughout the disease course. However, their relationship with the deterioration of the patient's quality of life (QoL) is still under debate. This study aimed to investigate the prevalence of NMSs and their impact on the QoL in a cohort of Moroccan patients. We carried out a cross-transactional study, where a total of 117 patients were submitted to a structured clinical interview and examination investigating motor and NMSs based on common and conventional scales. Motor symptoms were assessed by the UPDRS I-VI during ON condition. The NMSs were evaluated with common scales and their relationship with the QoL was investigated. The mean patient's age was 60.77 ± 11.36 years old, and the median disease duration was 6 years [2.5-9.5]. Motor's phenotype subtypes were the mixed form in 40.2% of patients, akinetic-rigid in 20.5% and a tremor-dominant form in 39.3%. The median Hoehn and Yahr staging was 2 [1-2.5]. Regarding NMSs, the most common were urinary dysfunctions (82.6%), sleep (80.6%), and gastrointestinal (80%) disorders. Other autonomic dysfunctions were also frequent: thermoregulatory dysfunctions 58.6%, cardiovascular troubles 50.9%, and sexual dysfunctions 47.9%. Depression was present in 47.9% and fatigue symptoms in 23.1%. The median score of SCOPA-AUT was 14 [7.75-21.80]. The median PD questionnaire 39-score index (PDQ39-SI) was 23.22% and the most affected dimension was "mobility." Univariate and multivariate analyses showed that the SCOPA-AUT score impacted the QoL (<i>p</i> = 0.001), especially the gastrointestinal (<i>p</i> = 0.007), and cardiovascular (<i>p</i> = 0.049) dimensions. Our data show that all patients have presented at least one NMS. Autonomic and sleep disorders were the most frequent, and in contrast to other studies, digestive and cardiovascular disorders were rather the factors influencing negatively the QoL of patients. Understanding the pathophysiology of these NMSs should be placed at the forefront in order to develop new therapeutic approaches by improving the QoL of PD patients.

Manganese (Mn) is a common component of welding fume. Exposure to Mn fume has been associated with parkinsonism. A simple and reliable screening tool to evaluate Mn exposed workers for neurotoxic injury would have broad occupational health application. This study investigated 490 occupational welders recruited from a trade union list. Subjects were examined by a movement disorders specialist using the Unified Parkinson Disease Rating Scale motor subsection 3 (UPDRS3). Parkinsonism, intermediate, and normal groups were defined as UPDRS3 score ≥ 15, 6-15, and <6, respectively. Workers completed a health status questionnaire (PDQ39) and a Parkinson disease (PD) Symptoms Questionnaire. Areas under receiver operator curve (AUC) were analyzed based on these scores, adjusted for age, smoking, race, gender, and neurologist, using normal as the reference. The AUC was 0.79 (95% confidence interval [CI]=0.73-0.84) for PDQ39 and 0.78 (95% CI=0.72-0.85) for PD Symptoms Questionnaire score. At 70% sensitivity, the specificity for PDQ39 score and PD Symptoms Questionnaire score for the prediction of parkinsonism was 73.1% and 80.1%, respectively. These results suggest the questionnaires have reasonably good sensitivity and specificity to predict parkinsonism in Mn exposed workers. These questionnaires could be a valuable first step in a tiered screening approach for Mn exposed workers.

Treatment of advanced-stage idiopathic Parkinson's disease (PD) is a demanding challenge, and in Germany, medication regimen adjustments are often made during inpatient stays. Admissions often follow an acute worsening of symptoms and functioning. In order to reduce long and expensive inpatient stays, and to provide more frequent consultations, a 24/7 live stream telemedicine home treatment service was established. A pilot study was conducted in which laptops were distributed to 50 patients for 1 year to see whether such a service was feasible (in terms of patient participation and compliance) and whether this intervention affected the patient's condition, measured in UPDRS, Mini-Mental Status Examination (MMSE), 39-item Parkinson's Disease Questionnaire (PDQ39), and H & Y Scale. Seventy-two percent (36) of the patients were compliant and did not experience technical issues. Patients lived, on average, 198 ± 183 km away from the specialist clinic. In total, 264 video conversations took place with 6.9 ± 7.2 (0-29) calls per patient. We found a significant improvement in PDQ39 scores, but not in UPDRS, MMSE, or H & Y scores, at 1 year. Our data shows that 24/7 live stream telemedicine is feasible and can help to improve quality of life. However, a detailed preliminary review of the patient's willingness to use such a service should be made to obtain the best results. Improvement of the technical setup and network coverage would facilitate an improved service and increase efficiency.

A body of literature now exists, which demonstrates that idiopathic Parkinson's disease (PD) has a major negative impact on quality of life (QoL), and that depression and cognitive impairment are among the main predictors of poor QoL in this disorder. Relatively little work has been done to assess the differential contribution of the specific symptoms of PD to QoL, which was the aim of this study. One hundred thirty patients with PD completed a booklet of questionnaires, which included the PDQ39 as a disease-specific measure of QoL, a symptom checklist, a mobility checklist, as well as patient ratings of disease stage and disability. The results indicated that the contribution of physical, medication-related, and cognitive/psychiatric symptoms to QoL can be significant. Sudden unpredictable on/off states, difficulty in dressing, difficulty in walking, falls, depression, and confusion were PD symptoms, which significantly influenced QoL scores. Among the mobility problems associated with PD, start hesitation, shuffling gait, freezing, festination, propulsion, and difficulty in turning had a significant effect on QoL scores. In addition to depression and anxiety, the major predictors of QoL were shuffling, difficulty turning, falls, difficulty in dressing, fatigue, confusion, autonomic disturbance particularly urinary incontinence, unpredictable on/off fluctuations, and sensory symptoms such as pain. The implications of these results for the medical management of PD are discussed.

In this review report, current possibilities of evaluation of quality of life in Parkinson's disease have been critically presented. Health Related Quality of Life (-HRQoL) comprises a wide spectrum of consequences of the disease. Measurement of quality of life has become increasingly relevant as an outcome parameter, especially in long-term trials. Most of the available QoL instruments depend on patient self-reports. The data can be collected by written questionnaires. There are universal questionnaires of QoL--for many diseases and the specific ones--specially created for one disease. Among universal questionnaires, the Sickness Impact Profile (SIP) and the Short-Form Health Status Survey (SF-36) are the most popular in Parkinson's disease. As for specific questionnaires: the Parkinson`s Disease Questionnaire (PDQ-39) and the Parkinson's Disease Quality of Life Questionnaire (PDQL) have been described.

The use of complementary and alternative medicine (CAM) therapy in nonmotor symptoms (NMS) for Parkinson disease (PD) is growing worldwide. Well-performed, systematic evidence-based research is largely lacking in this area and many studies include various forms of CAM with small patient numbers and a lack of standardization of the approaches studied. Taichi, Qigong, dance, yoga, mindfulness, acupuncture, and other CAM therapies are reviewed and there is some evidence for the following: Taichi in sleep and PDQ39; dance in cognition, apathy, and a mild trend to improved fatigue; yoga in PDQ39; and acupuncture in depression, PDQ39, and sleep. Exercise including occupational therapy (OT) and physical therapy (PT) has been studied in motor symptoms of PD and balance but only with small studies with a mounting evidence base for use of exercise in NMS of PD including PDQ39, sleep, fatigue, depression, and some subsets of cognition. Studies of OT and PT largely show some benefit to depression, apathy, and anxiety. Sustainability of an improvement has not been shown given short duration of follow up. Finding optimal control groups and blind for these interventions is also an issue. This is a very important area of study since patients want to be self-empowered and they want guidance on which form of exercise is the best. Additionally, evidence for PT and OT in NMS would give added weight to get these interventions covered through medical insurance.

Autonomic symptoms are commonly observed in patients with Parkinson's disease (PD) and often limit the activities of daily living. The Scale for Outcomes in Parkinson's disease-Autonomic (SCOPA-AUT) was developed to evaluate and quantify autonomic symptoms in PD. The goal of this study was to translate the original SCOPA-AUT, which was written in English, into Korean and to evaluate its reliability and validity for Korean PD patients. For the translation, the following processes were performed: forward translation, backward translation, expert review, pretest of the pre-final version and development of the final Korean version of SCOPA-AUT (K-SCOPA-AUT). In total, 127 patients with PD from 31 movement disorder clinics of university-affiliated hospitals in Korea were enrolled in this study. All patients were assessed using the K-SCOPA-AUT and other motor, non-motor, and quality of life scores. Test-retest reliability for the K-SCOPA-AUT was assessed over a time interval of 10-14 days. The internal consistency and reliability of the K-SCOPA-AUT was 0.727 as measured by the mean Cronbach's α-coefficient. The test-retest correlation reliability was 0.859 by the Guttman split-half coefficient. The total K-SCOPA-AUT score showed a positive correlation with other non-motor symptoms [the Korean version of non-motor symptom scale (K-NMSS)], activities of daily living (Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale part II) and quality of life [the Korean version of Parkinson's Disease Quality of Life 39 (K-PDQ39)]. The K-SCOPA-AUT had good reliability and validity for the assessment of autonomic dysfunction in Korean PD patients. Autonomic symptom severities were associated with many other motor and non-motor impairments and influenced quality of life.

<b>Introduction:</b> Deep brain stimulation (DBS) of the subthalamic nucleus (STN) is known as a therapy of choice of advanced Parkinson's disease. The present study aimed to assess the beneficial and side effects of STN DBS in Moroccan Parkinsonian patients. <b>Material and Methods:</b> Thirty five patients underwent bilateral STN DBS from 2008 to 2016 in the Rabat University Hospital. Patients were assessed preoperatively and followed up for 6 to 12 months using the Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale in four conditions (stimulation OFF and ON and medication OFF and ON), the levodopa-equivalent daily dose (LEDD), dyskinesia and fluctuation scores and PDQ39 scale for quality of life (QOL). Postoperative side effects were also recorded. <b>Results:</b> The mean age at disease onset was 42.31 ± 7.29 years [28-58] and the mean age at surgery was 54.66 ± 8.51 years [34-70]. The median disease duration was 11.95 ± 4.28 years [5-22]. Sixty-three percentage of patients were male. 11.4% of patients were tremor dominant while 45.71 showed akinetic-rigid form and 42.90 were classified as mixed phenotype. The LEDD before surgery was 1200 mg/day [800-1500]. All patients had motor fluctuations whereas non-motor fluctuations were present in 61.80% of cases. STN DBS decreased the LEDD by 51.72%, as the mean LEDD post-surgery was 450 [188-800]. The UPDRS-III was improved by 52.27%, dyskinesia score by 66.70% and motor fluctuations by 50%, whereas QOL improved by 27.12%. Post-operative side effects were hypophonia (2 cases), infection (3 cases), and pneumocephalus (2 cases). <b>Conclusion:</b> Our results showed that STN DBS is an effective treatment in Moroccan Parkinsonian patients leading to a major improvement of the most disabling symptoms (dyskinesia, motor fluctuation) and a better QOL.

Psychiatric symptoms and motor impairment are major contributions to the poor quality of life in patients with Parkinson's disease (PD). Here, we applied a novel diffusion-weighted imaging approach, diffusion MRI connectometry, to investigate the correlation of quality of life, evaluated by Parkinson's Disease Questionnaire (PDQ39) with the white matter structural connectivity in 27 non-demented PD patients (disease duration of 5.3 ± 2.9 years, H and Y stage = 1.5 ± 0.6, UPDRS-III = 13.7 ± 6.5, indicating unilateral and mild motor involvement). The connectometry analysis demonstrated bilateral posterior limbs of the internal capsule (PLIC) with increased connectivity related to the higher quality of life (FDR = 0.027) in a multiple regression model. The present study suggests for the first time a neural basis of the quality of life in PD in the light of major determinants of poor quality of life in these patients: anxiety, depression, apathy and motor impairment. Results in our sample of non-demented PD patients with relatively mild motor impairment and no apparent sign of depression/anxiety also identify a unique and inexplicable association of the PLIC to the quality of life in PD patients.

The well known global improvement of quality of life (QoL) after bilateral high frequency chronic deep brain stimulation of the subthalamic nucleus (STN DBS) in Parkinson's disease (PD) is in contrast to behavioral disturbances as observed after surgery. Indeed the impact of DBS on physical versus mental aspects of QoL in PD remains unknown. To assess the influence of bilateral STN DBS on physical versus mental aspects of QoL in Parkinson's disease. The results of 27 patients for the Unified Parkinson's disease Rating Scale (UPDRS), Parkinson's Disease Questionnaire 39 (PDQ39) and Short Form 36 health survey questionnaire (SF36) were compared before surgery and after 12 months of bilateral STN DBS. Comparing off-dopa conditions before versus 12 months after surgery, both UPDRS part II and part III significantly improved: 32.6% and 52%, respectively. UPDRS part I scores did not change significantly at 12 months. As for PDQ39, the global score significantly improved after surgery (21.1 %) as did four subscores: mobility (25.6 %), activity of daily living (34.5 %), stigma (40.1 %) and bodily discomfort (30 %). Three PDQ39 subscores, however, showed no significant changes: emotional well-being (10.7 %), social support (3.2%) and cognition (8.5 %) and one item even worsened: communication (-7.7 %). In SF36, only physical items significantly improved. Using clinician's based rating scale, bilateral STN DBS showed significant improvement in PD patients at 12 month follow up. However, using patient's self-assessment scales, the clinical benefit of STN DBS was more subtle: physical items of QoL significantly improved, whereas mental items such as emotional well-being, social support, cognition and communication showed no improvement. Our results are suggestive of a dissociation of motor and non-motor symptoms control after bilateral STN DBS in PD patients.

Patients with Parkinson's Disease (PD) undergo motor injuries, which decrease their quality of life (QL). Dance, added to drug therapy, can help treating these patients AIMS: To conduct a systematic review with meta-analysis with the aim to analyze the effects of dance classes in comparison to other interventions or to the absence of intervention, in randomized clinical trials (RCTs), on functional mobility, motor symptoms and QL of PD patients METHODS: The search was conducted in MEDLINE, LILACS, SciELO, Cochrane and PsycINFO (last searched in August 2017). RCTs analyzing dance effects in comparison to other physical training types or to no intervention, on functional mobility, motor symptoms and QL of PD patients were selected. The outcomes assessed were motor symptoms with Unified PD Rating Scale III (UPDRSIII), functional mobility with Timed Up and Go Test (TUG), endurance with 6 min walking test (6MWT), freezing of gait with Freezing of Gait Questionnaire (FOG_Q), walking velocity with GAITRite and QL with PD Questionnaire (PDQ39). Two reviewers independently extracted methodological quality and studies data. Results are presented as weighted mean differences. Five RCTs were included, totaling 159 patients. Dance promoted significant improvements on UPDRSIII, and a decrease in TUG time when compared to other types of exercise. In comparison to the absence of intervention, dance practice also showed significant improvements in motor scores. Dance can improve motor parameters of the disease and patients' functional mobility.

Quality of life (QoL) is the sense of well-being perceived by people. The improvement of parkinsonian patient's QoL is a crucial goal for clinicians involved in rehabilitative care. In order to provide an appropriate endpoint for the assessment of the effectiveness of rehabilitation treatments on QoL of patients with Parkinson's Disease (PD), in this study we have first translated and then validated the Belastungsfragebogen Parkinson kurzversion (BELA-P-k). This tool allows evaluating separately two crucial aspects: i) the loss of personal autonomy in activities of daily life and ii) the psychological and psychosocial impact of the disease. The BELA-P-k was translated from Dutch into Italian. Subsequently 202 PD patients filled out the questionnaire. Patients were also evaluated by using the Parkinson Disease Questionnaire -39 (PDQ39), the Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale (UPDRS), the Mini Mental State Examination (MMSE) and the Frontal Assessment Battery (FAB). The internal consistency for total of two different scores <i>Bothered by</i> (Bb) and <i>Need for Help</i> (NfH) was excellent (<i>p</i> = 0.91) for both categories. The correlation between Bb and NfH categories was significant and strong, very-strong, ranging from 0.78 to 0.88 (all <i>p</i> < 0.0001). Finally, the value of Spearman r for the relationship between Bb and NfH items and PDQ 39 values were significant (<i>p</i> ≤ 0.003). In conclusion, we validated the BELA-P-k and demonstrated that it is an appropriate and potentially useful tool for assessing QoL in the management of PD. This trial was retrospectively registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT03073044.

It is common in medicine to titrate therapy according to target ranges of objectively measured parameters. Objective measurement of motor function is available for Parkinson's Disease (PD), making it possible to optimise therapy and clinical outcomes. In this study, an accelerometry based measurement and predefined target ranges were used to assess motor function in a Northern Tasmania PD cohort managed by a Movement Disorder clinic. Approximately 40% (<i>n</i> = 103) of the total PD population participated in this study and motor scores were within target in 22%. In the 78% above target, changes in oral therapy were recommended in 74%, Advanced Therapy in 12% and treatment was contraindicated in 9%. Following changes in oral therapy, there was a further objective measurement and clinical consultation to establish whether scores had reached target range: if so subjects left the study, otherwise further changes of therapy were recommended (unless contraindications were present). Seventy-seven cases completed the study, with 48% achieving target (including 22% at outset), Advanced Therapy recommended in 19% and contraindications preventing any change in therapy in 17%. In the 43% of cases in whom oral therapy was changed, total UPDRS improved significantly (effect size = 8) as did the PDQ39 in cases reaching target. NMS Quest and MOCA scores also improved significantly. This study shows that many people in a representative cohort of PD would benefit from objective assessment and treatment of their PD features against a target.

Progressive resistance exercise (PRE) can have a positive effect in individuals with Parkinson's disease (PD). However, the effect of PRE may vary with the clinical subtype of PD. To date, no study has assessed the effects of PRE in the different subtypes of PD. The aim of the present study was to assess the effects of PRE in PD patients with akinesia and rigidity (AR-subtype). A randomized controlled trial was conducted. Outpatients clinics of the Bierzo Parkinson Association (Ponferrada, Spain) and the Asturias Parkinson Association (Oviedo, Spain). Twenty-eight patients with AR-subtype PD were randomized into an Experimental Group (EG, N.=13) and Control Group (CG, N.=15). Static posturography (Centre of Pressure -CoP- parameters), gait (the Ten-Meter Walk Test [TMWT]), freezing of gait (the Freezing of Gait Questionnaire [FOG-Q]), the motor portion of the Movement Disorders Society-Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale (MDS-UPDRS) and patient-perceived quality of life (the 39-item Parkinson's disease Questionnaire [PDQ39]), were assessed at pre-test, post-test, and re-test. Ratings of perceived exertion (RPE) (Borg >6-20 Scale) were recorded at the end of each PRE training session. The EG displayed significant ameliorations in Length (CoP parameters) from pre- to post-test (P=0.048), in speed of fast rhythm walking (TMWT) from pre- to post-test (P=0.000), and from pre- to re-test (P=0.027), and in the PDQ39 Score from pre- to post-test (P=0.024). No significant differences were detected in Area or Speed (CoP parameters), speed of preferred rhythm walking (TMWT), FOG-Q scores, or the motor portion of the MDS-UPDRS scores. The EG reported a mean RPE of 9.95 (between "very light" and "fairly light") for the whole training program. These findings provide support for the use of PRE training in the rehabilitation of individuals with AR-subtype PD, as it can improve static posturography, gait, and quality of life. Furthermore, RPE scores showed that individuals with AR-subtype PD consider that PRE training require only light efforts. The PRE training can be a helpful and fruitful rehabilitation tool for AR-subtype PD patients.

The psychometric properties of the Dutch version of the Parkinson's disease questionnaire 39 (PDQ39-DV) were tested in 177 patients with Parkinson's disease (PD). Internal consistency of 7 of the 8 scales was adequate (>or=0.70), but was insufficient for 'bodily discomfort' (0.59). Correlation between the PDQ39 and other instruments in this study, the SCOPA-psychosocial questionnaire, Euroqol-5D, hospital anxiety and depression scale, and a visual analogue scale for quality of life, were 0.82, 0.74, 0.63 and -0.54, respectively. The factor analysis yielded 8 factors, which accounted for 65% of the variance and revealed only small differences with the original UK version. We conclude that the PDQ39-DV displays satisfactory psychometric properties and is an appropriate instrument to assess quality of life in Dutch patients with PD.

Parkinson's disease is a disabling and progressive neurological condition characterized by multiple motor and non motor symptoms that contribute to deterioration in quality of life. The diversity of symptoms associated with the disease and its management affect the patients on their physical, social and mental quality of life. The aim of this study was to identify key dimensions of health related quality of life (HRQOL) in a population affected with Parkinson's disease with a degree of mild-moderate impairment. Thirty six patients with Parkinson were recruited. The Hoehn and Yarh scale, the Unified Parkinson's Disease Rate Scale, the scale of activities of daily life and Schwab & England Get Up & Go Test were applied. HRQOL was assessed with the EuroQol-5D and the specific questionnaire Parkinson's Disease Questionnaire-39 items. The dimensions of the PDQ-39, except the PDQ-39 Pain domain and the EuroQol-5D correlated significantly with the severity of the disease. HRQOL was correlated with the functional status of patients. Only the PDQ-39 pain domain correlated with the risk of falls. Our results suggest that the HRQOL of patients with PD, in a state of mild-moderate impairment, is strongly influenced by disease severity and functional status.

To investigate the efficacy and the rate of adverse events of chronic low-dose levodopa-carbidopa therapy in Japanese patients with Parkinson's disease (PD). A total of 92 Japanese PD patients treated with low doses of levodopa from the outset were studied. Both disease-specific motor disabilities and quality of life (QOL) in the patients were evaluated using the Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale (UPDRS) and the Parkinson's Disease 39 Quality of Life Questionnaire (PDQ39), respectively. In the overall patient group, the mean duration of treatment, the mean daily dose of levodopa, the disability scores and the motor scores of UPDRS were 6.2 years, 186.4 mg, 8.0 and 19.2, respectively. The rates of motor fluctuations, dyskinesias and hallucinations were 8.7%, 6.5% and 14.1%, respectively. The mean summary index of PDQ39 scores was 23.1. Patients with motor fluctuations showed a significantly earlier disease onset. Dose of levodopa, age at onset, and treatment duration were not associated with the occurrence of dyskinesias. Patients with hallucination had higher doses of levodopa and dopamine agonist. Our results demonstrate that chronic administration of a low-dose levodopa preparation can provide satisfactory benefit with a low incidence of motor complications, and can result in good QOL in Japanese patients with PD. The concomitant use of a small amount of dopamine agonist and amantadine from the outset has partly contributed to a reduced dose of levodopa and the lesser occurrence of motor complications.

Sleep problems commonly occur in patients with Parkinson's disease (PD), and are associated with a lower quality of life. The aim of the current study was to translate the English version of the Scales for Outcomes in Parkinson's Disease-Sleep (SCOPA-S) into the Korean version of SCOPA-S (K-SCOPA-S), and to evaluate its reliability and validity for use by Korean-speaking patients with PD. In total, 136 patients with PD from 27 movement disorder centres of university-affiliated hospitals in Korea were enrolled in this study. They were assessed using SCOPA, Hoehn and Yahr Scale (HYS), Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale (UPDRS), Parkinson's Disease Sleep Scale 2nd version (PDSS-2), Non-motor Symptoms Scale (NMSS), Montgomery Asberg Depression Scale (MADS), 39-item Parkinson's Disease Questionnaire (PDQ39), Neurogenic Orthostatic Hypotension Questionnaire (NOHQ), and Rapid Eye Movement Sleep Behaviour Disorder Questionnaire (RBDQ). The test-retest reliability was assessed over a time interval of 10-14 days. The internal consistency (Cronbach's α-coefficients) of K-SCOPA-S was 0.88 for nighttime sleep (NS) and 0.75 for daytime sleepiness (DS). Test-retest reliability was 0.88 and 0.85 for the NS and DS, respectively. There was a moderate correlation between the NS sub-score and PDSS-2 total score. The NS and DS sub-scores of K-SCOPA-S were correlated with motor scale such as HYS, and non-motor scales such as UPDRS I, UPDRS II, MADS, NMSS, PDQ39, and NOHQ while the DS sub-score was with RBDQ. The K-SCOPA-S exhibited good reliability and validity for the assessment of sleep problems in the Korean patients with PD.

Non-motor symptoms are common in Parkinson's disease (PD), and are the primary cause of disability in many PD patients. Our aim in this study was to translate the origin non-motor symptoms scale for PD (NMSS), which was written in English, into Korean (K-NMSS), and to evaluate its reliability and validity for use with Korean-speaking patients with PD. In total, 102 patients with PD from 9 movement disorders sections of university teaching hospitals in Korea were enrolled in this study. They were assessed using the K-NMSS, the Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale (UPDRS), the Korean version of the Mini-Mental Status Examination (K-MMSE), the Korean version of the Montgomery-Asberg Depression Rating Scale (K-MADS), the Epworth Sleepiness Scale (ESS), and Parkinson's Disease Questionnaire 39 (PDQ39). Test-retest reliability was assessed over a time interval of 10-14 days in all but one patient. The K-NMSS was administered to 102 patients with PD. The internal consistency and reliability of this tool was 0.742 (mean Cronbach's α-coefficient). The test-retest correlation reliability was 0.941 (Guttman split-half coefficient). There was a moderate correlation between the total K-NMSS score and the scores for UPDRS part I [Spearman's rank correlation coefficient, (rS)=0.521, p<0.001] and UPDRS part II (rS=0.464, p=0.001), but there was only a weak correlation between the total K-NMSS score and the UPDRS part III score (rS=0.288, p=0.003). The total K-NMSS score was significantly correlated with the K-MADS (rS=0.594, p<0.001), K-MMSE (rS=-0.291, p=0.003), and ESS (rS=0.348, p<0.001). The total K-NMSS score was also significantly and positively correlated with the PDQ39 score (rS=0.814, p<0.001). The K-NMSS exhibited good reliability and validity for the assessment of non-motor symptoms in Korean PD patients.

This study explored whether reflexology could improve or sustain the wellbeing of people with Parkinosn's Disease [PD] using the PDQ39 wellbeing tool designed specifically for use with people with PD. The treatmnt protocal involved giving 8 therapy sessions to 16 people with varying derees of PD in a cross-over design to enable a longitudinal survey of impact. Whilst the results reflected the progressive nature of PD deterioration over time there was an improvement in wellbeing over the active therapy phase. These results suggest that continuous two- three weekly reflexology may limit further deteroration or maintain improvement of wellbeing. A further study is indicated to study this hypothesis.

We investigated the impact of subthalamic nucleus (STN) deep brain stimulation (DBS) on quality of life (QOL) in patients with advanced Parkinson's disease, as self-assessed before and after surgery by completing the Parkinson's Disease Questionnaire (PDQ39). In addition to this prospective evaluation, we asked patients postoperatively to evaluate their preoperative QOL. In the prospective assessment, results showed that patients perceived a general improvement of QOL after the STN DBS. However, when evaluated retrospectively, they tended to overestimate their preoperative functioning, therefore obscuring the improvement found prospectively. This observation highlights the impact of the method used on obtained results when assessing the effects of STN DBS.
