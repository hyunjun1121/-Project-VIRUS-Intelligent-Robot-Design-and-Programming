What is the role of fucokinase?

[PMID: 12056818]
Fucose is a major component of complex carbohydrates. L-Fucose kinase (fucokinase) takes part in the salvage pathway for reutilization of fucose from the degradation of oligosaccharides. The amino acid sequence of human fucokinase was derived from a cDNA encoding a protein of hitherto unidentified function. Human fucokinase polypeptide chain consists of 990 amino acids with a predicted molecular mass of 107 kDa. The C-terminal part of its amino acid sequence showed sequence motifs typical for sugar kinases. Fucokinase full-length protein and a deletion mutant lacking the first 363 amino acids of the N-terminus were expressed in Escherichia coli BL21 cells. Both proteins displayed fucokinase activity. These results reveal that the discovered cDNA encodes the fucokinase protein and they confirm that a functional kinase domain is located in the C-terminal part of the enzyme.

FUK encodes fucokinase, the only enzyme capable of converting L-fucose to fucose-1-phosphate, which will ultimately be used for synthesizing GDP-fucose, the donor substrate for all fucosyltransferases. Although it is essential for fucose salvage, this pathway is thought to make only a minor contribution to the total amount of GDP-fucose. A second pathway, the major de novo pathway, involves conversion of GDP-mannose to GDP-fucose. Here we describe two unrelated individuals who have pathogenic variants in FUK and who presented with severe developmental delays, encephalopathy, intractable seizures, and hypotonia. The first individual was compound heterozygous for c.667T>C (p.Ser223Pro) and c.2047C>T (p.Arg683Cys), and the second individual was homozygous for c.2980A>C (p.Lys994Gln). Skin fibroblasts from the first individual confirmed the variants as loss of function and showed significant decreases in total GDP-[<sup>3</sup>H] fucose and [<sup>3</sup>H] fucose-1-phosphate. There was also a decrease in the incorporation of [5,6-<sup>3</sup>H]-fucose into fucosylated glycoproteins. Lys994 has previously been shown to be an important site for ubiquitin conjugation. Here, we show that loss-of-function variants in FUK cause a congenital glycosylation disorder characterized by a defective fucose-salvage pathway.
