The pharmacologic management of type 2 diabetes has changed dramatically in the past two decades. We have moved from a situation of only having two choices, insulin and sulfonylureas, to a position of myriad choices from 11 categories of medications (insulin, sulfonylureas, biguanides, α-glucosidase inhibitors, gliptins (dipeptidyl peptidase 4 [DPP IV] inhibitors), bromocriptine, glucagon-like peptide analogues, thiazolidinediones, glinides, amylin analogues and bile acid sequestrants. One of the most recent additions to this list are the DPP IV inhibitors commonly known as gliptins. Currently, there are four DPP IV inhibitors available in various countries-alogliptin, sitagliptin, vildagliptin and saxagliptin (1). Of these, two have been approved for clinical use in the United States: sitagliptin and saxagliptin. Additionally, linagliptin, vildagliptin and alogliptin are currently in phase III development in the United States while studies with another DPP IV inhibitor, dutogliptin, have been terminated (2). Alogliptin was approved for use in Japan under the trade name Nesina® in April 2010 (3). This manuscript will review alogliptin, its chemistry, pharmacokinetics/pharmacodynamics, drug interactions, clinical trials and its current state of FDA review. Preclinical animal data have been reviewed elsewhere and will not be outlined in this manuscript. The interested reader is referred to those recent reviews (4, 5).

Recently, the SAVOR TIMI-53 (Saxagliptin Assessment of Vascular Outcomes Recorded in patients with diabetes mellitus--Thrombolysis in Myocardial Infarction-53) reported a significant increase in the risk of hospitalizations for heart failure in patients treated with saxagliptin in comparison with placebo. Aim of the present meta-analysis is the systematic collection and synthesis of information on treatment-emergent cases of acute heart failure described in randomized clinical trials with DPP4. An extensive Medline, Embase, and Cochrane Database search for "vildagliptin", "sitagliptin", "saxagliptin", "alogliptin", "linagliptin", and "dutogliptin" was performed, collecting all randomized clinical trials on humans up to October 1st, 2013. Studies were included if they satisfied the following criteria: i) randomized trials, ii) duration ≥24 weeks; iii) on type 2 diabetes; iv) comparison of DPP4i with placebo or active drugs. The principal outcome was the effect of DPP4i on the incidence of acute heart failure. A total of 84 eligible trials was identified. The overall risk of acute heart failure was higher in patients treated with DPP4i in comparison with those treated with placebo/active comparators (MH-OR: 1.19[1.03; 1.37]; p = 0.015). When trials with non-cardiovascular outcomes were analysed separately no signal of risk was detectable. Available data from RCTs suggest that DPP4i could be associated with an increased risk of heart failure, without any clear evidence of differences among drugs of the class. Although it is plausible that the risk is greater in some sub-populations of patients, current evidence is not yet sufficient to identify susceptible patients.

We assessed the efficacy of dipeptidyl peptidase-4 (DPP-4) inhibitors vildagliptin, sitagliptin, saxagliptin and alogliptin to reach the haemoglobin HbA1c target of <7% in people with type 2 diabetes. We conducted an electronic search for randomized controlled trials (RCTs) involving DPP-4 inhibitors through September 2010. RCTs were included if they lasted at least 12 weeks, included 30 patients or more and reported the proportion of patients reaching the HbA1c target of <7%. A total of 43 RCTs reporting 52 comparisons met the selection criteria, which included 19 101 study participants evaluated for the primary endpoint, 10 467 treated with a DPP-4 inhibitor and 8634 treated with placebo or a comparator drug. DPP-4 inhibitors showed a statistically significant reduction in HbA1c compared to placebo and approximately 40% of participants achieved the HbA1c goal of <7%: this was associated with weight neutrality and no greater hypoglycaemia. The reduction of the HbA1c level and the rate of HbA1c goal attainment was not different from comparator drugs, with similar hypoglycaemia, and different effect on weight owing to the nature of comparator (metformin, sulfonylurea or glitazones). Baseline HbA1c was the best predictor for achievement of A1C target (overall weighted r(2) value = 0.410, p < 0.001). A greater proportion of type 2 diabetic patients can achieve the HbA1c goal <7% with DPP-4 inhibitors compared to placebo, with no weight gain, and no hypoglycaemic risk when used alone; DPP-4 inhibitors were not different from comparator drugs.

Inhibitors of dipeptidylpeptidase IV (DPP-IV) represent a novel class of frequently used anti-diabetic drugs. In addition to its function in metabolic regulation, DPP-IV also plays a role in the immune system. Whether the DPP-IV inhibitors sitagliptin, vildagliptin or saxagliptin impair immune responses is, however, currently unknown. Here, we investigated the effect of these agents on both innate and adaptive immunity. We found that the DPP-IV inhibitors did not affect the innate immune response induced by Toll-like receptor (TLR) ligands, as cytokine secretion and induction of co-stimulatory molecules by human blood mononuclear cells was not impaired. Furthermore, proliferation of T cells and suppressive function of regulatory T cells was preserved. Mice treated with vildagliptin showed normal cytokine production, immune cell activation and lymphocyte trafficking upon TLR activation. Thus, crucial immunological parameters remain unaffected upon treatment with DPP-IV inhibitors, a fact that is reassuring with respect to safety of these drugs.

Lipid profile is an important determinant of cardiovascular risk in type 2 diabetic patients. Available glucose-lowering agents can affect lipid levels. Dipeptidyl peptidase-4 (DPP-4) inhibitors have been reported to reduce total cholesterol, but results are inconsistent across trials. The present metaanalysis was designed to assess the effect of DPP-4 inhibitors on blood lipids, verifying possible differences across compounds of this class. An extensive search of Medline and the Cochrane Library (any date up to December 31, 2010, restricted to randomized clinical trials, published in English) was performed for all trials containing, in any field, the words "sitagliptin," "vildagliptin," "saxagliptin," "alogliptin," "linagliptin," and/or "dutogliptin." Completed but unpublished trials were identified through a search of the ClinicalTrials.gov website, using the same keywords as above. Differences in the endpoint levels and absolute or percent variations of lipids were assessed. A metaregression was performed on the trials specified above to assess the effect of putative moderators on the effect of DPP-4 inhibitors on plasma lipids, considering all drugs together and each one separately. Although the number of trials of appropriate size and duration was high (n=53), only a small fraction of those (n=17) reported data on endpoint total, high-density lipoprotein, and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol, and triglyceride. The difference-in-means for endpoint versus baseline total cholesterol in patients on DPP-4 inhibitors treatment was significantly higher in comparison with controls, meaning that treatment with DPP-4 inhibitors is associated with a significant reduction in total cholesterol (-0.18 [-0.29; -0.06] mmol/L (-7.0 [-11.2; -2.50] mg/dL); P=0.002). This meta-analysis suggests a possible beneficial effect of DPP-4 inhibitors on cholesterol, which, although small, could contribute to the reduction of cardiovascular risk.

Three-dimensional pharmacophore hypothesis was established based on a set of known DPP-IV inhibitor using PharmaGist software program understanding the essential structural features for DPP-IV inhibitor. The various marketed or under developmental status, potential gliptins have been opted to build a pharmacophore model, e.g. Sitagliptin (MK- 0431), Saxagliptin, Melogliptin, Linagliptin (BI-1356), Dutogliptin, Carmegliptin, Alogliptin and Vildagliptin (LAF237). PharmaGist web based program is employed for pharmacophore development. Four points pharmacophore with the hydrogen bond acceptor (A), hydrophobic group (H), Spatial Features and aromatic rings (R) have been considered to develop pharmacophoric features by PharmaGist program. The best pharmacophore model bearing the Score 16.971, has been opted to screen on ZincPharmer database to derive the novel potential anti-diabetic ligands. The best pharmacophore bear various Pharmacophore features, including General Features 3, Spatial Features 1, Aromatic 1 and Acceptors 2. The PharmaGist employed algorithm to identify the best pharmacophores by computing multiple flexible alignments between the input ligands. The multiple alignments are generated by combining alignments pair-wise between one of the gliptin input ligands, which acts as pivot and the other gliptin as ligand. The resulting multiple alignments reveal spatial arrangements of consensus features shared by different subsets of input ligands. The best pharmacophore model has been derived using both pair-wise and multiple alignment methods, which have been weighted in Pharmacophore Generation process. The highest-scoring pharmacophore model has been selected as potential pharmacophore model. In conclusion, 3D structure search has been performed on the "ZincPharmer Database" to identify potential compounds that have been matched with the proposed pharmacophoric features. The 3D ZincPharmer Database has been matched with various thousands of Ligands hits. Those matches were screened through the RMSD and max hits per molecule. The physicochemical properties of various "ZincPharmer Database" screened ligands have been calculated by PaDELDescriptor software. The all "ZincPharmer Database" screened ligands have been filtered based on the Lipinski's rule-of-five criteria (i.e. Molecular Weight < 500, H-bond acceptor ≤ 10, H-bond donor ≤ 5, Log P ≤ 5) and were subjected to molecular docking studies to get the potential antidiabetic ligands. We have found various substituted as potential antidiabetic ligands, which can be used for further development of antidiabetic agents. In the present research work, we have covered rational of DPP-IV inhibitor based on Ligand-Based Pharmacophore detection, which is validated via the Docking interaction studies as well as Maximal Common Substructure (MCS).

Dipeptidyl peptidase-4 (DPP-4) inhibition is a well- characterized treatment for type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). The objective of this model-based meta-analysis was to describe the time course of HbA1c response after dosing with alogliptin (ALOG), saxagliptin (SAXA), sitagliptin (SITA), or vildagliptin (VILD). Publicly available data involving late-stage or marketed DPP-4 inhibitors were leveraged for the analysis. Nonlinear mixed-effects modeling was performed to describe the relationship between DPP-4 inhibition and mean response over time. Plots of the relationship between metrics of DPP-4 inhibition (ie, weighted average inhibition [WAI], time above 80% inhibition, and trough inhibition) and response after 12 weeks of daily dosing were evaluated. The WAI was most closely related to outcome, although other metrics performed well. A model was constructed that included fixed effects for placebo and drug and random effects for intertrial variability and residual error. The relationship between WAI and outcome was nonlinear, with an increasing response up to 98% WAI. Response to DPP-4 inhibitors could be described with a single drug effect. The WAI appears to be a useful index of DPP-4 inhibition related to HbA1c. Biomarker to response relationships informed by model-based meta-analysis can be leveraged to support study designs including optimization of dose, duration of therapy, and patient population.

This meta-analysis was performed to provide an update on the efficacy and safety of dipeptidyl peptidase-4 (DPP-4) inhibitors and metformin as initial combination therapy and as monotherapy in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). We conducted a search on MEDLINE, Embase and Cochrane Collaborative database for randomized controlled trials (RCTs) of DPP-4 inhibitors and metformin as initial combination therapy or as monotherapy in patients with T2DM by the end of December 2012, using the key words 'alogliptin', 'dutogliptin', 'linagliptin', 'saxagliptin', 'sitagliptin', 'vildagliptin' and 'metformin'. RCTs were selected for meta-analysis if (1) they were RCTs comparing DPP-4 inhibitors plus metformin as initial combination therapy or DPP-4 inhibitor monotherapy to metformin monotherapy, (2) duration of treatment was ≥12 weeks and (3) reported data on haemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) change, fasting plasma glucose (FPG) change, weight change, adverse cardiovascular (CV) events, hypoglycaemia or gastrointestinal adverse events (AEs). A total of eight RCTs were included. Compared with metformin monotherapy, DPP-4 inhibitors monotherapy was associated with lower reduction in HbA1c level [weighted mean differences (MD) = 0.28, 95% confidence intervals (CIs) (0.17, 0.40), p < 0.00001], lower reduction in FPG level [MD = 0.81, 95% CI(0.60, 1.02), p <0.00001], lower weight loss [MD = 1.51, 95% CI (0.89, 2.13), p < 0.00001], but lower risk of adverse CV events [risk ratio (RR) = 0.36, 95% CI (0.15, 0.85), p = 0.02], lower risk of hypoglycaemia [RR = 0.44, 95% CI (0.27, 0.72), p = 0.001] and lower risk of gastrointestinal AEs [RR = 0.63, 95% CI(0.55, 0.70), p <0.00001]. Compared with metformin monotherapy, DPP-4 inhibitors plus metformin as initial combination therapy was associated with higher reduction in HbA1c level [MD = -0.49, 95% CI (-0.57, -0.40), p < 0.00001], higher reduction in FPG level [MD = -0.80, 95% CI (-0.87, -0.74), p < 0.00001], lower weight loss [MD = 0.44, 95% CI (0.22, 0.67), p = 0.0001]; but was not associated with a further reduction in adverse CV events [RR=0.54, 95% CI (0.25, 1.19), p = 0.13], nor the higher risk of hypoglycaemia [RR = 1.04, 95% CI (0.72, 1.50), p = 0.82], nor the prolonged risk of gastrointestinal AEs [RR = 0.98, 95% CI (0.88, 1.10), p = 0.77]. DPP-4 inhibitors, which are safe and effective in controlling the blood glucose, may possibly decrease the risk of CV events in patients with T2DM. It could be a credible alternative for T2DM patients who, for some reason, cannot use metformin, or are in high risk of CV exposure. High-quality, large sample and long-term follow-up clinical trails are needed to confirm the long-term conclusions.

Patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) are generally treated with many pharmacological compounds and are exposed to a high risk of drug-drug interactions. Indeed, blood glucose control usually requires a combination of various glucose-lowering agents, and the recommended global approach to reduce overall cardiovascular risk generally implies administration of several protective compounds, including HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors (statins), antihypertensive compounds and antiplatelet agents. New compounds have been developed to improve glucose-induced beta-cell secretion and glucose control, without inducing hypoglycaemia or weight gain, in patients with T2DM. Dipeptidylpeptidase-4 (DPP-4) inhibitors are novel oral glucose-lowering agents, which may be used as monotherapy or in combination with other antidiabetic compounds, metformin, thiazolidinediones or even sulfonylureas. Sitagliptin, vildagliptin and saxagliptin are already on the market, either as single agents or in fixed-dose combined formulations with metformin. Other compounds, such as alogliptin and linagliptin, are in a late phase of development. This review summarizes the available data on drug-drug interactions reported in the literature for these five DDP-4 inhibitors: sitagliptin, vildagliptin, saxagliptin, alogliptin and linagliptin. Possible pharmacokinetic interferences have been investigated between each of these compounds and various pharmacological agents, which were selected because there are other glucose-lowering agents (metformin, glibenclamide [glyburide], pioglitazone/rosiglitazone) that may be prescribed in combination with DPP-4 inhibitors, other drugs that are currently used in patients with T2DM (statins, antihypertensive agents), compounds that are known to interfere with the cytochrome P450 (CYP) system (ketoconazole, diltiazem, rifampicin [rifampin]) or with P-glycoprotein transport (ciclosporin), or agents with a narrow therapeutic safety window (warfarin, digoxin). Generally speaking, almost no drug-drug interactions or only minor drug-drug interactions have been reported between DPP-4 inhibitors and any of these drugs. The gliptins do not significantly modify the pharmacokinetic profile and exposure of the other tested drugs, and the other drugs do not significantly alter the pharmacokinetic profile of the gliptins or exposure to these. The only exception concerns saxagliptin, which is metabolized to an active metabolite by CYP3A4/5. Therefore, exposure to saxagliptin and its primary metabolite may be significantly modified when saxagliptin is coadministered with specific strong inhibitors (ketoconazole, diltiazem) or inducers (rifampicin) of CYP3A4/5 isoforms. The absence of significant drug-drug interactions could be explained by the favourable pharmacokinetic characteristics of DPP-4 inhibitors, which are not inducers or inhibitors of CYP isoforms and are not bound to plasma proteins to a great extent. Therefore, according to these pharmacokinetic findings, which were generally obtained in healthy young male subjects, no dosage adjustment is recommended when gliptins are combined with other pharmacological agents in patients with T2DM, with the exception of a reduction in the daily dosage of saxagliptin when this drug is used in association with a strong inhibitor of CYP3A4/A5. It is worth noting, however, that a reduction in the dose of sulfonylureas is usually recommended when a DPP-4 inhibitor is added, because of a pharmacodynamic interaction (rather than a pharmacokinetic interaction) between the sulfonylurea and the DPP-4 inhibitor, which may result in a higher risk of hypoglycaemia. Otherwise, any gliptin may be combined with metformin or a thiazolidinedione (pioglitazone, rosiglitazone), leading to a significant improvement in glycaemic control without an increased risk of hypoglycaemia or any other adverse event in patients with T2DM. Finally, the absence of drug-drug interactions in clinical trials in healthy subjects requires further evidence from large-scale studies, including typical subjects with T2DM - in particular, multimorbid and geriatric patients receiving polypharmacy.

Saxagliptin and its active metabolite M2 are dipeptidyl peptidase-4 inhibitors that improve glycaemic control by preventing the inactivation of the incretin hormones glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) and glucose-dependent insulinotropic polypeptide. This increases GLP-1 levels, stimulates insulin secretion and reduces postprandial glucagon and glucose levels. In well designed, 24-week trials in treatment-naive patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus, monotherapy with oral saxagliptin 2.5 or 5 mg once daily significantly improved glycaemic control, as measured by mean glycosylated haemoglobin (HbA(1c)) levels, relative to placebo. In large, well designed, 24-week trials, combination therapy with saxagliptin 5 mg once daily plus metformin significantly improved HbA(1c) levels relative to single-agent saxagliptin or metformin in treatment-naive patients; in treatment-experienced patients with inadequate glycaemic control, the addition of saxagliptin 2.5 or 5 mg once daily to metformin, glyburide or a thiazolidinedione, significantly improved HbA(1c) levels relative to continued use of existing monotherapy. Saxagliptin as monotherapy or in combination with other oral antihyperglycaemics was generally well tolerated, with most adverse events being of mild to moderate severity. In clinical trials, the incidence of hypoglycaemic events in patients receiving saxagliptin was generally similar to that in patients receiving placebo or other oral antihyperglycaemic agents. Saxagliptin therapy was not associated with an increased risk of cardiovascular events according to pooled data from eight clinical trials. Saxagliptin generally had a weight-neutral effect.

Some observational studies reporting an increased risk of pancreatitis in association with Dipeptidyl Peptidase-4 inhibitors (DPP4i) have raised concerns on the overall safety of this class. Aim of the present meta-analysis is the systematic collection of information on pancreatitis in randomized clinical trials with DPP4i. an extensive Medline, Embase and Cochrane Database search for 'vildagliptin', 'sitagliptin', 'saxagliptin', 'alogliptin', 'linagliptin' and 'dutogliptin' was performed up to 1 March 2013. studies were included if they satisfied the following criteria: (i) randomized trials, (ii) duration ≥12 weeks, (iii) on type 2 diabetes and (iv) comparison of DPP4i with placebo or active drugs. The identification and the selection of studies, and the subsequent data extraction were performed independently by two authors. Mantel-Haenszel odds ratio with 95% Confidence Interval (MH-OR) was calculated for all the adverse events defined below. The principal outcome was the effect of DPP4i on the incidence of pancreatitis. A total of 134 eligible trials were identified. The overall risk of pancreatitis and pancreatic cancer was not different between DPP4i and comparators (MH-OR: 0.93[0.51-1.69]; p = 0.82). It should be recognized that the number of observed cases of incident pancreatitis is small and the confidence intervals of risk estimates are wide. However, the present meta-analysis do not suggest any increase in the risk of pancreatitis with DPP4i.

Meta-analyses of randomized clinical trials have reported that dipeptidyl peptidase IV (DPP-4) inhibitors are well tolerated and that the incidence of hypoglycemia with the use of DPP-4 inhibitors is similar to that observed with placebos. However, in general, provider-oriented methods using medical record reviews offer lower rates of non-serious, symptomatic adverse drug reactions (ADRs) than patient-oriented methods. Moreover, severe hypoglycemia occurred in three clinical trials using sitagliptin, but in two of these trials this phenomenon has been previously described only in the drug application data in the US. The aim of this study was to assess the profile of patient-reported symptomatic ADRs under DPP-4 inhibitor therapy and to detect risk factors for hypoglycemic and non-hypoglycemic adverse symptoms in daily clinical practice. We analyzed a subpopulation of participants in the Drug Event Monitoring (DEM) project of the Japan Pharmaceutical Association. An anonymous survey was conducted in February 2012 to assess the self-perception of adverse symptoms during a median 28 (4-88) days after the last prescription of DPP-4 inhibitors by means of interviews of pharmacists using structured questionnaires. A total of 864 males and 686 females were included. The prescribed DPP-4 inhibitors included sitagliptin (75.4 %), alogliptin (15.5 %), vildagliptin (8.8 %) and linagliptin (0.3 %). Mild hypoglycemic symptoms were reported by 34 individuals (2.2 %) receiving monotherapy of sitagliptin (10/402) or alogliptin (3/65), or combination therapy of sitagliptin (15/767) or alogliptin (6/176) with other hypoglycemic agents. In the multiple regression model, hypoglycemic symptoms were found to be significantly associated with liver disease, female sex and alcohol consumption more than three times per week. Non-hypoglycemic symptoms were reported by 57 individuals (3.7 %), the most common symptoms of which were gastrointestinal symptoms (2.1 %). Combination therapy was only found to be associated with nonhypoglycemic symptoms. The present study suggested that hypoglycemic symptoms under therapy with sitagliptin or alogliptin may be associated with liver disease, female sex and alcohol consumption, all of which are potentially capable of leading to poor gluconeogenesis because they decrease the counter-regulatory hormonal responses to hypoglycemia.

In recent years, various dipeptidyl peptidase IV (DPP-4) inhibitors have been released as therapeutic drugs for type 2 diabetes in many countries. In spite of their diverse chemical structures, no comparative studies of their binding modes in the active site of DPP-4 have been disclosed. We determined the co-crystal structure of vildagliptin with DPP-4 by X-ray crystallography and compared the binding modes of six launched inhibitors in DPP-4. The inhibitors were categorized into three classes on the basis of their binding subsites: (i) vildagliptin and saxagliptin (Class 1) form interactions with the core S1 and S2 subsites and a covalent bond with Ser630 in the catalytic triad; (ii) alogliptin and linagliptin (Class 2) form interactions with the S1' and/or S2' subsites in addition to the S1 and S2 subsites; and (iii) sitagliptin and teneligliptin (Class 3) form interactions with the S1, S2 and S2 extensive subsites. The present study revealed that the additional interactions with the S1', S2' or S2 extensive subsite may increase DPP-4 inhibition beyond the level afforded by the fundamental interactions with the S1 and S2 subsites and are more effective than forming a covalent bond with Ser630.

Highly potent DPP-4 inhibitors have been identified by hybrid compound design based on linagliptin and alogliptin. The most promising compound 2h (IC50 = 0.31 nM) exhibited 8.5-fold and 2.5-fold more potent activity than that of alogliptin (IC50 = 2.63 nM) and linagliptin (IC50 = 0.77 nM), respectively. Compound 2h had a good inhibition selectivity for DPP-4 over DPP-8/9 and thus was selected for further biological evaluation, including oral glucose tolerance, plasma DPP-4 inhibitory activity, pharmacokinetic profile, acute toxicity and hERG inhibition. The assay results showed that 2h displayed significant in vivo glucose-lowering effect and low risk of toxicity. Further studies are expected to confirm 2h as a potential drug candidate for the treatment of type 2 diabetes.

To investigate the long-term safety and efficacy of empagliflozin, a sodium glucose cotransporter 2 inhibitor; sitagliptin; and metformin in patients with type 2 diabetes. In this randomized, open-label, 78-week extension study of two 12-week, blinded, dose-finding studies of empagliflozin (monotherapy and add-on to metformin) with open-label comparators, 272 patients received 10 mg empagliflozin (166 as add-on to metformin), 275 received 25 mg empagliflozin (166 as add-on to metformin), 56 patients received metformin, and 56 patients received sitagliptin as add-on to metformin. Changes from baseline in HbA1c at week 90 were -0.34 to -0.63% (-3.7 to -6.9 mmol/mol) with empagliflozin, -0.56% (-6.1 mmol/mol) with metformin, and -0.40% (-4.4 mmol/mol) with sitagliptin. Changes from baseline in weight at week 90 were -2.2 to -4.0 kg with empagliflozin, -1.3 kg with metformin, and -0.4 kg with sitagliptin. Adverse events (AEs) were reported in 63.2-74.1% of patients on empagliflozin and 69.6% on metformin or sitagliptin; most AEs were mild or moderate in intensity. Hypoglycemic events were rare in all treatment groups, and none required assistance. AEs consistent with genital infections were reported in 3.0-5.5% of patients on empagliflozin, 1.8% on metformin, and none on sitagliptin. AEs consistent with urinary tract infections were reported in 3.8-12.7% of patients on empagliflozin, 3.6% on metformin, and 12.5% on sitagliptin. Long-term empagliflozin treatment provided sustained glycemic and weight control and was well tolerated with a low risk of hypoglycemia in patients with type 2 diabetes.

A recent treatment advance for type 2 diabetes is the oral therapy with DPP IV inhibitors. New substances of this class are in development in order to increase alternatives for treating this important metabolic disease. The reader will gain detailed pharmacological and clinical information on alogliptin, dutogliptin and linagliptin and will learn how these DPP IV inhibitors may widen the whole drug class. Possible special indications for the various DPP IV inhibitors are discussed. The DPP IV inhibitors and their current role in type 2 diabetes are highlighted. Preclinical and clinical studies of the novel DPP IV inhibitors alogliptin, dutogliptin and linagliptin, including published data since 2007, are presented and a comparison of these compounds is made. The efficacy and safety profile of DPP IV inhibitors are promising and advantageous so far. In contrast to sulfonylureas, DPP IV inhibitors do not have an intrinsic risk for causing hypoglycemia and they are body weight neutral. Their tolerability profile is good and no specific adverse reactions have been reported. Experience so far suggests that there are no safety issues associated with inhibition of DPP IV activity by itself. Novel DPP IV inhibitors with distinct properties may offer alternative choices within this drug class.

In studying the therapeutic evidence of innovative drug treatments, increasing attention is being devoted to differentiating between results that indicate no significant differences among the treatments under examination ("no proof of difference") and results that demonstrate the therapeutic equivalence among the treatments ("proof of no difference"). Our analysis was aimed at evaluating the degree of therapeutic equivalence for dipeptidylpeptidase-4 (DPP-4) inhibitors given in type 2 diabetes as monotherapy or in combination with metformin. Equivalence was determined by developing a standard Forest plot that incorporated the information on margins previously reported in randomized trials on these agents. The end point was HbA1c change from baseline; the equivalence margin was set at ±0.25% change in HbA1c. The clinical material was obtained from a systematic review on this topic. Given as monotherapy, linagliptin, sitagliptin, and vildagliptin (but not saxagliptin) met the equivalence criterion when compared with one another. Given in combination with metformin, linagliptin, saxagliptin, sitagliptin, and vildagliptin showed an equivalent effect whereas alogliptin did not satisfy the equivalence criterion. Considering the most recent therapeutic guidelines, our results are of interest particularly as regards the information on DPP-4 inhibitors in combination with metformin. Four of the five DPP-4 inhibitors under examination clearly showed to have the same effectiveness; the fifth agent-alogliptin-failed to meet the equivalence criterion, but only because its superiority could not be excluded.

Dipeptidyl peptidase-4 (DPP-4) inhibitors collectively comprise a presently unique form of disease management for persons with type 2 diabetes mellitus. The aim of this review is to compare the clinical pharmacokinetics of available DPP-4 inhibitors (alogliptin, linagliptin, saxagliptin, sitagliptin and vildagliptin) for the purpose of identifying potential selection preferences according to individual patient variables and co-morbidities. DPP-4 inhibitors are readily absorbed orally. Following oral ingestion, absorption occurs mainly in the small intestine, with median times to maximum (peak) plasma concentration ranging from 1 to 3 hours. The fraction of each dose absorbed ranges from approximately 30% with linagliptin to 75-87% for all others. Numerical differences in maximum (peak) plasma drug concentrations and areas under the plasma concentration-time curve among the DPP-4 inhibitors vary by an order of magnitude. However, functional capacity measured in terms of glucose-lowering ability remains comparable among all available DPP-4 inhibitors. Distribution of DPP-4 inhibitors is strongly influenced by both lipophilicity and protein binding. Apparent volumes of distribution (V(d)) for most agents range from 70 to 300 L. Linagliptin exhibits a V(d) of more than 1000 L, indicating widespread distribution into tissues. Binding to target proteins in plasma and peripheral tissues exerts a major influence upon broadening linagliptin distribution. DPP-4 inhibitor metabolism is widely variable, with reported terminal half-lives ranging from approximately 3 to more than 200 hours. Complex relationships between rates of receptor binding and dissociation appear to strongly influence the durations of action of those DPP-4 inhibitors with comparatively shorter half-lives. Durations of activity often are not reflective of clearance and, with the exception of vildagliptin which may be administered either once daily in the evening or twice daily, these medications are effective when used with a once-daily dosing schedule. Saxagliptin and, to a lesser extent, sitagliptin are largely metabolized by hepatic cytochrome P450 (CYP) 3A4 and 3A5 isoforms. With the exception of the primary hydroxylated metabolite of saxagliptin, which is 2-fold less potent than its parent molecule, metabolic products of hepatic biotransformation are minimally active and none appreciably contribute to either the therapeutic or the toxic effects of DPP-4 inhibitors. No DPP-4 inhibitor has been shown to inhibit or to induce hepatic CYP-mediated drug metabolism. Accordingly, the number of clinically significant drug-drug interactions associated with these agents is minimal, with only saxagliptin necessitating dose adjustment if administered concurrently with medications that strongly inhibit CYP3A4. Linagliptin undergoes enterohepatic cycling with a large majority (85%) of the absorbed dose eliminated in faeces via biliary excretion. Other DPP-4 inhibitors predominantly undergo renal excretion, with 60-85% of each dose eliminated as unchanged parent compound in the urine. Systematic reviews of clinical trials suggest that the overall efficacy of DPP-4 inhibitors in patients with type 2 diabetes generally is similar. Apart from these generalizations, pharmacokinetic distinctions that potentially influence product selection are tentative. When considered in total, data reviewed in this report suggest that the best overall balance between potency and the clinical pharmacokinetic characteristics of distribution, metabolism and elimination may be observed with linagliptin followed closely by vildagliptin, saxagliptin, sitagliptin and alogliptin.

Dipeptidyl peptidase-4 inhibitors (DPP4i) have been recently associated with increased risk of pancreatitis and cancer. The aim of the present meta-analysis of randomized clinical trials is the assessment of the effect of DPP4i on the incidence of major cardiovascular events (MACE), cancer, and pancreatitis. An extensive Medline and Embase search for 'vildagliptin', 'sitagliptin', 'saxagliptin', 'alogliptin', 'linagliptin', and 'dutogliptin' was performed, collecting all randomized clinical trials on humans up to March 1, 2011. The present meta-analysis was therefore performed including all randomized clinical trials with a duration of at least 24 weeks, enrolling patients with type 2 diabetes, comparing DPP4i with either placebo or active drugs. Completed but still unpublished trials were identified through a search of www.clinicaltrials.gov, Food and Drug Administration, and European Medicines Agency website. Fifty-three trials enrolling 20,312 and 13,569 patients for DPP4i and comparators, respectively, were included, reporting 176 malignancies, 257 MACE, and 22 pancreatitis. DPP4i, compared with placebo or other treatment, were associated with a similar risk of cancer (MH-OR 1.020 [0.742-1.402]; p = 0.90) and pancreatitis (0.786 [0.357-1.734], p = 0.55), and with a reduced risk of MACE (MH-OR 0.689 [0.528-0.899], p = 0.006). The present meta-analysis seems to exclude any relevant short term effect of DPP4i on the incidence of cancer and suggest a possible protection from cardiovascular events. This result should be interpreted with caution, as those events were not the principal endpoint, the trial duration was short, and the characteristics of patients included could be different from routine clinical practice.

The dipeptidyl peptidase-4 (DPP-4) inhibitors linagliptin, sitagliptin, saxagliptin, vildagliptin and alogliptin are being developed and have been approved for the treatment of type-2 diabetes. These agents may be used either as monotherapy for the treatment of type-2 diabetes or in combination with other anti-diabetic drugs. The present review highlights the use of linagliptin and other new (DPP-4) inhibitors in the management of type-2 diabetes. The review also highlights advantages, comparative pharmacokinetic, safety profile and other potential uses including potential newer indications of DPP-4 inhibitors and relevant patents. The other potential uses that are not restricted to diabetes include obesity, cardiovascular disease, neurological disease, hepatobiliary disease, wound healing, and other inflammatory illnesses.

To develop a nomogram for estimating the glycated haemoglobin (HbA1c) response to different dipeptidyl peptidase-4 (DPP-4) inhibitors in type 2 diabetes. A systematic review and meta-analysis of randomised controlled trials (RCTs) of DPP-4 inhibitors (vildagliptin, sitagliptin, saxagliptin, linagliptin and alogliptin) on HbA1c were conducted. Electronic searches were carried out up to December 2013. Trials were included if they were carried out on participants with type 2 diabetes, lasted at least 12 weeks, included at least 30 participants and had a final assessment of HbA1c. A random effect model was used to pool data. A nomogram was used to represent results of the metaregression model. Adults with type 2 diabetes. Any DPP-4 inhibitor (vildagliptin, sitagliptin, saxagliptin, linagliptin or alogliptin). The HbA1c response to each DPP-4 inhibitor within 1 year of therapy. We screened 928 citations and reviewed 98 articles reporting 98 RCTs with 100 arms in 24 163 participants. There were 26 arms with vildagliptin, 37 with sitagliptin, 13 with saxagliptin, 13 with linagliptin and 11 with alogliptin. For all 100 arms, the mean baseline HbA1c value was 8.05% (64 mmol/mol); the decrease of HbA1c from baseline was -0.77% (95% CI -0.82 to -0.72%), with high heterogeneity (I(2)=96%). Multivariable metaregression model that included baseline HbA1c, type of DPP-4 inhibitor and fasting glucose explained 58% of variance between studies, with no significant interaction between them. Other factors, including age, previous diabetes drugs and duration of treatment added low predictive power (<1%). The nomogram estimates the absolute HbA1c reduction from baseline using the type of DPP-4 inhibitor, baseline values of HbA1c and fasting glucose. Baseline HbA1c level and fasting glucose explain most of the variance in HbA1c change in response to DPP-4 inhibitors: each increase of 1.0% units HbA1c provides a 0.4-0.5% units greater fall.

Vildagliptin is a dipeptidyl peptidase IV inhibitor (DPP4i). Its efficacy and safety of DPP4i in Chilean real life type 2 diabetic (T2D) patients is not well known. To assess the safety profile and effectiveness of 12 weeks of treatment with Vildagliptin for glycemic control in T2D Chilean patients with a poor glycemic control. Retrospective assessment of the effects of Vildagliptin treatment during 12 weeks in 103 T2D patients aged 29 to 92 years (47% males). The main outcomes were changes in glycosylated hemoglobin and the occurrence of adverse effects. After 12 weeks of Vildagliptin use, glycosylated hemoglobin decreased from 8.3 ± 1.4 to 7.2 ± 1.1% (p < 0.01). Fasting plasma glucose and the number of hypoglycemic events also decreased significantly. No significant weight change was observed. The treatment had good compliance, tolerance and patient satisfaction. Vildagliptin treatment reduced glycosylated hemoglobin by 1.1% and was well tolerated in this group of diabetic patients.

Vildagliptin is a dipeptidyl peptidase-4 (DPP-4) inhibitor that is being evaluated in the treatment of patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus. It improves glycaemic control by inhibiting DPP-4 from inactivating the incretin hormones glucagon-like peptide-1 and glucose-dependent insulinotropic polypeptide, prolonging incretin activity in response to ingestion of nutrients. This allows for increased insulin sensitivity, decreased glucagon secretion and improved beta-cell function in a glucose-dependent manner. Glycaemic control with vildagliptin 50 or 100 mg/day, measured by a change from baseline in mean glycosylated haemoglobin (HbA(1c)) at study endpoint, was improved relative to placebo in several well designed clinical trials of vildagliptin monotherapy in patients with type 2 diabetes. In randomised active comparator studies, noninferiority of vildagliptin in reducing HbA(1c) levels from baseline was established to rosiglitazone, but not to metformin. Vildagliptin also showed efficacy in reducing HbA(1c) levels in patients with type 2 diabetes when used in combination with metformin, pioglitazone or insulin. Vildagliptin was generally well tolerated when administered alone or in combination with additional antidiabetic treatment. Gastrointestinal adverse events were mild to moderate in intensity, and occurred less frequently than with metformin. Hypoglycaemic events were rare and occurred at a similar incidence to that with placebo.

An up-to-date assessment of dipeptidyl peptidase-4 (DPP-4) inhibitors is needed to include newly available data. To assess the efficacy and safety of DPP-4 inhibitors, including sitagliptin, saxagliptin, vildagliptin, and linagliptin, in type 2 diabetes. We conducted a search of MEDLINE for randomized controlled trials (RCTs) of DPP-4 inhibitors in type 2 diabetes through November 2011, using the key terms sitagliptin, saxagliptin, vildagliptin, and linagliptin. We also searched for completed, but unpublished, trials at relevant web sites. RCTs were selected for meta-analysis if they (1) compared DPP-4 inhibitors with placebo or an antihyperglycemic agent; (2) had study duration of 12 or more weeks; (3) had 1 or more baseline and posttreatment efficacy and/or safety outcome; and (4) were published in English. In 62 evaluated articles, DPP-4 inhibitors lowered hemoglobin A(1c) (A1C) significantly more than placebo (weighted mean difference [WMD] -0.76%; 95% CI -0.83 to -0.68); however, heterogeneity was substantial (I(2) = 82%). Exclusion of Japanese trials (n = 7) resulted in a reduction of heterogeneity (I(2) = 59%). In the non-Japanese RCTs (n = 55), DPP-4 inhibitors were associated with a reduction in A1C (WMD -0.65%; 95% CI -0.71 to -0.60) but higher risk of hypoglycemia (odds ratio [OR] 1.30; 95% CI 1.00 to 1.68) compared to placebo. The 7 Japanese-specific RCTs showed a greater reduction in A1C (WMD -1.67%; 95% CI -1.89 to -1.44) and a nonsignificant increase in risk of hypoglycemia (OR 1.41; 95% CI 0.51 to 3.88) with DPP-4 inhibitors versus placebo. When comparing DPP-4 inhibitors to active comparators, the I(2) was still high after deleting Japanese studies. In these 17 active comparator trials, there was no significant difference in A1C reduction (WMD 0.04%; 95% CI -0.09 to 0.16) or risk of hypoglycemia (OR 0.60; 95% CI 0.22 to 1.61) for DPP-4 inhibitors compared to other antihyperglycemics. There were similar odds of any or serious adverse events with DPP-4 inhibitors compared to placebo, but a decreased risk compared to other antihyperglycemics. DPP-4 inhibitors were associated with a reduction in A1C with comparable safety profiles compared to placebo, but no significant difference in A1C compared to other hyperglycemics. Differences in efficacy and safety were observed between Japanese and non-Japanese patients.

There are many advantages of combining incretin therapy [glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) receptor agonists and dipeptidyl peptidase-4 (DPP-4) inhibitors] with insulin therapy as a glucose-lowering strategy in type 2 diabetes. One important advantage is the complementary mode of the mechanistic action of incretin and insulin therapy. Another advantage is the reduction in risk of hypoglycemia and weight gain when adding incretin therapy to insulin. Several clinical trials have studied the addition of GLP-1 receptor agonists [exenatide BID (twice daily), lixisenatide, albiglutide] or DPP-4 inhibitors (vildagliptin, sitagliptin, saxagliptin, alogliptin, linagliptin) to ongoing insulin therapy or adding insulin to ongoing therapy with a GLP-1 receptor agonist (liraglutide). These studies show improved glycemia in the presence of limited risk for hypoglycemia and weight gain with the combination of incretin therapy with insulin. This article reviews the background and clinical studies on this combination.

Dipeptidyl peptidase -4 inhibitors represent a novel way to augment the incretin system and one of the newest class of medications in the treatment of type 2 diabetes mellitus. Their mechanism of action is to decrease the inactivation of glucagon-like peptide 1 and glucose-dependent insulinotropic polypeptide, both of which are involved in maintaining euglycemia subsequent to carbohydrate intake. Currently investigated agents include sitagliptin, vildagliptin, saxagliptin, linagliptin, and alogliptin. Each agent has been shown to provide significant improvements in glycemic control compared to placebo. They are effective when added to other oral diabetes agents and in the cases of sitagliptin, vildagliptin, and alogliptin in addition to insulin. These agents may not provide as significant improvement in glucose concentrations as some other medications including metformin, thiazolidinediones, or glucagon-like peptide 1 agonists. The lack of head to head clinical data comparing the various dipeptidyl peptidase 4 inhibitors does not allow for specific recommendations if one agent is more effective or safer than another within the class. Their side effect profile suggests they are very well tolerated and have few drug interactions. For patients with mildly elevated glucose concentrations, they are therapeutic options in both drug-naive patients as well as those not optimally controlled on other diabetes medications.

BI 1356 [proposed trade name ONDERO; (R)-8-(3-amino-piperidin-1-yl)-7-but-2-ynyl-3-methyl-1-(4-methyl-quinazolin-2-ylmethyl)-3,7-dihydro-purine-2,6-dione] is a novel dipeptidyl peptidase (DPP)-4 inhibitor under clinical development for the treatment of type 2 diabetes. In this study, we investigated the potency, selectivity, mechanism, and duration of action of BI 1356 in vitro and in vivo and compared it with other DPP-4 inhibitors. BI 1356 inhibited DPP-4 activity in vitro with an IC(50) of approximately 1 nM, compared with sitagliptin (19 nM), alogliptin (24 nM), saxagliptin (50 nM), and vildagliptin (62 nM). BI 1356 was a competitive inhibitor, with a K(i) of 1 nM. The calculated k(off) rate for BI 1356 was 3.0 x 10(-5)/s (versus 2.1 x 10(-4)/s for vildagliptin). BI 1356 was >/=10,000-fold more selective for DPP-4 than DPP-8, DPP-9, amino-peptidases N and P, prolyloligopeptidase, trypsin, plasmin, and thrombin and was 90-fold more selective than for fibroblast activation protein in vitro. In HanWistar rats, the DPP-4 inhibition 24 h after administration of BI 1356 was more profound than with any of the other DPP-4 inhibitors. In C57BL/6J mice and Zucker fatty (fa/fa) rats, the duration of action on glucose tolerance decreased in the order BI 1356 > (sitagliptin/saxagliptin) > vildagliptin. These effects were mediated through control of glucagon-like peptide-1 and insulin. In conclusion, BI 1356 inhibited DPP-4 more effectively than vildagliptin, sitagliptin, saxagliptin, and alogliptin and has the potential to become the first truly once-a-day DPP-4 inhibitor for the treatment of type 2 diabetes.
