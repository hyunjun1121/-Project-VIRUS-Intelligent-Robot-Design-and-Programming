Which is the  subcellular localization of ERAP2?

Epithelial cell adhesion molecule (EpCAM) is an epithelial and cancer cell "marker" and there is a cumulative and growing evidence of its signaling role. Its importance has been recognized as part of the breast cancer stem cell phenotype, the tumorigenic breast cancer stem cell is EpCAM(+). In spite of its complex functions in normal cell development and cancer, relatively little is known about EpCAM-interacting proteins. We used breast cancer cell lines and performed EpCAM co-immunoprecipitation followed by mass spectrometry in search for novel potentially interacting proteins. The endoplasmic reticulum aminopeptidase 2 (ERAP2) was found to co-precipitate with EpCAM and to co-localize in the cytoplasm/ER and the plasma membrane. ERAP2 is a proteolytic enzyme set in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) where it plays a central role in the trimming of peptides for presentation by MHC class I molecules. Expression of EpCAM and ERAP2 in vitro in the presence of dog pancreas rough microsomes (ER vesicles) confirmed N-linked glycosylation, processing in ER and the size of EpCAM. The association between ERAP2 and EpCAM is a unique and novel finding that provides new ideas on EpCAM processing and on how antigen presentation may be regulated in cancer.

The human endoplasmic reticulum aminopeptidase (ERAP) 1 and 2 proteins were initially identified as homologues of human placental leucine aminopeptidase/insulin-regulated aminopeptidase. They are categorized as a unique class of proteases based on their subcellular localization on the luminal side of the endoplasmic reticulum. ERAPs play an important role in the N-terminal processing of the antigenic precursors that are presented on the major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class I molecules. ERAPs are also implicated in the regulation of a wide variety of physiological phenomena and pathogenic conditions. In this review, the current knowledge on ERAPs is summarized.

The placental leucine aminopeptidase (P-LAP), adipocyte-derived leucine aminopeptidase (A-LAP) and leukocyte-derived aminopeptidase (L-RAP) belong to one distinct group of the M1 family of amimopeptidases, which we term the "Oxytocinase subfamily". They share HEXXH(X)18E Zn-binding and GAMEN motifs essential for the enzymatic activities. Intracellular localization is the characteristic feature of the subfamily members. While P-LAP is translocated from intracellular vesicles to plasma membrane in a stimulus-dependent manner, both A-LAP and L-RAP are retained in the endoplasmic reticulum. They contain sequences necessary for the specific localization in the cell. It is getting evident that the subfamily members play important roles in the maintenance of homeostasis including maintenance of normal pregnancy, memory retention, blood pressure regulation and antigen presentation. In this review, current situation of this newly identified subfamily is summarized.
