Which gene controls the expression of GATA-1 isoforms?

[PMID: 12202480]
GATA-1 and the ets factor PU.1 have been reported to functionally antagonize one another in the regulation of erythroid versus myeloid gene transcription and development. The CCAAT enhancer binding protein epsilon (C/EBPepsilon) is expressed as multiple isoforms and has been shown to be essential to myeloid (granulocyte) terminal differentiation. We have defined a novel synergistic, as opposed to antagonistic, combinatorial interaction between GATA-1 and PU.1, and a unique repressor role for certain C/EBPepsilon isoforms in the transcriptional regulation of a model eosinophil granulocyte gene, the major basic protein (MBP). The eosinophil-specific P2 promoter of the MBP gene contains GATA-1, C/EBP, and PU.1 consensus sites that bind these factors in nuclear extracts of the eosinophil myelocyte cell line, AML14.3D10. The promoter is transactivated by GATA-1 alone but is synergistically transactivated by low levels of PU.1 in the context of optimal levels of GATA-1. The C/EBPepsilon(27) isoform strongly represses GATA-1 activity and completely blocks GATA-1/PU.1 synergy. In vitro mutational analyses of the MBP-P2 promoter showed that both the GATA-1/PU.1 synergy, and repressor activity of C/EBPepsilon(27) are mediated via protein-protein interactions through the C/EBP and/or GATA-binding sites but not the PU.1 sites. Co-immunoprecipitations using lysates of AML14.3D10 eosinophils show that both C/EBPepsilon(32/30) and epsilon(27) physically interact in vivo with PU.1 and GATA-1, demonstrating functional interactions among these factors in eosinophil progenitors. Our findings identify novel combinatorial protein-protein interactions for GATA-1, PU.1, and C/EBPepsilon isoforms in eosinophil gene transcription that include GATA-1/PU.1 synergy and repressor activity for C/EBPepsilon(27).

Mutations in the hematopoietic transcription factor GATA-1 alter the proliferation/differentiation of hemopoietic progenitors. Mutations in exon 2 interfere with the synthesis of the full-length isoform of GATA-1 and lead to the production of a shortened isoform, GATA-1s. These mutations have been found in patients with Diamond-Blackfan anemia (DBA), a congenital erythroid aplasia typically caused by mutations in genes encoding ribosomal proteins. We sequenced GATA-1 in 23 patients that were negative for mutations in the most frequently mutated DBA genes. One patient showed a c.2T > C mutation in the initiation codon leading to the loss of the full-length GATA-1 isoform.

Coexpression of PU.1 and GATA-1 is required for proper specification of the mast cell lineage; however, in the myeloid and erythroid lineages, PU.1 and GATA-1 are functionally antagonistic. In this study, we report a transcriptional network in which PU.1 positively regulates GATA-1 expression in mast cell development. We isolated a variant mRNA isoform of GATA-1 in murine mast cells that is significantly upregulated during mast cell differentiation. This isoform contains an alternatively spliced first exon (IB) that is distinct from the first exon (IE) incorporated in the major erythroid mRNA transcript. In contrast to erythroid and megakaryocyte cells, in mast cells we show that PU.1 and GATA-2 predominantly occupy potential cis-regulatory elements in the IB exon region in vivo. Using reporter assays, we identify an enhancer flanking the IB exon that is activated by PU.1. Furthermore, we observe that in PU.1(-/-) fetal liver cells, low levels of the IE GATA-1 isoform is expressed, but the variant IB isoform is absent. Reintroduction of PU.1 restores variant IB isoform and upregulates total GATA-1 protein expression, which is concurrent with mast cell differentiation. Our results are consistent with a transcriptional hierarchy in which PU.1, possibly in concert with GATA-2, activates GATA-1 expression in mast cells in a pathway distinct from that seen in the erythroid and megakaryocytic lineages.
