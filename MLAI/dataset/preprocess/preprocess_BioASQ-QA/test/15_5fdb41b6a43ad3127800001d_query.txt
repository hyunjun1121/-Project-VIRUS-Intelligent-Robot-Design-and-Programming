Cardiovascular disease accounts for millions of deaths each year and is currently the leading cause of mortality worldwide. The aging process is clearly linked to cardiovascular disease, however, the exact relationship between aging and heart function is not fully understood. Furthermore, a holistic view of cardiac aging, linking features of early life development to changes observed in old age, has not been synthesized. Here, we re-purpose RNA-sequencing data previously-collected by our group, investigating gene expression differences between wild-type mice of different age groups that represent key developmental milestones in the murine lifespan. DESeq2's generalized linear model was applied with two hypothesis testing approaches to identify differentially-expressed (DE) genes, both between pairs of age groups and across mice of all ages. Pairwise comparisons identified genes associated with specific age transitions, while comparisons across all age groups identified a large set of genes associated with the aging process more broadly. An unsupervised machine learning approach was then applied to extract common expression patterns from this set of age-associated genes. Sets of genes with both linear and non-linear expression trajectories were identified, suggesting that aging not only involves the activation of gene expression programs unique to different age groups, but also the re-activation of gene expression programs from earlier ages. Overall, we present a comprehensive transcriptomic analysis of cardiac gene expression patterns across the entirety of the murine lifespan.

Tg26 mice are robust models of human immunodeficiency virus 1 associated nephropathy (HIVAN). These mice are useful for HIVAN pathology analysis, and recent studies suggest that the Tg26 mouse model is an excellent model of other chronic kidney diseases. We performed RNA seq analysis of differential gene expression in the kidneys of Tg26 mice. Kidneys were collected from Tg26 mice and wildtype (WT) littermates at 3 months of age. The raw data were analyzed for differential gene expression using a negative binomial generalized linear model in the DeSeq2 software package. We used <i>P</i>-Value â‰¤0.05 and an absolute fold change of 1.5 to identify top 50 upregulated and top 50 downregulated differentially expressed genes between the WT and Tg26 mice. As expected inflammatory genes were among the top differentially regulated genes. Our data provides yet another level of information to help gain a more comprehensive understanding of disease progression and identify potential drug targets for HIVAN and chronic kidney diseases.

The rapid expansion of transcriptomics and affordability of next-generation sequencing (NGS) technologies generate rocketing amounts of gene expression data across biology and medicine, including cancer research. Concomitantly, many bioinformatics tools were developed to streamline gene expression and quantification. We tested the concordance of NGS RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) analysis outcomes between two predominant programs for read alignment, HISAT2, and STAR, and two most popular programs for quantifying gene expression in NGS experiments, edgeR and DESeq2, using RNA-seq data from breast cancer progression series, which include histologically confirmed normal, early neoplasia, ductal carcinoma in situ and infiltrating ductal carcinoma samples microdissected from formalin fixed, paraffin embedded (FFPE) breast tissue blocks. We identified significant differences in aligners' performance: HISAT2 was prone to misalign reads to retrogene genomic loci, STAR generated more precise alignments, especially for early neoplasia samples. edgeR and DESeq2 produced similar lists of differentially expressed genes, with edgeR producing more conservative, though shorter, lists of genes. Gene Ontology (GO) enrichment analysis revealed no skewness in significant GO terms identified among differentially expressed genes by edgeR versus DESeq2. As transcriptomics of FFPE samples becomes a vanguard of precision medicine, choice of bioinformatics tools becomes critical for clinical research. Our results indicate that STAR and edgeR are well-suited tools for differential gene expression analysis from FFPE samples.

Several R packages exist for the detection of differentially expressed genes from RNA-Seq data. The analysis process includes three main steps, namely normalization, dispersion estimation and test for differential expression. Quality control steps along this process are recommended but not mandatory, and failing to check the characteristics of the dataset may lead to spurious results. In addition, normalization methods and statistical models are not exchangeable across the packages without adequate transformations the users are often not aware of. Thus, dedicated analysis pipelines are needed to include systematic quality control steps and prevent errors from misusing the proposed methods. SARTools is an R pipeline for differential analysis of RNA-Seq count data. It can handle designs involving two or more conditions of a single biological factor with or without a blocking factor (such as a batch effect or a sample pairing). It is based on DESeq2 and edgeR and is composed of an R package and two R script templates (for DESeq2 and edgeR respectively). Tuning a small number of parameters and executing one of the R scripts, users have access to the full results of the analysis, including lists of differentially expressed genes and a HTML report that (i) displays diagnostic plots for quality control and model hypotheses checking and (ii) keeps track of the whole analysis process, parameter values and versions of the R packages used. SARTools provides systematic quality controls of the dataset as well as diagnostic plots that help to tune the model parameters. It gives access to the main parameters of DESeq2 and edgeR and prevents untrained users from misusing some functionalities of both packages. By keeping track of all the parameters of the analysis process it fits the requirements of reproducible research.

Brain gene expression profiling studies of suicide and depression using oligonucleotide microarrays have often failed to distinguish these two phenotypes. Moreover, next generation sequencing approaches are more accurate in quantifying gene expression and can detect alternative splicing. Using RNA-seq, we examined whole-exome gene and exon expression in non-psychiatric controls (CON, N=29), DSM-IV major depressive disorder suicides (MDD-S, N=21) and MDD non-suicides (MDD, N=9) in the dorsal lateral prefrontal cortex (Brodmann Area 9) of sudden death medication-free individuals post mortem. Using small RNA-seq, we also examined miRNA expression (nine samples per group). DeSeq2 identified 35 genes differentially expressed between groups and surviving adjustment for false discovery rate (adjusted P<0.1). In depression, altered genes include humanin-like-8 (MTRNRL8), interleukin-8 (IL8), and serpin peptidase inhibitor, clade H (SERPINH1) and chemokine ligand 4 (CCL4), while exploratory gene ontology (GO) analyses revealed lower expression of immune-related pathways such as chemokine receptor activity, chemotaxis and cytokine biosynthesis, and angiogenesis and vascular development in (adjusted P<0.1). Hypothesis-driven GO analysis suggests lower expression of genes involved in oligodendrocyte differentiation, regulation of glutamatergic neurotransmission, and oxytocin receptor expression in both suicide and depression, and provisional evidence for altered DNA-dependent ATPase expression in suicide only. DEXSEq analysis identified differential exon usage in ATPase, class II, type 9B (adjusted P<0.1) in depression. Differences in miRNA expression or structural gene variants were not detected. Results lend further support for models in which deficits in microglial, endothelial (blood-brain barrier), ATPase activity and astrocytic cell functions contribute to MDD and suicide, and identify putative pathways and mechanisms for further study in these disorders.

Meat color is considered to be the most important indicator of meat quality, however, the molecular mechanisms underlying traits related to meat color remain mostly unknown. In this study, to elucidate the molecular basis of meat color, we constructed six cDNA libraries from biceps femoris (Bf) and soleus (Sol), which exhibit obvious differences in meat color, and analyzed the whole-transcriptome differences between Bf (white muscle) and Sol (red muscle) using high-throughput sequencing technology. Using DEseq2 method, we identified 138 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) between Bf and Sol. Using DEGseq method, we identified 770, 810, and 476 DEGs in comparisons between Bf and Sol in three separate animals. Of these DEGs, 52 were overlapping DEGs. Using these data, we determined the enriched GO terms, metabolic pathways and candidate genes associated with meat color traits. Additionally, we mapped 114 non-redundant DEGs to the meat color QTLs via a comparative analysis with the porcine quantitative trait loci (QTL) database. Overall, our data serve as a valuable resource for identifying genes whose functions are critical for meat color traits and can accelerate studies of the molecular mechanisms of meat color formation.

RNA-Seq examines global gene expression to provide insights into cellular processes, and it can be particularly informative when comparing contrasting physiological states or strains. Although relatively routine in many laboratories, there are many steps involved in performing a transcriptomics experiment to ensure representative and high-quality results are generated for analysis. In this chapter, we present the application of widely used bioinformatic methodologies to assess, trim, and filter RNA-seq reads for quality using FastQC and Trim Galore, respectively. High-quality reads are mapped using Bowtie2 and differentially expressed genes across different groups were estimated using the DEseq2 R-Bioconductor package. In addition, we describe the various steps to perform the sample-wise data quality assessment by generating exploratory plots through the DESeq2 package. Simple steps to calculate the significant differentially expressed genes, up- and down-regulated genes, and exporting the data and images are also included. A Venn diagram is a useful method to compare the differentially expressed genes across various comparisons and steps to generate the Venn diagram from DESeq2 results are provided. Finally, the output from DESeq2 is compared to published results from EdgeR. The Clostridium autoethanogenum data are published and publicly available.

In the past 5 years, RNA-Seq has become a powerful tool in transcriptome analysis even though computational methods dedicated to the analysis of high-throughput sequencing data are yet to be standardized. It is, however, now commonly accepted that the choice of a normalization procedure is an important step in such a process, for example in differential gene expression analysis. The present article highlights the similarities between three normalization methods: TMM from edgeR R package, RLE from DESeq2 R package, and MRN. Both TMM and DESeq2 are widely used for differential gene expression analysis. This paper introduces properties that show when these three methods will give exactly the same results. These properties are proven mathematically and illustrated by performing <i>in silico</i> calculations on a given RNA-Seq data set.

<b>Background:</b> Melanoma is highly immunogenic and therefore suitable for immunotherapy, but the efficacy is limited by response rate. In several types of tumor, tumor mutation burden (TMB) and immune infiltration have been reported to predict the response to immunotherapy, although each has its limitations. In the current study, we aimed to explore the association of TMB with immune infiltration and prognosis in cutaneous melanoma. <b>Methods:</b> The data of cutaneous melanoma used for analyses was downloaded from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) database. The mutation data was sorted using "maftools" R package. TMB was estimated and then patients were divided into two groups based on TMB. The association of TMB with prognosis and clinical characteristics was explored. Differential analysis between two TMB groups was performed using "DESeq2" R package to identify differentially expressed genes (DEGs). The function enrichment analyses of DEGs were conducted to screen critical pathways. Besides, DEGs were further filtered to identify two hub genes, based on which a risk score model and nomogram for predicting prognosis were conducted, and the validation was performed using three datasets from Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) database. Finally, CIBERSORT algorithm and TIMER database were used to assess the effect of TMB and hub genes on immune infiltration. <b>Results:</b> The most common mutation was C > T, and the top three frequently mutated genes were <i>TTN, MUC16</i>, and <i>BRAF</i>. Higher TMB indicated better survival outcomes and lower pathological stages. 735 DEGs were identified and mainly involved in immune-related and adhesion-related pathways. The risk score model and nomogram were validated using receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves and calibration curves, and exhibited relatively high predictive capability. Decision curve analysis (DCA) was used to assess clinical benefit. As for immune infiltration, the proportion was higher for macrophages M1 and M2 in the high-TMB group, while lower for memory B cells and regulatory T cells. <b>Conclusions:</b> In cutaneous melanoma, TMB was positively correlated with prognosis. The risk score model and nomogram can be conveniently used to predict prognosis. The association of TMB with immune infiltration can help improve the predicting methods for the response to immunotherapy.

In comparative high-throughput sequencing assays, a fundamental task is the analysis of count data, such as read counts per gene in RNA-seq, for evidence of systematic changes across experimental conditions. Small replicate numbers, discreteness, large dynamic range and the presence of outliers require a suitable statistical approach. We present DESeq2, a method for differential analysis of count data, using shrinkage estimation for dispersions and fold changes to improve stability and interpretability of estimates. This enables a more quantitative analysis focused on the strength rather than the mere presence of differential expression. The DESeq2 package is available at http://www.bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/html/DESeq2.html webcite.

Differential expression (DE) analysis of RNA-seq data still poses inferential challenges, such as handling of transcripts characterized by low expression levels. In this study, we use a plasmode-based approach to assess the relative performance of alternative inferential strategies on RNA-seq transcripts, with special emphasis on transcripts characterized by a small number of read counts, so-called low-count transcripts, as motivated by an ecological application in prairie grasses. Big bluestem (Andropogon gerardii) is a wide-ranging dominant prairie grass of ecological and agricultural importance to the US Midwest while edaphic subspecies sand bluestem (A. gerardii ssp. Hallii) grows exclusively on sand dunes. Relative to big bluestem, sand bluestem exhibits qualitative phenotypic divergence consistent with enhanced drought tolerance, plausibly associated with transcripts of low expression levels. Our dataset consists of RNA-seq read counts for 25,582 transcripts (60% of which are classified as low-count) collected from leaf tissue of individual plants of big bluestem (n = 4) and sand bluestem (n = 4). Focused on low-count transcripts, we compare alternative ad-hoc data filtering techniques commonly used in RNA-seq pipelines and assess the inferential performance of recently developed statistical methods for DE analysis, namely DESeq2 and edgeR robust. These methods attempt to overcome the inherently noisy behavior of low-count transcripts by either shrinkage or differential weighting of observations, respectively. Both DE methods seemed to properly control family-wise type 1 error on low-count transcripts, whereas edgeR robust showed greater power and DESeq2 showed greater precision and accuracy. However, specification of the degree of freedom parameter under edgeR robust had a non-trivial impact on inference and should be handled carefully. When properly specified, both DE methods showed overall promising inferential performance on low-count transcripts, suggesting that ad-hoc data filtering steps at arbitrary expression thresholds may be unnecessary. A note of caution is in order regarding the approximate nature of DE tests under both methods. Practical recommendations for DE inference are provided when low-count RNA-seq transcripts are of interest, as is the case in the comparison of subspecies of bluestem grasses. Insights from this study may also be relevant to other applications focused on transcripts of low expression levels.

Background. A common research goal in transcriptome projects is to find genes that are differentially expressed in different phenotype classes. Biologists might wish to validate such gene candidates experimentally, or use them for downstream systems biology analysis. Producing a coherent differential gene expression analysis from RNA-seq count data requires an understanding of how numerous sources of variation such as the replicate size, the hypothesized biological effect size, and the specific method for making differential expression calls interact. We believe an explicit demonstration of such interactions in real RNA-seq data sets is of practical interest to biologists. Results. Using two large public RNA-seq data sets-one representing strong, and another mild, biological effect size-we simulated different replicate size scenarios, and tested the performance of several commonly-used methods for calling differentially expressed genes in each of them. We found that, when biological effect size was mild, RNA-seq experiments should focus on experimental validation of differentially expressed gene candidates. Importantly, at least triplicates must be used, and the differentially expressed genes should be called using methods with high positive predictive value (PPV), such as NOISeq or GFOLD. In contrast, when biological effect size was strong, differentially expressed genes mined from unreplicated experiments using NOISeq, ASC and GFOLD had between 30 to 50% mean PPV, an increase of more than 30-fold compared to the cases of mild biological effect size. Among methods with good PPV performance, having triplicates or more substantially improved mean PPV to over 90% for GFOLD, 60% for DESeq2, 50% for NOISeq, and 30% for edgeR. At a replicate size of six, we found DESeq2 and edgeR to be reasonable methods for calling differentially expressed genes at systems level analysis, as their PPV and sensitivity trade-off were superior to the other methods'. Conclusion. When biological effect size is weak, systems level investigation is not possible using RNAseq data, and no meaningful result can be obtained in unreplicated experiments. Nonetheless, NOISeq or GFOLD may yield limited numbers of gene candidates with good validation potential, when triplicates or more are available. When biological effect size is strong, NOISeq and GFOLD are effective tools for detecting differentially expressed genes in unreplicated RNA-seq experiments for qPCR validation. When triplicates or more are available, GFOLD is a sharp tool for identifying high confidence differentially expressed genes for targeted qPCR validation; for downstream systems level analysis, combined results from DESeq2 and edgeR are useful.

Circulating miRNAs have received extensive attention as non-invasive biomarkers for prediction and diagnosis of disease. However, most samples have been obtained from peripheral venous blood. To evaluate whether peripheral venous miRNAs represent circulating miRNAs from all blood vessels under a given condition, such as aging, we compared the miRNA profiles of venous and arterial plasma between young and aged rats by Illumina next-generation sequencing. The DEseq2 tool was used to obtain differentially-expressed miRNAs. We observed 105 aging-related deregulated miRNAs in vein and 62 in artery, which were highly associated with cell survival and inflammation, respectively. On the other hand, the young and aged groups exhibited a unique arterial-venous bias. There were 54 differentially-expressed miRNAs in the young group and 42 in the aged group; only 8 miRNAs were shared. Further transcriptional factors enrichment analysis found that the shared miRNAs could be partially upregulated by NF-ÎºB and SIRT1. These transcriptional factors could be organ-specific and/or regulated in physiological and aging states as possible causal factors. This study suggested the potential application of circulating miRNAs, which reflect the systematic response to certain conditions, such as aging, and the importance of origin selection for candidate circulating miRNAs.

The current DNA sequencing technologies and their high-throughput yield, allowed the thrive of genomic and transcriptomic experiments but it also have generated big data problem. Due to this exponential growth of sequencing data, also the complexity of managing, processing and interpreting it in order to generate results, has raised. Therefore, the demand of easy-to-use friendly software and websites to run bioinformatic tools is imminent. In particular, RNA-Seq and differential expression analysis have become a popular and useful method to evaluate the genetic expression change in any organism. However, many scientists struggle with the data analysis since most of the available tools are implemented in a UNIX-based environment. Therefore, we have developed the web server IDEAMEX (Integrative Differential Expression Analysis for Multiple EXperiments). The IDEAMEX pipeline needs a raw count table for as many desired replicates and conditions, allowing the user to select which conditions will be compared, instead of doing all-vs.-all comparisons. The whole process consists of three main steps (1) Data Analysis: that allows a preliminary analysis for quality control based on the data distribution per sample, using different types of graphs; (2) Differential expression: performs the differential expression analysis with or without batch effect error awareness, using the bioconductor packages, NOISeq, limma-Voom, DESeq2 and edgeR, and generate reports for each method; (3) Result integration: the obtained results the integrated results are reported using different graphical outputs such as correlograms, heatmaps, Venn diagrams and text lists. Our server allows an easy and friendly visualization for results, providing an easy interaction during the analysis process, as well as error tracking and debugging by providing output log files. The server is currently available and can be accessed at http://www.uusmb.unam.mx/ideamex/ where the documentation and example input files are provided. We consider that this web server can help other researchers with no previous bioinformatic knowledge, to perform their analyses in a simple manner.
