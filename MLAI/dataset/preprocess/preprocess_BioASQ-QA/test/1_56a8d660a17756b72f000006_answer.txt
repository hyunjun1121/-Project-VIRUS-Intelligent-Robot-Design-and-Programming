IDEAL_ANSWER:
- 0.5% of the non-ionic detergent Nonidet-40 (NP-40) during cell lysis and nuclei isolation is sufficient to practically eliminate contamination by endogenous biotinylated carboxylases during purification of biotin tagged nuclear proteins.
- NP-40 reduces contamination by endogenous biotinylated carboxylases during purification of biotin tagged nuclear proteins.

EXACT_ANSWER:
- Reduction of contamination by endogenous biotinylated carboxylases during purification of biotin tagged nuclear proteins.
