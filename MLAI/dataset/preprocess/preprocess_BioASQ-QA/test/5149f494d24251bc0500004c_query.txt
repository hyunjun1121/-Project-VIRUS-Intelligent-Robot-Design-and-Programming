To determine whether naloxone administered i.v. to out-of-hospital patients with suspected opioid overdose would have a more rapid therapeutic onset than naloxone given subcutaneously (s.q.). A prospective, sequential, observational cohort study of 196 consecutive patients with suspected opioid overdose was conducted in an urban out-of-hospital setting, comparing time intervals from arrival at the patient's side to development of a respiratory rate > or =10 breaths/min, and durations of bag-valve-mask ventilation. Subjects received either naloxone 0.4 mg i.v. (n = 74) or naloxone 0.8 mg s.q. (n = 122), for respiratory depression of <10 breaths/min. Mean interval from crew arrival to respiratory rate > or =10 breaths/min was 9.3 +/- 4.2 min for the i.v. group vs 9.6 +/- 4.58 min for the s.q. group (95% CI of the difference -1.55, 1.00). Mean duration of bag-valve-mask ventilation was 8.1 +/- 6.0 min for the i.v. group vs 9.1 +/- 4.8 min for the s.q. group. Cost of materials for administering naloxone 0.4 mg i.v. was $12.30/patient, compared with $10.70/patient for naloxone 0.8 mg s.q. There was no clinical difference in the time interval to respiratory rate > or =10 breaths/min between naloxone 0.8 mg s.q. and naloxone 0.4 mg i.v. for the out-of-hospital management of patients with suspected opioid overdose. The slower rate of absorption via the s.q. route was offset by the delay in establishing an i.v.

Opioid overdose is rarely the primary cause of altered mental status in cancer patients receiving opioid therapy. The inappropriate administration of naloxone to reverse an abnormal mental status can cause severe withdrawal symptoms and pain. To illustrate this problem, we report the case of a patient inappropriately treated with naloxone and the results of a retrospective review of the medical records of 15 consecutive patients with cancer treated with naloxone in the emergency department over a 5-month period. We offer guidelines for a more thoughtful approach to the management of patients with cancer who present with encephalopathy.

Heroin overdose is a major cause of death among heroin users, and often occurs in the company of other users. However, sudden death after injection is rare, giving ample opportunity for intervention. Naloxone hydrochloride, an injectable opioid antagonist which reverses the respiratory depression, sedation and hypotension associated with opioids, has long been used to treat opioid overdose. Experts have suggested that, as part of a comprehensive overdose prevention strategy, naloxone should be provided to heroin users for peer administration after an overdose. A trial could be conducted to determine whether this intervention improves the management of overdose or results in a net increase in harm (by undermining existing prevention strategies, precipitating naloxone-related complications, or resulting in riskier heroin use).

To develop a clinical prediction rule to identify patients who can be safely discharged one hour after the administration of naloxone for presumed opioid overdose. Patients who received naloxone for known or presumed opioid overdose were formally evaluated one hour later for multiple potential predictor variables. Patients were classified into two groups: those with adverse events within 24 hours and those without. Using classification and regression tree methodology, a decision rule was developed to predict safe discharge. Clinical findings from 573 patients allowed us to develop a clinical prediction rule with a sensitivity of 99% (95% CI = 96% to 100%) and a specificity of 40% (95% CI = 36% to 45%). Patients with presumed opioid overdose can be safely discharged one hour after naloxone administration if they: 1) can mobilize as usual; 2) have oxygen saturation on room air of >92%; 3) have a respiratory rate >10 breaths/min and <20 breaths/min; 4) have a temperature of >35.0 degrees C and <37.5 degrees C; 5) have a heart rate >50 beats/min and <100 beats/min; and 6) have a Glasgow Coma Scale score of 15. This prediction rule for safe early discharge of patients with presumed opioid overdose performs well in this derivation set but requires validation followed by confirmation of safe implementation.

Drug and alcohol abuse continue to be commonly encountered problems in most patient populations. To deal effectively with these problems, the primary care physician must have a thorough knowledge of the pharmacology of commonly abused drugs and the adjunctive agents used in treatment. Management of alcoholism may involve a range of medical interventions, including the treatment of alcohol intoxication, the use of benzodiazepines for alcohol withdrawal, and possibly the short-term administration of disulfiram to maintain sobriety. Successful management of cocaine or amphetamine abuse requires an understanding of the powerful reinforcing properties of these drugs and the unique problems that arise in the recovery period. Barbiturate intoxication and withdrawal are potentially life-threatening events requiring skilled in-patient treatment. Prolonged use of benzodiazepines can lead to drug dependence; successful withdrawal involves gradual dosage reduction. Acute intoxication from marijuana or hallucinogenic drugs may occasionally result in adverse reactions requiring medical intervention, but significant withdrawal reactions are rare. Management of opioid overdose, whether illicit or iatrogenic, requires the prompt and skillful use of opioid overdose, whether illicit or iatrogenic, requires the prompt and skillful use of opioid antagonists. Promising new pharmacologic approaches are now being successfully applied to the management of opioid dependence. An acceptance of nicotine as the addictive component of tobacco smoke has led to the development of nicotine gum as substitution therapy for cigarette smoking. Successful pharmacologic management of overdose or withdrawal is often the prerequisite for effective long-term treatment and recovery.

Opioid overdose has a high mortality, but is often reversible with appropriate overdose management and naloxone (opioid antagonist). Training in these skills has been successfully trialled internationally with opioid users themselves. Healthcare professionals working in substance misuse are in a prime position to deliver overdose prevention training to drug users and may themselves witness opioid overdoses. The best method of training dissemination has not been identified. The study assessed post-training change in clinician knowledge for managing an opioid overdose and administering naloxone, evaluated the 'cascade method' for disseminating training, and identified barriers to implementation. A repeated-measures design evaluated knowledge pre-and-post training. A sub-set of clinicians were interviewed to identify barriers to implementation. Clinicians from addiction services across England received training. Participants self-completed a structured questionnaire recording overdose knowledge, confidence and barriers to implementation. One hundred clinicians were trained initially, who trained a further 119 clinicians (n=219) and thereafter trained 239 drug users. The mean composite score for opioid overdose risk signs and actions to be taken was 18.3/26 (±3.8) which increased to 21.2/26 (±4.1) after training, demonstrating a significant improvement in knowledge (Z=9.2, p<0.001). The proportion of clinicians willing to use naloxone in an opioid overdose rose from 77% to 99% after training. Barriers to implementing training were clinician time and confidence, service resources, client willingness and naloxone formulation. Training clinicians how to manage an opioid overdose and administer naloxone was effective. However the 'cascade method' was only modestly successful for disseminating training to a large clinician workforce, with a range of clinician and service perceived obstacles. Drug policy changes and improvements to educational programmes for drug services would be important to ensure successful implementation of overdose training internationally.

The objective of this guideline is to assist poison center personnel in the appropriate out-of-hospital triage and initial out-of-hospital management of patients with a suspected ingestion of dextromethorphan by 1) describing the process by which an ingestion of dextromethorphan might be managed, 2) identifying the key decision elements in managing cases of dextromethorphan ingestion, 3) providing clear and practical recommendations that reflect the current state of knowledge, and 4) identifying needs for research. This guideline applies to the ingestion of dextromethorphan alone. Co-ingestion of additional substances could require different referral and management recommendations depending on the combined toxicities of the substances. This guideline is based on an assessment of current scientific and clinical information. The expert consensus panel recognizes that specific patient care decisions might be at variance with this guideline and are the prerogative of the patient and the health professionals providing care, considering all of the circumstances involved. This guideline does not substitute for clinical judgment. The grade of recommendation is in parentheses. 1) All patients with suicidal intent, intentional abuse, or in cases in which a malicious intent is suspected (e.g., child abuse or neglect) should be referred to an emergency department (Grade D). 2) Patients who exhibit more than mild effects (e.g., infrequent vomiting or somnolence [lightly sedated and arousable with speaking voice or light touch]) after an acute dextromethorphan ingestion should be referred to an emergency department (Grade C). 3) Patients who have ingested 5-7.5 mg/kg should receive poison center-initiated follow-up approximately every 2 hours for up to 4 hours after ingestion. Refer to an emergency department if more than mild symptoms develop (Grade D). 4) Patients who have ingested more than 7.5 mg/kg should be referred to an emergency department for evaluation (Grade C). 5) If the patient is taking other medications likely to interact with dextromethorphan and cause serotonin syndrome, such as monoamine oxidase inhibitors or selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors, poison center-initiated follow-up every 2 hours for 8 hours is recommended (Grade D). 6) Patients who are asymptomatic and more than 4 hours have elapsed since the time of ingestion can be observed at home (Grade C). 7) Do not induce emesis (Grade D). 8) Do not use activated charcoal at home. Activated charcoal can be administered to asymptomatic patients who have ingested overdoses of dextromethorphan within the preceding hour. Its administration, if available, should only be carried out by health professionals and only if no contraindications are present. Do not delay transportation in order to administer activated charcoal (Grade D). 9) For patients who have ingested dextromethorphan and are sedated or comatose, naloxone, in the usual doses for treatment of opioid overdose, can be considered for prehospital administration, particularly if the patient has respiratory depression (Grade C). 10) Use intravenous benzodiazepines for seizures and benzodiazepines and external cooling measures for hyperthermia (>104 degrees F, >40 degrees C) for serotonin syndrome. This should be done in consultation with and authorized by EMS medical direction, by a written treatment protocol or policy, or with direct medical oversight (Grade C). 11) Carefully ascertain by history whether other drugs, such as acetaminophen, were involved in the incident and assess the risk for toxicity or for a drug interaction.
