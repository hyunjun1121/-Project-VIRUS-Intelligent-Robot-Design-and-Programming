Which is the most prevalent form of arrhythmia worldwide?

[PMID: 23795692]
Atrial fibrillation (AF) is the most prevalent sustained cardiac arrhythmia in clinical practice associated with significant morbidity and mortality. With the growing number of the affected individuals, the development of safe and effective treatment options for AF has become a worldwide priority. Currently available antiarrhythmic medications for the restoration and maintenance of sinus rhythm have limitations due to the modest efficacy and a potential for adverseeffects. Although substantial progress has been made in AF-ablation techniques, broad application of these nonpharmacological treatment modalities is limited and antiarrhythmic drug treatment is still the cornerstone and the first-line therapy for the majority of AF patients. Improvements in the understanding of the principal pathophysiological mechanisms of AF obtained in the last several years have provided promising treatment opportunities. New therapeutic options are based on the more selective targeting of ion channels and intercellular connection proteins predominantly expressed in the atria, the restoration of intracellular Ca(2+) homeostasis and the prevention of AF-associated electrical and structural remodeling. In this review, we provide a highlight of the most important pathophysiological mechanisms in AF with a relation to the potential therapeutic interventions, and discuss novel findings regarding the current and future pharmacological AF management and recent patents.

Atrial fibrillation remains the most prevalent cardiac arrhythmia, and its incidence is increasing as the population ages. Common conditions associated with an increased incidence include advanced age, hypertension, heart failure, and valvular heart disease. Patients with atrial fibrillation may complain of palpitations, fatigue, and decreased exercise tolerance or may be completely asymptomatic. Options for treating patients who experience atrial fibrillation include rate-controlling drugs such as digoxin, β-blockers, and calcium channel blockers or a rhythm-controlling strategy with agents such as sodium channel blockers and potassium channel blockers. Atrial fibrillation increases the risk of stroke due to atrial thrombus formation and embolization. Anticoagulation with the vitamin K antagonist, warfarin, remains the most widely prescribed treatment option to decrease stroke risk. Several other antithrombotic agents have recently become available and offer excellent alternatives to warfarin. Catheter ablation can be undertaken as a nonpharmacologic rhythm control option with varying degrees of success depending on duration of atrial fibrillation and follow-up time from the procedure. This review article further describes the management options for patients presenting with atrial fibrillation.

Atrial fibrillation (AF) is the most prevalent cardiac arrhythmia and has a significant impact on morbidity and mortality. Current antiarrhythmic drugs for AF suffer from limited safety and efficacy, probably because they were not designed based on specific pathological mechanisms. Recent research has provided important insights into the mechanisms contributing to AF and highlighted several potential novel antiarrhythmic strategies. In this review, we highlight the main pathological mechanisms of AF, discuss traditional and novel aspects of atrial antiarrhythmic drugs in relation to these pathological mechanisms, and present potential novel therapeutic approaches including structure-based modulation of atrial-specific cardiac ion channels, restoring abnormal Ca(2+) handling in AF and targeting atrial remodeling.

Atrial fibrillation (AF) is the most common arrhythmia worldwide, and it has a significant effect on morbidity and mortality. It is a significant risk factor for stroke and peripheral embolization, and it has an effect on cardiac function. Despite widespread interest and extensive research on this topic, our understanding of the etiology and pathogenesis of this disease process is still incomplete. As a result, there are no set primary preventive strategies in place apart from general cardiology risk factor prevention goals. It seems intuitive that a better understanding of the risk factors for AF would better prepare medical professionals to initially prevent or subsequently treat these patients. In this article, we discuss widely established risk factors for AF and explore newer risk factors currently being investigated that may have implications in the primary prevention of AF. For this review, we conducted a search of PubMed and used the following search terms (or a combination of terms): atrial fibrillation, metabolic syndrome, obesity, dyslipidemia, hypertension, type 2 diabetes mellitus, omega-3 fatty acids, vitamin D, exercise toxicity, alcohol abuse, and treatment. We also used additional articles that were identified from the bibliographies of the retrieved articles to examine the published evidence for the risk factors of AF.

Atrial fibrillation is the most common arrhythmia affecting patients today. Disease prevalence is increasing at an alarming rate worldwide, and is associated with often catastrophic and costly consequences, including heart failure, syncope, dementia, and stroke. Therapies including anticoagulants, anti-arrhythmic medications, devices, and non-pharmacologic procedures in the last 30 years have improved patients' functionality with the disease. Nonetheless, it remains imperative that further research into AF epidemiology, genetics, detection, and treatments continues to push forward rapidly as the worldwide population ages dramatically over the next 20 years.

Atrial fibrillation is the most common heart rhythm disorder in the world, with major public health impact especially due to increased risk of stroke and hospitalizations. The recently published results on epidemiology of atrial fibrillation from the Global Burden of Diseases, Injuries, and Risk Factors Study confirm the existence of a significant and progressive worldwide increase in the burden of atrial fibrillation. However, there appears to be regional variation in both the burden of atrial fibrillation and availability of epidemiological data regarding this condition. In this review, the authors identify issues that are unique to the developed versus developing regions and outline a road map for possible approaches to surveillance, management, and prevention of atrial fibrillation at the global level.

Atrial fibrillation is the most prevalent form of cardiac arrhythmia. Current treatments extend the atrial effective refractory period by nonselective blockade of cardiac ion channels. An alternative approach selectively targeting the Kv1.5 ion channel offers the opportunity for therapeutic benefit with decreased risk of adverse cardiovascular events. KVI-020 (4g) successfully demonstrated antiarrhythmic efficacy in a canine arrhythmia model, and these findings support its utility as an antiarrhythmic agent.

Cardiac arrhythmias continue to pose a major medical challenge and significant public health burden. Atrial fibrillation, the most prevalent arrhythmia, affects more than two million Americans annually and is associated with a twofold increase in mortality. In addition, more than 250,000 Americans each year suffer ventricular arrhythmias, often resulting in sudden cardiac death. Despite the high incidence and societal impact of cardiac arrhythmias, presently there are insufficient insights into the molecular mechanisms involved in arrhythmia generation, propagation, and/or maintenance or into the molecular determinants of disease risk, prognosis, and progression. In addition, present therapeutic strategies for arrhythmia abatement often are ineffective or require palliative device therapy after persistent changes in the electrical and conduction characteristics of the heart have occurred, changes that appear to increase the risk for arrhythmia progression. This article reviews our present understanding of the complexity of mechanisms that regulate cardiac membrane excitability and cardiac function and explores the role of derangements in these mechanisms that interact to induce arrhythmogenic substrates. Approaches are recommended for future investigations focused on providing new mechanistic insights and therapeutic interventions.

Atrial fibrillation is the most prevalent sustained arrhythmia. This paper estimates the burden and cost of illness attributable to atrial fibrillation in Portugal based on demographic and health statistics. Mortality data by cause of death came from the European Detailed Mortality Database of the World Health Organization (WHO). Hospital data were taken from the Portuguese diagnosis-related groups database. The burden of disease was measured using DALYs (disability-adjusted life years), a metric adopted by the WHO. Costs studied included resource use and lost productivity. The burden and cost of illness are those attributable to atrial fibrillation and its main complication, ischemic stroke. In Portugal, 4070 deaths were attributable to atrial fibrillation in 2010, corresponding to 3.8% of all deaths. In total, the burden of disease attributable to atrial fibrillation was estimated at 23,084 DALYs: 10,521 resulting from premature deaths (1.7% of the total DALYs due to death in 2010 in Portugal), and 12,563 resulting from disability. The total estimated direct costs attributable to atrial fibrillation at 2013 prices were €115 million: €34 million for inpatient care and €81 million for outpatient care. Indirect costs resulting from lost production due to disability were estimated at €25 million. Atrial fibrillation has an important social impact in Portugal due to its associated mortality and morbidity, and was responsible in 2013 for a total cost of €140 million, about 0.08% of gross domestic product.

Atrial fibrillation (AF) is associated with increased morbidity and is in addition the most prevalent cardiac arrhythmia. Compounds used in pharmacological treatment has traditionally been divided into Na(+) channel inhibitors, β-blockers, K(+) channel inhibitors, and Ca(2+) channel inhibitors, whereas newer multichannel blockers such as amiodarone and ranolazine have been introduced later. This study was devoted to the evaluation of an acute pacing-induced in vivo model of AF in rats. Antiarrhythmic effects of well-known compounds such as lidocaine, dofetilide, and ranolazine were confirmed in this model. In addition, antiarrhythmic effects of different inhibitors of Ca(2+)-activated small conductance K(+) (SK) channels were demonstrated. Intravenous application of 5 mg/kg of the negative SK channel modulator NS8593 reduced AF duration by 64.5%, and the lowest significantly effective dose was 1.5 mg/kg. A dose-effect relationship was established based on 6 different dose groups. Furthermore, it was demonstrated that the antiarrhythmic effect of NS8593 and other tested drugs was associated with an increase in atrial effective refractory period. The functional role of SK channels was confirmed by 2 other SK channel inhibitors, UCL1684 and apamin, thereby confirming the hypothesis that these channels might constitute a new promising target for antiarrhythmic treatment.

Atrial fibrillation (AF) is the most common cardiac arrhythmia affecting up to 1-1.5% of the population. Regular physical activity reduces the risk of cardiovascular diseases, however several studies have shown paradoxically increased incidence of AF in people practicing sport, especially in elite athletes. The results of studies suggest a U-shape relationship between sport and risk of arrhythmia. Minor regular exertion protects from arrhythmia through reduction in AF risk factors, while intense physical activity increases the risk of arrhythmia. The etiopathogenesis of arrhythmia in athletes has not been fully elucidated yet, but it is definitely multifactorial. Arrhythmia's occurrence may be related to adaptative remodeling of a heart, autonomic nervous system alteration as well as may be associated with other factors like inflammation or dyselectrolitaemia. Atrial Fibrillation in athletes should always be considered as an abnormality which requires further investigation as in small percentage of cases arrhythmia may be the first manifestation of a structural heart disease or chanellopathy potentially leading to sudden cardiac death. Taking into account several problems related to pharmacotherapy, AF ablation has become the first line treatment in athletes.
