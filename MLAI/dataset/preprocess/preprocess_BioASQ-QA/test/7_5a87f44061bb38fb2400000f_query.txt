Crizotinib was approved to treat anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK)- positive non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) by the Food and Drug Administration in 2011.We conducted a systematic review of clinical trials and retrospective studies to compare the efficacy and safety of crizotinib with chemotherapy. We searched electronic databases from inception to Dec. 2016. Clinical trials and retrospective studies regarding crizotinib and crizotinib versus chemotherapy in treatment of NSCLC were eligible. The primary outcomes were the objective response rate (ORR) and disease control rate (DCR). Nine studies (five clinical trials and four retrospective studies) including 729 patients met the inclusion criteria. Crizotinib treatment revealed 1-year OS of 77.1% and PFS of 9.17 months. And crizotinib had a better performance than chemotherapy in ORR (OR: 4.97, 95%CI: 3.16 to 7.83, P<0.00001, I2=35%). DCR revealed superiority with crizotinib than chemotherapy (OR: 3.42, 95% CI: 2.33 to 5.01, P<0.00001, I2=0%). PR (partial response) were significant superior to that of chemotherapy through direct systematic review. No statistically significant difference in CR (complete response) was found between crizotinib-treated group and chemotherapy-treated group. Regarding SD (stable disease), chemotherapy-treated group had a better performance than crizotinib-treated group. Common adverse events associated with crizotinib were visual disorder, gastrointestinal side effects, and elevated liver aminotransferase levels, whereas common adverse events with chemotherapy were fatigue, nausea, and hematologic toxicity. This systematic review revealed improved objective response rate and increased disease control rate in crizotinib group comparing with chemotherapy group. Crizotinib treatment would be a favorable treatment option for patients with ALK-positive NSCLC. ALK inhibitors may have future potential applications in other cancers driven by ALK or c-MET gene mutations.

Activation of the EGFR pathway is one of the mechanisms inducing acquired resistance to anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK) tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKI) such as crizotinib and alectinib. Ceritinib is a highly selective ALK inhibitor and shows promising efficacy in non-small cell lung cancers (NSCLC) harboring the ALK gene rearrangement. However, the precise mechanism underlying acquired resistance to ceritinib is not well-defined. This study set out to clarify the mechanism in ALK-translocated lung cancer and to find the preclinical rationale overcoming EGFR pathway-induced acquired resistance to ALK-TKIs. To this end, ceritinib-resistant cells (H3122-CER) were established from the H3122 NSCLC cell line harboring the ALK gene rearrangement via long-term exposure to ceritinib. H3122-CER cells acquired resistance to ceritinib through EGFR bypass pathway activation. Furthermore, H3122 cells that became resistant to ceritinib or alectinib through EGFR pathway activation showed cross-resistance to other ALK-TKIs. Ceritinib and afatinib combination treatment partially restored the sensitivity to ceritinib. This study proposes a preclinical rationale to use ALK-TKIs and afatinib combination therapy for ALK-translocated lung cancers that have acquired resistance to ALK-TKIs through EGFR pathway activation.

In 2007, the rearrangement of anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK) was identified to be associated with the pathogenesis of a subset of patients with non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC). Surprisingly, approximately 4 years after the discovery of ALK rearrangement in lung cancer, the first-in-class ALK inhibitor (ALKi), crizotinib, was approved for metastatic ALK-rearranged NSCLC by the US Food and Drug Administration. Subsequently, next-generation ALKis, such as alectinib and ceritinib, have been developed, and some of them have been applied in the clinical setting. Furthermore, various resistance mechanisms against ALKis have been gradually elucidated, and treatment strategies according to such resistance have been proposed. In addition, novel ALKis exhibit good antitumor efficacy for brain metastases. Thus, we now know much about ALK-rearranged NSCLC; however, is it enough? Several concerns, such as the optimal sequence of ALKis, significance of antiangiogenic therapy, immune checkpoint therapy, and cytotoxic chemotherapy in ALK-rearranged NSCLC, should be clearly addressed, which would lead to the establishment of optimal treatment strategies and a more prolonged survival in patients with ALK rearrangement. Thus, we should w'ALK' into the next stage.

Anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK) rearrangement is detected in 3-7% of patients with non-small-cell lung cancer. Crizotinib is an ALK inhibitor, which was approved in 2011 for the treatment of ALK-positive lung cancer. Despite the initial enthusiasm, most of the patients develop resistance within the first year of treatment. The main mechanisms are secondary mutations and bypass track activation. Moreover, crizotinib has low penetration into the central nervous system. The need to overcome these limitations has led to the development of second-generation inhibitors that have better effectiveness against crizotinib-resistant mutations and brain metastases. Ceritinib and alectinib are the only approved drugs of this group. Many ongoing trials try to define the most appropriate agent for the treatment of ALK-positive lung cancer depending on the responsible mechanism. This review focuses on the current data regarding the potential mechanisms of resistance to ALK inhibitors and the strategies to overcome it.

Alectinib, an anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK) inhibitor, is approved for treatment of patients with ALK+ non-small cell lung cancer who have progressed, on or are intolerant to, crizotinib. This study assessed the effect of a high-fat meal and the proton pump inhibitor, esomeprazole, on the pharmacokinetics (PK) of alectinib. This was an open-label, 2-group study in healthy subjects. In group 1 (n = 18), subjects were randomly assigned to a 2-treatment (A, fasted conditions; B, following a high-fat meal), 2-sequence (AB or BA) crossover assessment, separated by a 10-day washout. In group 2 (n = 24), subjects were enrolled in a 2-period, fixed-sequence crossover assessment to evaluate the effect of esomeprazole. PK parameters were evaluated for alectinib, its major similarly active metabolite, M4, and the combined exposure of alectinib and M4. Administration of alectinib following a high-fat meal substantially increased the combined exposure of alectinib and M4 to 331% (90%CI, 279%-393%) and 311% (90%CI, 273%-355%) for C<sub>max</sub> and AUC<sub>0-∞</sub> , respectively, versus fasted conditions. Coadministration of esomeprazole had no clinically relevant effect on the combined exposure of alectinib and M4. Alectinib should be administered under fed conditions to maximize its bioavailability, whereas no restrictions are required with antisecretory agents.

Alectinib and crizotinib have been approved for the therapy of NSCLC caused by anaplastic lymphoma kinase gene (ALK) rearrangement. The effect of alectinib or crizotinib on overall survival (OS) in patients with ALK-rearranged NSCLC remains unknown. A multicenter retrospective study was conducted to compare OS between patients receiving alectinib and crizotinib and between patients treated with alectinib and those treated sequentially with crizotinib and then alectinib after crizotinib failure. The time to treatment failure (TTF), progression-free survival (PFS), and OS were compared. Sixty-one patients with ALK-rearranged NSCLC were enrolled. Forty-six patients were treated with anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK) inhibitors (31 with crizotinib, 28 with alectinib, and 13 with both ALK inhibitors). The response rate was 66.7% for the crizotinib-treated group and 80.8% for the alectinib-treated group. Among all patients, TTF and PFS were significantly prolonged in the alectinib-treated group compared with in the crizotinib-treated group. Subgroup analyses revealed significantly prolonged TTF for alectinib compared with crizotinib therapy in the ALK inhibitor-naive population. OS was significantly longer in the alectinib-treated group than in the crizotinib-treated group. The TTF and OS of patients treated sequentially with crizotinib and then with alectinib after crizotinib failure tended to be longer than those of patients treated with alectinib alone. Therapy with alectinib alone was significantly superior to therapy with crizotinib alone in terms of TTF, PFS, and OS, and sequential therapy with crizotinib and alectinib after crizotinib failure tended to provide a better OS benefit than did therapy with alectinib alone in patients with ALK-positive NSCLC. However, large-scale prospective studies are needed to confirm these observations.

The anaplastic lymphoma kinase (<i>ALK</i>) gene plays an important physiologic role in the development of the brain and can be oncogenically altered in several malignancies, including non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) and anaplastic large cell lymphomas (ALCL). Most prevalent <i>ALK</i> alterations are chromosomal rearrangements resulting in fusion genes, as seen in ALCL and NSCLC. In other tumors, <i>ALK</i> copy-number gains and activating <i>ALK</i> mutations have been described. Dramatic and often prolonged responses are seen in patients with <i>ALK</i> alterations when treated with ALK inhibitors. Three of these-crizotinib, ceritinib, and alectinib-are now FDA approved for the treatment of metastatic NSCLC positive for <i>ALK</i> fusions. However, the emergence of resistance is universal. Newer ALK inhibitors and other targeting strategies are being developed to counteract the newly emergent mechanism(s) of ALK inhibitor resistance. This review outlines the recent developments in our understanding and treatment of tumors with <i>ALK</i> alterations.
