Is fingolimod a drug or a pro-drug?

[PMID: 15265669]
FTY720 is a prodrug for FTY-phosphate, an agonist at four of the five known receptors for sphingosine-1-phosphate (S1P). We show that administration of either FTY720 or FTY-P to SJL mice with established relapsing-remitting experimental autoimmune encephalitis (EAE) results in a rapid and sustained improvement in their clinical status, and a reversal of changes in expression of mRNAs encoding some myelin proteins and inflammatory mediators. EAE produced by adoptively transferring lymph node cells from immunized mice to na√Øve hosts is similarly ameliorated by FTY-P. Treatment with FTY-P is accompanied by a dose-responsive peripheral lymphopoenia.
