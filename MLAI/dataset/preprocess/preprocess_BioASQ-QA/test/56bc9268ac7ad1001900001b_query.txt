What molecule is targeted by brodalumab?

[PMID: 25093016]
Advances in knowledge regarding the pathogenesis of psoriasis have allowed the development of a new class of agents known as biologic drugs. Data confirm that T helper (Th)17 and interleukin (IL)-17 signaling has a crucial role in the pathogenesis of the disease. High levels of IL-17 and Th17-related cytokines have been reported in psoriasis, leading to the suggestion of agents targeting IL-17 as a potential therapeutic strategy in psoriasis. Brodalumab is a human monoclonal antibody that targets IL-17 receptor A, blocking the effects of IL-17A, IL-17F, and IL-17E. Data from Phase I and Phase II clinical trials indicate that brodalumab has a favorable safety and tolerability profile, with strong clinical activity, suggesting that it is a potential tool for use in the treatment of moderate-to-severe psoriasis.

Early clinical studies suggested that the anti-interleukin-17 receptor A monoclonal antibody brodalumab has efficacy in the treatment of psoriasis. In two phase 3 studies (AMAGINE-2 and AMAGINE-3), patients with moderate-to-severe psoriasis were randomly assigned to receive brodalumab (210 mg or 140 mg every 2 weeks), ustekinumab (45 mg for patients with a body weight ≤100 kg and 90 mg for patients >100 kg), or placebo. At week 12, patients receiving brodalumab were randomly assigned again to receive a brodalumab maintenance dose of 210 mg every 2 weeks or 140 mg every 2 weeks, every 4 weeks, or every 8 weeks; patients receiving ustekinumab continued to receive ustekinumab every 12 weeks, and patients receiving placebo received 210 mg of brodalumab every 2 weeks. The primary aims were to evaluate the superiority of brodalumab over placebo at week 12 with respect to at least a 75% reduction in the psoriasis area-and-severity index score (PASI 75) and a static physician's global assessment (sPGA) score of 0 or 1 (clear or almost clear skin), as well as the superiority of brodalumab over ustekinumab at week 12 with respect to a 100% reduction in PASI score (PASI 100). At week 12, the PASI 75 response rates were higher with brodalumab at the 210-mg and 140-mg doses than with placebo (86% and 67%, respectively, vs. 8% [AMAGINE-2] and 85% and 69%, respectively, vs. 6% [AMAGINE-3]; P<0.001); the rates of sPGA scores of 0 or 1 were also higher with brodalumab (P<0.001). The week 12 PASI 100 response rates were significantly higher with 210 mg of brodalumab than with ustekinumab (44% vs. 22% [AMAGINE-2] and 37% vs. 19% [AMAGINE-3], P<0.001). The PASI 100 response rates with 140 mg of brodalumab were 26% in AMAGINE-2 (P=0.08 for the comparison with ustekinumab) and 27% in AMAGINE-3 (P=0.007). Rates of neutropenia were higher with brodalumab and with ustekinumab than with placebo. Mild or moderate candida infections were more frequent with brodalumab than with ustekinumab or placebo. Through week 52, the rates of serious infectious episodes were 1.0 (AMAGINE-2) and 1.3 (AMAGINE-3) per 100 patient-years of exposure to brodalumab. Brodalumab treatment resulted in significant clinical improvements in patients with moderate-to-severe psoriasis.

The IL-17 pathway is an established driver of psoriasis pathogenesis. We examined the detailed molecular and cellular effects of blockade of IL-17 signaling in human psoriatic skin before and following treatment with brodalumab, a competitive inhibitor of the IL-17 Receptor A subunit. Thousands of aberrantly expressed genes in lesional skin normalized within 2 weeks following brodalumab treatment, with conversion of the lesional psoriasis transcriptome to resemble that seen in nonlesional skin. Keratinocyte-expressed genes appeared to normalize rapidly, whereas T cell-specific normalization occurred over six weeks. The three IL-17 ligand genes that are upregulated in lesional skin, IL17A, IL17C, and IL17F, were all downregulated in a dose-dependent manner following brodalumab treatment. Cellular measures also showed a similar pattern with dramatic decreases in keratinocyte hyperplasia within one week, and decreases in infiltrating leukocytes occurred over a longer timescale. Individuals with the highest brodalumab exposure showed normalization of both IL-17-responsive genes and the psoriasis transcriptome, whereas subjects with lower exposures showed transient or incomplete molecular responses. Clinical and molecular response appeared dependent on the extent of brodalumab exposure relative to the expression of IL-17 ligand genes, and reduction of IL-17 signaling into the nonlesional range was strongly correlated with normalization of the psoriasis transcriptome. These data indicate that blockade of IL-17 signaling in psoriatic skin leads to rapid transcriptomal changes initially in keratinocyte-expressed genes, followed by normalization in the leukocyte abnormalities, and demonstrates the essential role of the IL-17R on keratinocytes in driving disease pathogenesis.

IL-17 signaling has been implicated in development and persistence of asthma. Cytokine-targeted strategies blocking IL-17 receptor signaling may be beneficial in asthma treatment. To determine efficacy and safety of brodalumab, a human anti-IL-17 receptor A monoclonal antibody, in subjects with inadequately controlled moderate to severe asthma taking regular inhaled corticosteroids. Three hundred two subjects were randomized to brodalumab (140, 210, or 280 mg) or placebo. Primary endpoint was change in Asthma Control Questionnaire (ACQ) score from baseline to Week 12. Secondary endpoints included FEV1, symptom scores, and symptom-free days. Prespecified subgroup analyses were conducted to identify potential responsive subpopulations. Analyses included randomized subjects receiving one or more doses of investigational product using last-observation-carried-forward imputation. Demographics and baseline characteristics were generally balanced among groups (n = 302; n = 226 brodalumab). For the overall study population, no treatment differences were observed. Nine prespecified subgroups were examined without corrections for multiple testing. In only the high-reversibility subgroup (post-bronchodilator FEV1 improvement ≥ 20%; n = 112) was an ACQ change with nominal significance noted; ACQ responses were nominally significant in the 210-mg group (estimated treatment difference, 0.53) but not significant in the higher 280-mg group (estimated treatment difference, 0.38). Adverse events, generally balanced among groups, were most commonly asthma, upper respiratory tract infection, and injection site reaction. Inhibition of IL-17 receptor A did not produce a treatment effect in subjects with asthma. The results of the high-reversibility subgroup analysis are of uncertain significance, requiring further study of brodalumab in this asthma subpopulation. Clinical trial registered with www.clinicaltrials.gov (NCT01199289).

Abstract Background: Studies investigating the molecular basis of psoriasis have established the central roles of TNFα, interleukin (IL)-12, IL-22 and IL-23 and there is increasing evidence that IL-17 plays a critical role in the complex pathophysiology. Preclinical studies suggest that IL-17 is a desirable therapeutic target for psoriasis treatment. We reviewed the results of the phase II clinical trials for the anti-IL-17 agents secukinumab, ixekizumab and brodalumab in order to assess the efficacy and safety profile of each agent. By week 12, the proportion of patients reaching Psoriasis Area and Severity Index (PASI 75) was comparable among the most efficacious dosage between the different agents (secukinumab 82%, ixekizumab 83% and brodalumab 82%; p<0.001 compared to placebo for all agents). The safety profiles of the agents were similar with the most frequently reported adverse events of nasopharyngitis, upper respiratory infections and injection site reaction. A small percentage of patients experienced low-grade neutropenia that was predominantly transient and asymptomatic. The anti-IL-17 agents demonstrated a rapid and robust clinical improvement accompanied by a favorable short-term safety profile. The results of the phase II trials support the theory that the IL-17 pathway is an essential target in psoriasis treatment.

We assessed the efficacy and safety of brodalumab, a human monoclonal antibody against interleukin-17 receptor A (IL17RA), in a phase 2, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study involving patients with psoriatic arthritis. We randomly assigned patients with active psoriatic arthritis to receive brodalumab (140 or 280 mg subcutaneously) or placebo on day 1 and at weeks 1, 2, 4, 6, 8, and 10. At week 12, patients who had not discontinued their participation in the study were offered open-label brodalumab (280 mg) every 2 weeks. The primary end point was 20% improvement in American College of Rheumatology response criteria (ACR 20) at week 12. Of the 168 patients who underwent randomization (57 in the brodalumab 140-mg group, 56 in the brodalumab 280-mg group, and 55 in the placebo group), 159 completed the double-blind phase and 134 completed 40 weeks of the open-label extension. At week 12, the brodalumab 140-mg and 280-mg groups had higher rates of ACR 20 than the placebo group (37% [P=0.03] and 39% [P=0.02], respectively, vs. 18%); they also had higher rates of 50% improvement (ACR 50) (14% [P=0.05] and 14% [P=0.05] vs. 4%). Rates of 70% improvement were not significantly higher in the brodalumab groups. Similar degrees of improvement were noted among patients who had received previous biologic therapy and those who had not received such therapy. At week 24, ACR 20 response rates in the brodalumab 140-mg and 280-mg groups were 51% and 64%, respectively, as compared with 44% among patients who switched from placebo to open-label brodalumab; responses were sustained through week 52. At week 12, serious adverse events had occurred in 3% of patients in the brodalumab groups and in 2% of those in the placebo group. Brodalumab significantly improved response rates among patients with psoriatic arthritis. Larger studies of longer duration are necessary to assess adverse events.

In recent years, there has been an increasing understanding of the importance of the TH17 lineage of T cells and related cytokines, including interleukin (IL)17 and IL23, not only in the biology of innate host defense but also in the pathogenesis of inflammatory/autoimmune diseases. These diseases include psoriasis, psoriatic arthritis, the broader category of spondyloarthritides including ankylosing spondylitis and rheumatoid arthritis. It is postulated that in genetically predisposed individuals, external or internal stimuli such as microbial antigens, alterations in the intestinal microbiome, biomechanical stress and/or immunologic dysregulation may lead to an increased expression of cytokines such as IL23, which in turn stimulate the differentiation and activation of TH17 and other immune cells, which are a part of the innate immune system that trigger adaptive immune processes and chronic inflammatory diseases. Herein, we explore the effect of targeting this pathway therapeutically. New drugs that are designed to inhibit steps in this pathway, the IL12/IL23 inhibitor, ustekinumab, the IL17A inhibitors secukinumab and ixekizumab, the IL17A receptor inhibitor, brodalumab, and the IL23 inhibitors guselkumab and tildrakizumab, have demonstrated significant effectiveness in treating these diseases, particularly psoriasis, psoriatic arthritis and ankylosing spondylitis. This article reviews the relevant biology, efficacy and safety of new medications targeting the TH17 pathway, including inhibition of IL17 and IL23, particularly in psoriasis and psoriatic arthritis. Especially for patients who have not gained benefit from, lost effectiveness to or could not use antitumour necrosis factor (TNF) medications for safety or tolerability reasons, having effective medicines with an alternative mechanism of action will improve our ability to diminish disease activity impact on patient lives.

Psoriasis is a common chronic inflammatory disease of the skin. Current biologic therapies are highly effective in the treatment of psoriasis, transforming the lives of patients with this significantly disabling disease. Advances in the understanding of the immunological pathogenesis of psoriasis have led to the development of new biologic therapies, targeting specific inflammatory cytokines upregulated in psoriasis. These include the IL-17 antagonists, secukinumab, brodalumab and ixekizumab; the IL-23 antagonists, guselkumab and tildrakizumab; and the oral small molecule therapies, tofacitinib and apremilast. Here, we review evidence for the efficacy and safety of these novel psoriasis therapies, providing clinicians with an overview of the next era in immunotherapy for psoriasis.

"Psoriasis" is a chronic immune-mediated inflammatory disorder with epidermal hyperplasia. There is some evidence that the cytokine interleukin-17A (often known as IL-17), which is mainly produced by Th17 cells, has a role in the pathogenesis of psoriasis. "IL-17" is a pro-inflammatory cytokine mainly important in the host's defense against extracellular bacteria and fungi. The three new therapies with biologic drugs - brodalumab, secukinumab, and ixekizumab - all target the IL-17 signaling pathway. Secukinumab and ixekizumab neutralize IL-17A, while brodalumab blocks its receptor. Results from clinical trials have shown marked improvements in disease severity in patients with moderate-to-severe plaque psoriasis, using any of these three drugs. The biologic agents were generally well tolerated, but the duration of the trials was relatively short. In this review, we focus on the role of the IL-17 cytokine family in the pathogenesis of psoriasis; the efficacy, safety, and tolerability of brodalumab, secukinumab, and ixekizumab in clinical trials; and possible differences between targeting of the IL-17A receptor and targeting of the IL-17A ligand.

In this phase 2, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, dose-ranging study, we assessed the efficacy and safety of brodalumab (AMG 827), a human anti-interleukin-17-receptor monoclonal antibody, for the treatment of moderate-to-severe plaque psoriasis. We randomly assigned patients with a score of 12 or higher on the psoriasis area-and-severity index (PASI, on which scores range from 0 to 72, with higher scores indicating more severe disease) and with 10% or more of their body-surface area affected by psoriasis to receive brodalumab (70 mg, 140 mg, or 210 mg at day 1 and weeks 1, 2, 4, 6, 8, and 10 or 280 mg monthly) or placebo. The primary end point was the percentage improvement from baseline in the PASI score at week 12. Secondary end points included improvement of at least 75% and at least 90% in the PASI score and the score on the static physician's global assessment at week 12. A total of 198 patients underwent randomization. At week 12, the mean percentage improvements in the PASI score were 45.0% among patients receiving 70 mg of brodalumab, 85.9% among those receiving 140 mg, 86.3% among those receiving 210 mg, 76.0% among those receiving 280 mg, and 16.0% among those receiving placebo (P<0.001 for all comparisons with placebo). An improvement of at least 75% and at least 90% in the PASI score at week 12 was seen in 77% and 72%, respectively, of the patients in the 140-mg brodalumab group and in 82% and 75%, respectively, of the patients in the 210-mg group, as compared with 0% in the placebo group (P<0.001 for all comparisons). The percentage of patients with a static physician's global assessment of clear or minimal disease was 26%, 85%, 80%, and 69% with the 70-mg, 140-mg, 210-mg, and 280-mg doses, respectively, of brodalumab, as compared with 3% with placebo (P<0.01 for all comparisons with placebo). Two cases of grade 3 neutropenia were reported in the 210-mg brodalumab group. The most commonly reported adverse events in the combined brodalumab groups were nasopharyngitis (8%), upper respiratory tract infection (8%), and injection-site erythema (6%). Brodalumab significantly improved plaque psoriasis in this 12-week, phase 2 study. (Funded by Amgen; ClinicalTrials.gov number, NCT00975637.).
