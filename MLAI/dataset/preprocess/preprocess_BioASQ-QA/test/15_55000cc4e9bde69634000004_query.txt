Hirschsprung's Disease (HD) is a developmental disorder of enteric nervous system characterised by the absence of ganglion cells in submucosal (Meissner's) and myenteric (Aurbach's) plexuses of distal bowel. The purpose of the present study was to observe and report the morphological patterns of ganglion related enteric neuronal abnormalities in children presented with clinical features of (HD) in a Pakistani population. A total of 92 patients with clinical presentation of HD were enrolled between March 2009 and October 2009. Among them, 8 were excluded according to the exclusion criteria. After detailed history and physical examination, paraffin embedded H and E stained sections were prepared from the serial open biopsies from colorectum. The data was analysed using SPSS-17. Frequencies and percentages are given for qualitative variables. Non-parametric Binomial Chi-Square test was applied to observe within group associations and p<0.05 was considered statistically significant. Among 84 patients, 13 (15.5%) proved to be normally ganglionic whereas 71 (84.5%) showed ganglion related enteric neuronal abnormalities namely isolated hypoganglionosis 9 (12.7%), immaturity of ganglion cells 9 (12.7%), isolated hyperganglionosis (IND Type B) 2 (2.8%) and Hirschsprung's disease 51 (71.8%). Among HD group, 34 (66.7%) belonged to isolated form and 17 (33.3%) showed combined ganglion related abnormalities. Hirschsprung's disease is common in Pakistani population, followed by hypoganglionosis, immaturity of ganglion cells and IND type B. The presence of hypertrophic nerve fibres was significant in HD, hyperganglionosis and hypoganglionosis, whereas, no hypertrophic nerve fibres were appreciated in immaturity of ganglion cell group.

Hirschsprung disease (HSCR) is a congenital disorder characterized by an absence of ganglion cells in the nerve plexuses of the lower digestive tract. Although mutations in eight different genes (EDNRB, EDN3, ECE1, SOX10, RET, GDNF, NTN, SIP1) have been identified in affected individuals, it is now clear that RET and EDNRB are the primary genes implicated in the etiology of HSCR. All eight genes are involved in the early development of the enteric nervous system, and most act through two distinct biochemical pathways mediated by RET and EDNRB. Mutations in RET and EDNRB account for up to 50% and 5% of HSCR cases in the general population, respectively. Interaction between these two signaling pathways could modify RET expression and, therefore, HSCR phenotype. Here, we report the case of a 1-year-old Taiwanese boy who presented with abdominal distension since birth and bilious vomiting after feeding. HSCR (short-segment type) was diagnosed based on X-ray, lower gastrointestinal series and biopsy findings. Mutation analysis revealed a heterozygous T>C missense mutation in exon 1 of the EDNRB gene, that substitutes the highly conserved cysteine-90 residue in the extracellular domain of the G protein-coupled receptor with an arginine residue (C90R). No RET gene mutation was detected in this patient.

Hirschsprung disease (HSCR, aganglionic megacolon) is a common congenital malformation leading to bowel obstruction, with an incidence of 1/5,000 live births. It is characterized by the absence of intrinsic ganglion cells in the myenteric and submucosal plexuses along variable lengths of the gastrointestinal tract. As enteric neurons are derived from the vagal neural crest, HSCR is regarded as a neurocristopathy. On the basis of a skewed sex-ratio (M/F = 4/1) and a risk to relatives much higher than the incidence in the general population, HSCR has long been regarded as a sex-modified multifactorial disorder. Accordingly, segregation analysis suggested an incompletely penetrant dominant inheritance in HSCR families with aganglionosis extending beyond the sigmoid colon. We and others have mapped a dominant gene for HSCR to chromosome 10q11.2 and have ascribed the disease to mutations in the RET proto-oncogene. However, the lack of genotype-phenotype correlation, the low penetrance and the sex-dependent effect of RET mutations supported the existence of one or more modifier gene(s) in familial HSCR. In addition, thus far, RET mutations only accounted for 50% and 15-20% of familial and sporadic HSCR patients, respectively. RET encodes a tyrosine kinase receptor whose ligand was unknown. Recently, the Glial cell line-derived neurotrophic factor (GDNF) has been identified to be a ligand for RET. Moreover, Gdnf-/- knockout mutant mice display congenital intestinal aganglionosis and renal agenesis, a phenotype very similar to the Ret-/- mouse. These data prompted us to hypothesize that mutations of the gene encoding GDNF could either cause or modulate the HSCR phenotype in some cases.

Hirschsprung's disease (HSCR) is a congenital disorder characterized by an absence of intrinsic ganglion cells in the nerves forming the plexus of the lower intestine. The WNT signaling pathway is considered to play an important role in embryonic development. In the present study, we analyzed 2 polymorphisms of the WNT8A gene (rs78301778 and rs6596422) to determine their association with the risk and development of HSCR. Allele frequencies and genotype distributions were analyzed by sequence analysis in patients with HSCR and normal controls. Using real-time PCR, western blot analysis and immunohistochemistry, we detected the mRNA and protein expression of WNT8A in patients with HSCR. The data indicated that the differences in genotype distributions and allele frequencies of rs78301778 and rs6596422 between various clinical classiﬁcations were statistically signiﬁcant. The analysis of the mRNA and protein expression of WNT8A revealed that the expression of WNT8A was increased in the stenotic colon segments compared with the normal colon segments. In conclusion, the data presented in this study suggest that the WNT8A gene is involved in the susceptibility to HSCR, and plays an important role in the occurrence and development of HSCR. These findings warrant further investigation.

Hirschsprung disease (HSCR) is an inherited disorder characterised by absence of intrinsic ganglion cells in the distal gastrointestinal tract. Different susceptibility genes, involved in either the Ret-tyrosine kinase or the endothelin signalling pathways, contribute to HSCR phenotype. Interestingly, alterations of these genes are detected in only 30-50% of all HSCR patients, suggesting the involvement of modifier genes and/or additional genetic or environmental risk factors. In complex disorders common polymorphic variants can be associated with the disease phenotype, thus modifying the risk of recurrence. To investigate whether sequence variants of the RET proto-oncogene may be associated with the development of the HSCR phenotype, we analysed 92 Italian patients for the 2508C > T synonymous substitution in exon 14 (S836S) finding that the T allele is clearly less frequent than in control individuals (Fisher exact test P = 0.0002). On the other hand, this RET variant allele is overrepresented in patients affected with medullary thyroid carcinoma. Assuming a direct effect of this single-nucleotide polymorphism in predisposing to RET associated pathologies, we have performed functional tests which excluded any possible involvement of the C and T alleles in DNA-protein binding, transcript stability and RNA splicing and editing.

Hirschsprung disease (HSCR) is a congenital disorder characterized by an absence of intrinsic ganglion cells in the nerve plexuses of the lower colon. Our previous results showed increased semaphorin 3A (SEMA3A) expression may be the risk factor for HSCR pathology in a subset of patients. Therefore, the association between polymorphisms in SEMA3A and the risk of HSCR was examined. The genotypes of two SNPs (rs7804122 and rs797821) in the SEMA3A gene in 119 patients with HSCR and 93 controls were examined using PCR-sequencing to determine the contribution of SEMA3A to the HSCR phenotype. PCR reaction with cDNA template was also used to find out whether a novel mutation (Chr7:83634610A→T) influences the SEMA3A pre-mRNA splicing. Genotypes comprising allele G of rs7804122 (GG or AG) were over-represented in patients (48.74 vs. 24.8%; p = 0.0013) which indicated that the risk of HSCR was significantly higher among subjects with the GG or AG genotype than among the subjects with the AA genotype. No statistically significant associations were found for SNP rs797821 at the allele or genotype levels. The differences in genotypes and allele distributions of rs7804122 and rs797821 between various clinical classifications were not statistically significant. The novel heterozygous mutation (Chr7:83634610A→T) 30bp away from an intron/exon boundary, had no detectable effect on splicing efficiency. Our results for rs7804122 provided preliminary evidence that the SEMA3A gene is involved in the susceptibility to HSCR in the Northeastern Chinese population.

Hirschsprung disease (HSCR) is a neurocristopathy characterized by the absence of parasympathetic intrinsic ganglion cells in the submucosal and myenteric plexuses along a variable portion of the intestinal tract. In approximately 18% of the cases HSCR also presents with multiple congenital anomalies including recognized syndromes. A combination of MLPA and microarray data analysis have been undertaken to refine a duplication at the Xq28 region. In this study we present a new clinical association of severe neonatal encephalopathy (Lubs syndrome) and HSCR, in a male patient carrying a duplication at the Xq28 region which encompasses the MECP2 and L1CAM genes. While the encephalopathy has been traditionally attributed to the MECP2 gene duplication in patients with Lubs syndrome, here we propose that the enteric phenotype in our patient might be due to the dosage variation of the L1CAM protein, together with additional molecular events not identified yet. This would be in agreement with the hypothesis previously forwarded that mutations in L1CAM may be involved in HSCR development in association with a predisposing genetic background.

Hirschsprung's disease is an inherited disorder characterized by the absence of ganglion cells in the distal bowel. Neurocutaneous melanosis is a rare congenital syndrome characterized by proliferation of melanin-producing cells in the skin and leptomeninges. The authors described a newborn patient with neurocutaneous melanosis associated with Hirschsprung's disease. This male baby had congenital hydrocephalus, large and multiple pigmented skin nevi, and severe abdominal distension. He showed marked hydrocephalus at birth and underwent a ventriculo-peritoneal shunt at the age of 5 days. Investigations for gut motility disorders revealed typical findings consistent with Hirschsprung's disease involving the rectosigmoid colon. He was surgically treated for Hirschsprung's disease after transanal endorectal pull-through at the age of 7 months. After settlement of the ventriculo-peritoneal shunt, the transanal approach was of significant value for keeping the intraperitoneal catheter clean. The association of developmental disorders of melanocytes and enteric ganglia, both of which originated from the neural crest, suggested the presence of mutual pathogenetic factors in the patient.

Hirschsprung disease (HSCR) is a frequent congenital disorder (1 in 5,000 newborns) of unknown origin characterized by the absence of parasympathetic intrinsic ganglion cells of the hindgut. Taking advantage of a proximal deletion of chromosome 10q (del 10q11.2-q21.2) in a patient with total colonic aganglionosis, and of a high-density genetic map of microsatellite DNA markers, we performed genetic linkage analysis in 15 non-syndromic long-segment and short-segment HSCR families. Multipoint linkage analysis indicated that the most likely location for a HSCR locus is between loci D10S208 and D10S196, suggesting that a dominant gene for HSCR maps to 10q11.2, a region to which other neural crest defects have been mapped.

Hirschsprung's disease (HSCR) is a congenital intestinal disease, characterized by the absence of ganglion cells in the distal portion of the intestinal tract. Recently, three susceptibility genes have been identified in HSCR, namely the RET protooncogene, the endothelin B (ETB) receptor gene (EDNRB), and the endothelin-3 (ET-3) gene (EDN3). To investigate whether mutations in EDNRB could be related with HSCR in non-inbred populations in Japan, we examined alterations of the gene in 31 isolated patients. Three novel mutations were detected as follows: two transversions, A to T and C to A at nucleotides 311 (N104I) and 1170 (S390R), respectively, and a transition, T to C at nucleotide 325 (C109R). To analyze functions of these mutant receptors, they were expressed in Chinese hamster ovary cells. S390R mutation did not change the binding affinities but caused the decreases in the ligand-induced increment of intracellular calcium and in the inhibition of adenylyl cyclase activity, showing the impairment of the intracellular signaling. C109R receptors were proved to be localized near the nuclei as an unusual 44-kDa protein with the extremely low affinity to endothelin-1 (ET-1) and not to be translocated into the plasma membrane. On the other hand, N104I receptors showed almost the same binding affinities and functional properties as those of the wild type. Therefore, we conclude that S390R and C109R mutations could cause HSCR but that N104I mutation might be polymorphous.

Hirschsprung disease (HSCR) is a congenital disorder characterized by the absence of intramural ganglion cells along with variable lengths of the gastrointestinal tract. Recent studies have indicated the potential function of neuregulin-1 (NRG1) in HSCR, which encodes the heregulins and other mitogenic ligands for the ErbB family. The purpose of this study was to further clarify the role of NRG1 in the pathogenesis of HSCR. We examined the NRG1 messenger RNA (messenger RNA) and protein expression levels in gut tissues of 63 patients with sporadic HSCR (both stenotic and dilated gut tissues) and 35 controls. Moreover, using the methylation-specific polymerase chain reaction, we examined the methylation pattern of exon 1 of the NRG1 gene. The mRNA expression levels of NRG1 were significantly higher in tissues of HSCR than those in controls, and the increased NRG1 protein levels in HSCR were consistent with the mRNA levels. However, no methylation pattern change was observed in exon 1 of the gene among different groups. Our study demonstrates that the aberrant expression of NRG1 may play an important role in the pathology of HSCR. DNA methylation of the gene seems not to be involved in the mechanism of such aberrant expression, and other factors should be explored.

Hirschsprung's disease (HSCR), also known as aganglionic megacolon, derives from a congenital malformation of the enteric nervous system (ENS). It displays an incidence of 1 in 5000 live births with a 4:1 male to female sex ratio. Clinical signs include severe constipation and distended bowel due to a non-motile colon. If left untreated, aganglionic megacolon is lethal. This severe congenital condition is caused by the absence of colonic neural ganglia and thus lack of intrinsic innervation of the colon due in turn to improper colonization of the developing intestines by ENS progenitor cells. These progenitor cells are derived from a transient stem cell population called neural crest cells (NCC). The genetics of HSCR is complex and can involve mutations in multiple genes. However, it is estimated that mutations in known genes account for less than half of the cases of HSCR observed clinically. The male sex bias is currently unexplained. The objective of this review is to provide an overview of the pathophysiology and genetics of HSCR, within the context of our current knowledge of NCC development, sex chromosome genetics and laboratory models.

Hirschsprung disease (HSCR) is a congenital disorder associated with the absence of intrinsic ganglion cells in the distal gastrointestinal tract. Recently, many missense, nonsense and frameshift mutations of the ret proto-oncogene were found in familial and sporadic cases of HSCR. Consistent with the view that the HSCR phenotype is the result of inactivation of Ret, the missense mutations detected in the tyrosine kinase domain were demonstrated to result in a marked decrease of the kinase activity of Ret. However, the effects of missense mutations found in the extracellular domain remain unknown. We now report that five mutations in the extracellular domain examined inhibit transport of the Ret protein to the plasma membrane. As a consequence, they significantly decreased the transforming activity of Ret with multiple endocrine neoplasia (MEN) 2A mutation for which cell surface expression is required. Our results also demonstrated that long segment HSCR mutations more severely impair transport of Ret to the plasma membrane than a short segment HSCR mutation, suggesting that the level of its cell surface expression may correlate to the HSCR phenotype.

Hirschsprung disease (HSCR) is a congenital disease characterized by the absence of ganglion cells in various length of distal digestive tract. The rearranged during transfection gene (RET) is considered the major gene in HSCR. Although an increasing number of HSCR-associated RET coding sequence (CDS) mutations have been identified in recent years, not many have been investigated for functional consequence on the RET protein. We examined the functional implications of the de novo RET-CDS mutations V145G, Y483X, V636fsX1, and F961L that we first identified in sporadic Chinese patients with HSCR. The V145G disrupted RET glycosylation and F961L RET phosphorylation. Presumably, the truncation mutations would affect the translocation or the anchoring of the RET protein onto the cellular membrane. The study of RET-CDS mutations that appear de novo is essential not only for understanding the mechanistic of the disease but also for penetrance and recurrence risk estimations, being the ultimate goal for the improvement in disease management and counseling.

Hirschsprung disease (HSCR) is a congenital disorder characterized by an absence of intrinsic ganglion cells in the nerve plexuses of the lower colon. The Semaphorin 3A (SEMA3A) gene is involved in the migration of enteric neural precursors (ENPs). To analyze the function of SEMA3A in HSCR, the SEMA3A expression in different colon segments in HSCR was examined. The expression levels of SEMA3A in both ganglionic and aganglionic colon tissues of 32 patients with HSCR and in colon tissue of 5 newborn unaffected individuals were examined by real-time RT-PCR, Western-blot, and immunohistology. Comparison of SEMA3A expression levels between ganglionic and aganglionic tissues in HSCR revealed upregulation of SEMA3A expression in 43.75% (14/32) of the aganglionic colons. SEMA3A was expressed in the ganglion cells of the myenteric plexus, submucosa, as well as in the longitudinal and circular muscle layer of the normal colon of both unaffected newborns and patients with HSCR. In the aganglionic segment of patients with HSCR, SEMA3A was highly expressed in the circular muscle layer and was also detected in the submucosa and in the longitudinal muscles layer. The fluorescence intensity of SEMA3A in the circular muscle layer in the aganglionic segment was much higher than that in ganglionic segment (p < .001). SEMA3A expression was upregulated in the aganglionic smooth muscle layer of the colon in some patients with HSCR and our data suggest that increased SEMA3A expression may be a risk factor for HSCR pathology in a subset of patients.
