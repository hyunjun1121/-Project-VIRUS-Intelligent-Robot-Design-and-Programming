To assess the reproducibility of aortic volume estimates and to serially test their use in patients with Marfan syndrome. The study was approved by the medical ethics committee and all subjects gave written informed consent. In 81 patients with Marfan syndrome and seven healthy control subjects, aortic volumes and diameters at baseline were estimated by means of contrast material-enhanced magnetic resonance (MR) imaging. At 3 years of follow-up, aortic expansion rate were calculated in a subgroup of 22 patients with Marfan syndrome. Total aortic volume was defined as volume measurement from the level of the aortic annulus to the aortic bifurcation. Intra- and interobserver agreement of aortic volume were calculated by using the intraclass correlation coefficient. Differences in variables were analyzed with the Student t test and logistic regression. Effect size was calculated. Intra- and interobserver agreement of aortic volume calculation was 0.996 and 0.980, respectively. Mean aortic volume was significantly greater in patients with Marfan syndrome than in control subjects (104 mL/m(2); 95% confidence interval [CI]: 95, 114 mL/m(2) vs 74 mL/m(2); 95% CI: 62, 87 mL/m(2); P < .001). In 22 patients with Marfan syndrome, mean aortic volume was increased at 3 years of follow-up (17 mL; 95% CI: 8, 26 mL; P = .001; effect size, 0.29), while mean aortic diameter did not increase significantly (0.4 mm; 95% CI: 0.0, 0.9 mm; P = .171; effect size, 0.13). Assessment of aortic volume is highly reproducible and may be suited for use in the detection of aortic expansion in patients with Marfan syndrome. http://radiology.rsna.org/lookup/suppl/doi:10.1148/radiol.13122310/-/DC1.

The authors examined the state of patients suffering from Marfan syndrome (MS) who endured operation for ascending aorta aneurysm with replacement of the ascending aorta and aortic valve (Bentall operation), studying alterations of the skeleton, face, heart and eyes, as well as pathomorphological restructurings in the aortic wall. The study was carried out 7.0 ± 4.2 years after the operation. We examined a total of 39 patients with MS - 27 (69.2%) men and 12 (30.8%) women aged from 22 to 70 years old (average age - 42.1 ± 13.4 years). All patients were operated on for dissecting aneurysm of the ascending aorta accompanied by a considerable degree of aortic valve insufficiency or aortic ostium stenosis. The mean diameter of the aorta at the level of the sinuses of Valsalva amounted to 7.0 ± 1.3 cm (minimal - 5.0 cm, maximal - 12.0 cm), the Z-score prior to operation was 12.7 ± 6.5. The time form making the diagnosis of MS to surgical intervention for aortic aneurysm amounted to 9.6 ± 5.9 years. The condition after operative treatment in all patients was satisfactory, with the haemodynamic indices stable: systolic AP - 133.5 ± 19.1 mm Hg, diastolic AP 85.1 ± 12.9 mm Hg, heart rate 74.8 ± 7.2 bpm. The average systemic score for the symptoms and tests of MS patients amounted to 8.2 ± 3.3 points. Pathohistological alterations of the aorta in patients with Marfan syndrome consisted in pronounced restructuring of the wall with deep irreversible alternative changes. The pathological process extended in the middle aortic layer all alone the length, but not only in the portions of rupture and dissection. The main pathomorphological signs in MS were as follows: focal accumulations of mucoid substances, dystrophic alterations of smooth-muscle cells, ribbon-like anuclear zones, formation of cystlike cavities, alterations of elastic fibres - fragmentation, hyperelastosis, multiplication, thinning and straightening, zones of elastolysis.

To compare the clinical features of type A aortic dissection (AAD) in patients with Marfan syndrome (MFS) and bicuspid aortic valves (BAV). Data from patients undergoing surgery for acute AAD between April 2008 and April 2012 at our institute were retrospectively collected. Patients were categorized into MFS group (n = 39) and BAV group (n = 28) to investigate their clinical and prognostic features. Patients in MFS and BAV groups always experienced the sudden onset of chest pain. MFS patients tended to have younger age [(35 ± 8) y vs (47 ± 13) y, P < 0.001], wider aortic sinus [(55.4 ± 9.8) mm vs (42.6 ± 8.6) mm, P < 0.01] and higher rate of moderate-to-severe aortic regurgitation (69.2% vs 32.1%, P = 0.003). Patients in BAV group were featured with higher rate of moderate-to-severe aortic stenosis. Though the operation procedures were similar in both groups, the 30-day postoperative mortality was significantly higher among BAV patients (25.0% vs 5.1%, P = 0.020). MFS and BAV represent unique subgroups of acute type A aortic dissection. BAV-associated dissection demonstrated strikingly higher postoperative mortality in our study population.

The diagnosis and surgical treatment of patients with Marfan syndrome remain controversial. It is of utmost importance to identify patients at risk for acute aortic events to establish the correct surgical timing and the appropriate surgical treatment. From May 2008 to December 2012, 500 patients were screened at the Marfan Presidium of the Tor Vergata University Hospital of Rome (Italy). Patients were evaluated by a cardiac surgeon, including echocardiographic, orthopedic, ophthalmologic and dental examinations. All patients received genetic counseling, and genetic sampling was performed if appropriate. The diagnosis of Marfan syndrome was confirmed in 146 patients (29.2%). Fifty-four patients (37%) underwent cardiac surgery on the aortic root, 4 patients had surgery on the mitral valve, 13 patients had combined surgery; 11 cases were emergent surgery for acute aortic dissection. Twenty-eight patients (52%) were operated on at our Division: 13 underwent valve-sparing aortic root replacement (David procedure), 1 underwent Yacoub remodeling procedure and 14 underwent Bentall procedure. Following the establishment of the Marfan Center, the David aortic valve-sparing operation was the most frequently performed procedure compared to the previous period of surgical activity (63 vs 22%, p<0.0001). Regular follow-up twice a year may allow to identify patients at risk for acute aortic syndromes. Early surgical treatment is recommended in these patients to achieve optimal results of valve-sparing procedures and life-saving management, especially for patients who live far away from a cardiac surgery center.

For the first time Bernhard Marfan described the Marfan-Syndrome in 1896; it is a meso- and ectodermed variety with the conducting symptom of "arachnodactyly". Marfan-Syndrome is an autosomal dominant hereditary disorder with high penetrance and variable expressivity. In our opinion this case of a 41-year-old patient with kidney cysts and aneurysma dissecans of the arteria ascendens by Marfan-Syndrome was described in the literature only twice. The casuistics of this Marfan-Syndrome patient shows a particular rare associated organ-change--the kidney cysts--and illustrate the frequency of this hereditary disease.

Stanford type A aortic dissection is a rare phenomenon with high short-term mortality and clinical manifestations that can make differential diagnosis a lengthy process requiring several diagnostic examinations. Based on a case report, the aim is to highlight the importance of physical examination in the initial management of these patients and of rapid access to a surgical center. A brief review follows on the diagnosis and treatment of ascending aortic dissection, and its specific nature in Marfan syndrome. A 33-year-old man was admitted to the emergency department of a district hospital with chest and back pain associated with vomiting, 20 hours after symptom onset. Initial physical examination revealed an aortic systolic murmur and musculoskeletal morphological abnormalities compatible with Marfan syndrome. Given suspected aortic dissection, a transthoracic echocardiogram was immediately performed, which showed an extensive intimal flap originating at the sinotubular junction. He was transferred to the cardiothoracic surgery department of a referral hospital where he was treated by a Bentall procedure. In this case, careful physical examination during initial assessment raised the suspicion that this patient was in a high-risk group for aortic dissection, thus avoiding unnecessary and lengthy exams. This diagnosis requires emergent surgical treatment, and so direct contact in real time between those making in the diagnosis and the surgeon is essential, as well as protocols governing immediate access to a surgical center.

Imaging and color flow Doppler echocardiography are an integral part of any evaluation of a patient with the Marfan syndrome. The major cardiovascular manifestations of this condition are aortic dilation, which may involve the proximal and distal aorta, aortic regurgitation, aortic dissection, mitral valve prolapse, and mitral regurgitation. Patients who have the Marfan syndrome should have serial echocardiograms to measure aortic root diameter carefully at the sinuses of Valsalva and subsequent levels (sinotubular junction, arch, descending and abdominal aorta). Additionally, color Doppler echocardiography assists in the diagnosis of aortic dissection and facilitates evaluation of the severity of aortic and mitral regurgitation that commonly complicate the Marfan syndrome. The risk of aortic dissection, which is the most serious manifestation of the Marfan syndrome, increases as the aorta enlarges. Therefore, elective composite graft surgery is recommended when the aortic root size reaches 60 mm, regardless of symptom status, or 55 mm in the presence of severe aortic regurgitation. Surgical replacement of the aortic root with a composite graft does not end the disease process. Color flow Doppler is useful in the diagnosis of dehiscence of the conduit sewing ring, coronary artery aneurysm, distal aortic dissections, and prosthetic valve dysfunction.

Marfan syndrome (MFS) is one of the most common systemic disorders of connective tissue with the incidence of approximately 2-3 per 10 000 individuals. Aortic disease, leading to progressive aneurysmal dilatation and dissection is the main cause of morbidity and mortality of Marfan patients. Current treatment (e.g. beta blockers and elective surgery) does postpone but cannot prevent aortic complications in these patients. Recent studies have found transforming growth factor beta (TGF beta) to be involved in the aortic aneurysm formation. Losartan, an angiotensin II type 1 receptor blocker inhibits TGFbeta in a mouse model of Marfan syndrome leading to inhibition of aortic growth. The main objective of this trial is to assess whether losartan treatment leads to a clinically relevant decrease of aortic dilatation in adult patients with Marfan syndrome. COMPARE study (COzaar in Marfan Patients Reduces aortic Enlargement) is an open-label, randomized, controlled trial with blinded end-points. Treatment with losartan will be compared with no additional treatment after 3 years of follow-up. We will enroll 330 patients with MFS who will be randomly assigned to receive losartan or not. Patients taking beta-blockers will continue taking their standard treatment. The primary end-point is the largest change in aortic diameter at any aortic level measured by means of MRI. Secondary end-points are change in mortality, incidence of dissection, elective aortic surgery, aortic volume, aortic stiffness and ventricular function. We will also investigate gene and protein expression change in the skin under losartan therapy and create prediction models for losartan-treatment response and aortic dilatation. The COMPARE study will provide important evidence of effects of losartan treatment in adult Marfan patient population. We expect losartan to significantly reduce the occurrence and progression of aortic dilatation. This trial investigates a wide spectrum of clinical, genetic and biochemical effects of losartan aiming to provide further insight in the pathogenesis and treatment of Marfan syndrome.

The not-uncommon spinal abnormalities associated with Marfan's syndrome rarely undergird clinical problems, and neurological features accompanying such bone abnormalities are rare. In such unusual circumstances it is a widened vertebral canal that attracts attention: the substrate of such widening is dural ectasia with bone erosion, presumably due to hydraulic forces operating via the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF). When neural symptoms or findings do occur they may be related to stretching and traction mechanisms. This study of a symptomatic patient defined with reasonable clarity the abnormal anatomy, and some neurological symptom relief was achieved by attempting to alter the CSF dynamics. The relevant literature has been sampled to elucidate the condition.

Marfan syndrome is a multisystemic connective tissue disorder caused mainly by mutations in the fibrillin-1 gene. The entire cardiovascular system is affected in patients with Marfan syndrome. Aortic root dilatation, aortic valve regurgitation or - the most feared and life-threatening symptom - aortic root dissection are the most common manifestations. Therapeutic strategies, such as prophylactic aortic root surgery and pharmacological therapy, focus on the prevention of aortic dissection. Currently, the standard medicinal treatments targeting aortic dilatation and dissection consist of agents generally used to lower blood pressure and/or the inotropic state of the heart. By these means, the cyclic repetitive forces exerted on the aortic wall are diminished and thus the onset of aortic dilatation is potentially prevented. Although these pharmacological agents may offer some benefit in reduction of aortic aneurysm expansion rate, they do not target the underlying cause of the progressive aortic degradation. This review discusses the effectiveness of frequently prescribed medications used to prevent and delay aortic complications in Marfan syndrome. New insights on the biochemical pathways leading to aortic disease are also discussed to highlight new targets for pharmacological therapy. Recent insights in the transforming growth factor beta signaling pathway and inflammatory mechanisms in a well-established mouse model of Marfan syndrome, have led to studies exploring new pharmacological treatment strategies with doxycycline, statins and angiotensin II receptor blockers. Pharmacological therapy is focused more on prevention than on delay of aortic wall pathology in Marfan syndrome. Of the new pharmacological treatment strategies targeting aortic pathology in Marfan syndrome, angiotensin receptor type 1 blockers are promising candidates, with several clinical trials currently ongoing.

Marfan syndrome is an inherited disorder characterized by genetic abnormality of microfibrillar connective tissue proteins. Endothelial dysfunction is thought to cause aortic dilation in subjects with a bicuspid aortic valve; however, the role of endothelial dysfunction and endothelial damaging factors has not been elucidated in Marfan syndrome. Flow-mediated dilation, a noninvasive measurement of endothelial function, was evaluated in 39 patients with Marfan syndrome. Aortic diameter was measured at the aortic annulus, aortic root at the sinus of Valsalva, sinotubular junction and ascending aorta by echocardiography, and adjusted for body surface area (BSA). The mean value of flow-mediated dilation was 6.5 ± 2.4 %. Flow-mediated dilation had a negative correlation with the diameter of the ascending thoracic aorta (AscAd)/BSA (R = -0.39, p = 0.020) and multivariate analysis revealed that flow-mediated dilation was an independent factor predicting AscAd/BSA, whereas other segments of the aorta had no association. Furthermore, Brinkman index had a somewhat greater influence on flow-mediated dilation (R = -0.42, p = 0.008). Although subjects who smoked tended to have a larger AscAd compared with non-smokers (AscA/BSA: 17.3 ± 1.8 versus 15.2 ± 3.0 mm/m(2), p = 0.013), there was no significant change in flow-mediated dilation, suggesting that smoking might affect aortic dilation via an independent pathway. Common atherogenic risks, such as impairment of flow-mediated dilation and smoking status, affected aortic dilation in subjects with Marfan syndrome.

Cardiovascular disease is the main cause of morbidity and mortality in patients with Marfan syndrome. Many patients with presumed Marfan syndrome do not meet current diagnostic criteria. This study reviews the surgical aspects of aortic disease in 300 patients referred with the diagnosis of Marfan syndrome. During a 16-year period, 300 patients with presumed Marfan syndrome underwent 398 operations on the aorta and branch arteries, including 125 aortic root operations, 59 aortic arch repairs, 31 descending thoracic aortic repairs, and 178 thoracoabdominal aortic repairs. Based on medical record review, patients were classified as confirmed Marfan syndrome if documented features satisfied current diagnostic criteria; patients not meeting these criteria were classified as suspected Marfan syndrome. There were 17 operative deaths (4.3%) after the 398 operations. Survival after the initial referral operation was 96.2% +/- 1.5% at 1 year, 82.7% +/- 2.4% at 5 years, and 74.6% +/- 3.1% at 10 years. Presentations, operative details, and outcomes were remarkably similar in the 137 patients (45.7%) with confirmed Marfan syndrome and the 163 patients (54.3%) with suspected Marfan syndrome. Freedom from repair failure, however, was significantly better in patients with confirmed Marfan syndrome (90.3% +/- 2.3% at 10 years) than in those with suspected Marfan syndrome (82.0% +/- 3.1% at 10 years; p = 0.001). Operative treatment of the full spectrum of aortic disease in Marfan patients enables excellent long-term survival. Similarities in surgical aspects of aortic disease suggest that patients with features of Marfan syndrome who do not meet diagnostic criteria should be managed in the same manner as patients with confirmed Marfan syndrome.

Aortic dissection (AoD) is one of the most common catastrophes involving the aorta. Nevertheless, early diagnosis remains to be a challenge in the Emergency Department (ED), particularly in young individuals. In this study, we attempted to identify the characteristics of acute AoD among young individuals, particular in patients with Marfan syndrome. This was an retrospective chart-review study conducted in a tertiary referring hospital. The hospital database was queried for the combination of AoD and patients under age of 40 years. The medical charts were reviewed to obtain demographic data, clinical data and laboratory characteristics by using a standardized data collection sheet. A comparison between Marfan syndrome and non-Marfan syndrome patients was performed. During the 10-years period, 18 of 344 patients with acute AoD were younger than 40 years-old. Patients with Marfan syndrome developed acute AoD at a younger age than patients without Marfan syndrome. The mean diastolic blood pressure was significantly lower in patients with Marfan syndrome upon presenting to the ED than those without. Patients with Marfan syndrome had trends toward higher risk of development of type A AoD, increased recurrence rate and higher mortality rate than those without. However, statistical significance was not present. ED physicians should have high alert to acute AoD in young patients presenting with severe unexplained chest and back pain, particularly in those patients with a history of heart diseases, hypertension, and Marfan syndrome or featuring Marfanoid habitus. Acute coronary syndrome, unexplained abdominal symptoms, and sudden cardiac arrest could be the initial manifestation of AoD in young patients. A low threshold to perform enhanced computed tomography may facilitate early diagnosis and timely treatment in this patient population.

Meningeal abnormalities such as dural ectasia are seen in Marfan syndrome, but spinal meningeal cysts are rarely seen. These cysts usually asymptomatic and often found incidentally on magnetic resonance imaging, large cysts may cause neurological deficits and pain secondary to nerve root compression. Case reports. Two patients with Marfan syndrome presented with urinary symptoms secondary to dural ectasia and sacral cysts. Patient 1 had a history of low back pain, erectile dysfunction, and occasional urinary incontinence and groin pain with recent symptom worsening. He underwent L5 partial laminectomy and S1-S2 laminectomy with sacral cyst decompression. Nine weeks later, he underwent drainage of a sacral pseudomeningocele. Pain and urinary symptoms resolved, and he remains neurologically normal 2 years after surgery. Patient 2 presented after a fall on his tailbone, complaining of low back pain and difficulty urinating. Physical therapy was implemented, but after 4 weeks, urinary retention had not improved. He then underwent resection of the sacral cyst and S1-S3 laminectomy. Pain and paresthesias resolved and bowel function returned to normal. Other than needing intermittent self-catheterization, all other neurologic findings were normal 30 months after surgery. Surgical goals for sacral cysts include resection as well as closure of the dura, which can be challenging due to thinning from ectasia. Neurosurgical intervention in Marfan syndrome is associated with a high risk of dural tears and osseous complications, and should be performed only when symptoms are severe.
