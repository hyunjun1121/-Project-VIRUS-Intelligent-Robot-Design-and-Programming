Which disease is treated with ZMapp?

[PMID: 25694097]
The 2014 outbreak clearly showed that Ebola viruses (EBOV) remain a substantial threat for public health. The mainstay of management of patients with Ebola disease is isolation of patients and use of strict barrier nursing procedures; the present treatment strategies are mainly symptomatic and supportive (fluid resuscitation, antypyretics, antidiarrheal drugs). Currently, there is no approved therapy for Ebola hemorrhagic fever (EHF), however several advanced treatment options were tested in animal models (on non-human primates or rodents). They include use of both symptomatic (e.g. use of tissue factor inhibitors - rhNAPc2, rhAPC - to abolish coagulopathy) and specific antiviral approaches: e.g. monoclonal anti EBOV antibodies (ZMapp, MB-003), phosphorodiamidate morpholino oligomers (PMOs), liposomes containing siRNA (LNP-siRNA:TKM-Ebola) and small molecule inhibitors (e.g. BCX4430, favipiravir). The scope of this article is to briefly review the most promising therapeutics for EHF, based on the data coming from rare clinical reports, studies on animals and results from in vitro models.

The reports for Ebola virus Zaire (EBOV), Nipah virus, and Machupo virus (MACV) pathogenesis, in this issue of Veterinary Pathology, are timely considering recent events, both nationally and internationally. EBOV, Nipah virus, and MACV cause highly lethal infections for which no Food and Drug Administration (FDA) licensed vaccines or therapies exist. Not only are there concerns that these agents could be used by those with malicious intent, but shifts in ecological distribution of viral reservoirs due to climate change or globalization could lead to more frequent infections within remote regions than previously seen as well as outbreaks in more populous areas. The current EBOV epidemic shows no sign of abating across 3 West African nations (as of October 2014), including densely populated areas, far outpacing infection rates of previous outbreaks. A limited number of cases have also arisen in the United States and Europe. With few treatment options for these deadly viruses, development of animal models reflective of human disease is paramount to combat these diseases. As an example of this potential, a new treatment compound, ZMapp, that had demonstrated efficacy against EBOV infection in nonhuman primates (NHPs) received an emergency compassionate use exception from the FDA for the treatment of 2 American medical workers infected with EBOV, and they are currently virus free and recovering.

Antibody therapy has been used to treat a variety of diseases and the success of ZMapp and other monoclonal antibody-based therapies during the 2014-2016 West African Ebola outbreak has shown this countermeasure can be a successful therapy for Ebola hemorrhagic fever. This study utilized transchromosomal bovines (TcB) vaccinated with a DNA plasmid encoding Ebola virus glycoprotein sequence to produce human polyclonal antibodies directed against Ebola virus glycoprotein. When administered 1 day postinfection, these TcB polyclonal antibodies provided partial protection and resulted in a 50% survival rate following a lethal challenge of Ebola virus Makona in rhesus macaques.

Filoviruses, including Ebola, have the potential to be transmitted via virus-laden droplets deposited onto mucus membranes. Protecting against such emerging pathogens will require understanding how they may transmit at mucosal surfaces and developing strategies to reinforce the airway mucus barrier. Here, we prepared Ebola pseudovirus (with Zaire strain glycoproteins) and used high-resolution multiple-particle tracking to track the motions of hundreds of individual pseudoviruses in fresh and undiluted human airway mucus isolated from extubated endotracheal tubes. We found that Ebola pseudovirus readily penetrates human airway mucus. Addition of ZMapp, a cocktail of Ebola-binding immunoglobulin G antibodies, effectively reduced mobility of Ebola pseudovirus in the same mucus secretions. Topical delivery of ZMapp to the mouse airways also facilitated rapid elimination of Ebola pseudovirus. Our work demonstrates that antibodies can immobilize virions in airway mucus and reduce access to the airway epithelium, highlighting topical delivery of pathogen-specific antibodies to the lungs as a potential prophylactic or therapeutic approach against emerging viruses or biowarfare agents.

The growing promise of plant-made biologics is highlighted by the success story of ZMapp™ as a potentially life-saving drug during the Ebola outbreak of 2014-2016. Current plant expression platforms offer features beyond the traditional advantages of low cost, high scalability, increased safety, and eukaryotic protein modification. Novel transient expression vectors have been developed that allow the production of vaccines and therapeutics at unprecedented speed to control potential pandemics or bioterrorism attacks. Plant-host engineering provides a method for producing proteins with unique and uniform mammalian post-translational modifications, providing opportunities to develop biologics with increased efficacy relative to their mammalian cell-produced counterparts. Recent demonstrations that plant-made proteins can function as biocontrol agents of foodborne pathogens further exemplify the potential utility of plant-based protein production. However, resolving the technical and regulatory challenges of commercial-scale production, garnering acceptance from large pharmaceutical companies, and obtaining U.S. Food and Drug Administration approval for several major classes of biologics are essential steps to fulfilling the untapped potential of this technology.

Cocktails of monoclonal antibodies (MAbs) that target the surface glycoprotein (GP) of Ebola virus (EBOV) are effective in nonhuman primate models and have been used under emergency compassionate-treatment protocols in human patients. However, the amino acids that form the detailed binding epitopes for the MAbs in the ZMapp, ZMAb, and the related MB-003 cocktails have yet to be identified. Other binding properties that define how each MAb functionally interacts with GP—such as affinity, epitope conservation, and epitope accessibility—also remain largely unknown. To help define how each MAb interacts with GP, here we used comprehensive alanine-scanning mutagenesis (shotgun mutagenesis), neutralization escape, and whole virion binding to define each MAb's specific epitope, epitope accessibility, epitope conservation, and apparent affinity. Each of the six therapeutic MAbs binds nonidentical epitopes in the GP base, glycan cap, or mucin-like domain. Their apparent affinity, epitope complementarity, and epitope accessibility helps explain why MAbs 4G7 and 13C6 are more protective than 2G4 and 1H3. The mucin-like domain MAbs 6D8 and 13F6 bind with the strongest apparent affinity, helping to explain their effectiveness in vivo despite their inability to neutralize virus. Ebola virus disease (EVD) can be caused by four different filovirus family members, including Ebola virus (EBOV), which infected 10 times more people in western Africa over the last year than all previous EVD outbreaks combined, with a number of cases distributed across the globe by travelers. Cocktails of inhibitory monoclonal antibodies (MAbs), such as ZMAb, MB-003, and in particular ZMapp, have demonstrated in animal models some of the most significant therapeutic potential for treating EVD, and in 2014, 15 patients were treated with ZMapp or ZMAb under compassionate-use protocols. Here, we have defined the epitope features for the most important therapeutic MAbs against EBOV developed to date. Defining the epitopes and binding characteristics for these MAbs, as well as the commonly used reference MAb KZ52, helps explain their breadth of reactivity against different ebolavirus species, predict viral evasion against these MAbs, and design new cocktails of MAbs with improved complementarity.

Ebola virus (EBOV) and related filoviruses cause severe hemorrhagic fever, with up to 90% lethality, and no treatments are approved for human use. Multiple recent outbreaks of EBOV and the likelihood of future human exposure highlight the need for pre- and postexposure treatments. Monoclonal antibody (mAb) cocktails are particularly attractive candidates due to their proven postexposure efficacy in nonhuman primate models of EBOV infection. Two candidate cocktails, MB-003 and ZMAb, have been extensively evaluated in both in vitro and in vivo studies. Recently, these two therapeutics have been combined into a new cocktail named ZMapp, which showed increased efficacy and has been given compassionately to some human patients. Epitope information and mechanism of action are currently unknown for most of the component mAbs. Here we provide single-particle EM reconstructions of every mAb in the ZMapp cocktail, as well as additional antibodies from MB-003 and ZMAb. Our results illuminate key and recurring sites of vulnerability on the EBOV glycoprotein and provide a structural rationale for the efficacy of ZMapp. Interestingly, two of its components recognize overlapping epitopes and compete with each other for binding. Going forward, this work now provides a basis for strategic selection of next-generation antibody cocktails against Ebola and related viruses and a model for predicting the impact of ZMapp on potential escape mutations in ongoing or future Ebola outbreaks.

The 2014-2015 Ebola virus (EBOV) outbreak in West Africa highlighted the urgent need for specific therapeutic interventions for infected patients. The human-mouse chimeric monoclonal antibody (mAb) cocktail ZMapp, previously shown to be efficacious in EBOV (variant Kikwit) lethally infected nonhuman primates (NHPs) when administration was initiated up to 5 days, was used in some patients during the outbreak. We show that a two-antibody cocktail, MIL77E, is fully protective in NHPs when administered at 50 mg/kg 3 days after challenge with a lethal dose of EBOV variant Makona, the virus responsible for the ongoing 2014-2015 outbreak, whereas a similar formulation of ZMapp protected two of three NHPs. The chimeric MIL77E mAb cocktail is produced in engineered Chinese hamster ovary cells and is based on mAbs c13C6 and c2G4 from ZMapp. The use of only two antibodies in MIL77E opens the door to a pan-ebolavirus cocktail.

ZMapp, a cocktail of three monoclonal antibodies (MAbs; c2G4, c4G7, and c13C6) against the ebolavirus (EBOV) glycoprotein (GP), shows promise for combatting outbreaks of EBOV, as occurred in West Africa in 2014. Prior studies showed that Fabs from these MAbs bind a soluble EBOV GP ectodomain and that MAbs c2G4 and c4G7, but not c13C6, neutralize infections in cell cultures. Using cryo-electron tomography, we extended these findings by characterizing the structures of c2G4, c4G7, and c13C6 IgGs bound to native, full-length GP from the West African 2014 isolate embedded in filamentous viruslike particles (VLPs). As with the isolated ectodomain, c13C6 bound to the glycan cap, whereas c2G4 and c4G7 bound to the base region of membrane-bound GP. The tomographic data suggest that all three MAbs bind with high occupancy and that the base-binding antibodies can potentially bridge neighboring GP spikes. Functional studies indicated that c2G4 and c4G7, but not c13C6, competitively inhibit entry of VLPs bearing EBOV GP into the host cell cytoplasm, without blocking trafficking of VLPs to NPC1(+) endolysosomes, where EBOV fuses. Moreover, c2G4 and c4G7 bind to and can block entry mediated by the primed (19-kDa) form of GP without impeding binding of the C-loop of NPC1, the endolysosomal receptor for EBOV. The most likely mode of action of c2G4 and c4G7 is therefore by inhibiting conformational changes in primed, NPC1-bound GP that initiate fusion between the viral and target membranes, similar to the action of certain broadly neutralizing antibodies against influenza hemagglutinin and HIV Env. The recent West African outbreak of ebolavirus caused the deaths of more than 11,000 individuals. Hence, there is an urgent need to be prepared with vaccines and therapeutics for similar future disasters. ZMapp, a cocktail of three MAbs directed against the ebolavirus glycoprotein, is a promising anti-ebolavirus therapeutic. Using cryo-electron tomography, we provide structural information on how each of the MAbs in this cocktail binds to the ebolavirus glycoprotein as it is displayed-embedded in the membrane and present at high density-on filamentous viruslike particles that recapitulate the surface structure and entry functions of ebolavirus. Moreover, after confirming that two of the MAbs bind to the same region in the base of the glycoprotein, we show that they competitively block the entry function of the glycoprotein and that they can do so after the glycoprotein is proteolytically primed and bound to its intracellular receptor, Niemann-Pick C1. These findings should inform future developments of ebolavirus therapeutics.

Ebola virus (EBOV) in humans causes a severe illness with high mortality rates. Several strategies have been developed in the past to treat EBOV infection, including the antibody cocktail ZMapp, which has been shown to be effective in nonhuman primate models of infection <sup>1</sup> and has been used under compassionate-treatment protocols in humans <sup>2</sup> . ZMapp is a mixture of three chimerized murine monoclonal antibodies (mAbs)<sup>3-6</sup> that target EBOV-specific epitopes on the surface glycoprotein<sup>7,8</sup>. However, ZMapp mAbs do not neutralize other species from the genus Ebolavirus, such as Bundibugyo virus (BDBV), Reston virus (RESTV) or Sudan virus (SUDV). Here, we describe three naturally occurring human cross-neutralizing mAbs, from BDBV survivors, that target an antigenic site in the canonical heptad repeat 2 (HR2) region near the membrane-proximal external region (MPER) of the glycoprotein. The identification of a conserved neutralizing antigenic site in the glycoprotein suggests that these mAbs could be used to design universal antibody therapeutics against diverse ebolavirus species. Furthermore, we found that immunization with a peptide comprising the HR2-MPER antigenic site elicits neutralizing antibodies in rabbits. Structural features determined by conserved residues in the antigenic site described here could inform an epitope-based vaccine design against infection caused by diverse ebolavirus species.

Recent successes with monoclonal antibody cocktails ZMapp(TM) and MIL77 against Ebola virus (EBOV) infections have reignited interest in antibody-based therapeutics. Since the production process for monoclonal antibodies can be prolonged and costly, alternative treatments should be investigated. We produced purified equine antisera from horses hyperimmunized with EBOV virus-like particles, and tested the post-exposure efficacy of the antisera in a mouse model of infection. BALB/c mice were given up to 2 mg of purified equine antisera per animal, at 30 minutes, 1 or 2 days post-infection (dpi), in which all animals survived. To decrease the possibility of serum sickness, the equine antisera was digested with pepsin to generate F(ab')2 fragments, with in vitro neutralizing activity comparable to whole immunoglobulin. Full protection was achieved with when treatment was initiated at 1 dpi, but the suboptimal protection observed with the 30 minute and 2 dpi groups demonstrate that in addition to virus neutralization, other Fc-dependent antibody mechanisms may also contribute to survival. Guinea pigs given 20 mg of antisera or F(ab')2 at or starting at 1 or 2 dpi were also fully protected from EBOV infection. These results justify future efficacy studies for purified equine products in NHPs.

The 2014-2015 outbreak of Ebola virus disease is the largest epidemic to date in terms of the number of cases, deaths, and affected areas. In October 2015, no antiviral agents had proven antiviral efficacy in patients. However, in September 2014, the World Health Organization inventoried and has since regularly updated a list of potential drug candidates with demonstrated antiviral efficacy in in vitro or animal models. This includes agents belonging to various therapeutic classes, namely direct antiviral agents (favipiravir and BCX4430), a combination of antibodies (ZMapp), type I interferons, RNA interference-based drugs (TKM-Ebola and AVI-7537), and anticoagulant drugs (rNAPc2). Here, we review the pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic information presently available for these drugs, using data obtained in healthy volunteers for pharmacokinetics and data obtained in human clinical trials or animal models for pharmacodynamics. Future studies evaluating these drugs in clinical trials are critical to confirm their efficacy in humans, propose appropriate doses, and evaluate the possibility of treatment combinations.

During the latest outbreak of Ebola virus disease in West Africa, monoclonal antibody therapy (e.g., ZMapp) was utilized to treat patients. However, due to the antigenic differences among the five ebolavirus species, the current therapeutic monoclonal antibodies are only effective against viruses of the species Zaire ebolavirus. Although this particular species has indeed caused the majority of human infections in Central and, recently, West Africa, other ebolavirus species (e.g., Sudan ebolavirus and Bundibugyo ebolavirus) have also repeatedly caused outbreaks in Central Africa and thus should not be neglected in the development of countermeasures against ebolaviruses. Here we report the generation of an ebolavirus glycoprotein-specific monoclonal antibody that effectively inhibits cellular entry of representative isolates of all known ebolavirus species in vitro and show its protective efficacy in mouse models of ebolavirus infections. This novel neutralizing monoclonal antibody targets a highly conserved internal fusion loop in the glycoprotein molecule and prevents membrane fusion of the viral envelope with cellular membranes. The discovery of this highly cross-neutralizing antibody provides a promising option for broad-acting ebolavirus antibody therapy and will accelerate the design of improved vaccines that can selectively elicit cross-neutralizing antibodies against multiple species of ebolaviruses.

Adeno-associated viral vectors can be used as a platform for delivering biological countermeasures against pandemic and biological threats. We show that vector delivery of two antibody components of the ZMapp product is effective in mice against systemic and airway challenge with a mouse-adapted strain of Ebola virus. This platform provides a generic manufacturing solution and overcomes some of the delivery challenges associated with repeated administration of the protective protein.

Vectored delivery of the ZMapp antibody cocktail (c2G4, c4G7, and c13C6) by using recombinant adeno-associated viruses (rAAVs) could be useful for preventive immunization against Ebola virus infections because rAAVs can generate long-term antibody expression. Three rAAVs (serotype 9) encoding chimeric ZMapp antibodies were produced by triple-plasmid transfection up to 10 L-scale in WAVE bioreactors using HEK293 cells grown in suspension/serum-free conditions. Efficacy of AAV-c2G4 via intravenous (i.v.), intramuscular (i.m.), and intranasal (i.n.) routes of administration was evaluated in mice with two different doses of 2.7 × 10<sup>10</sup> and 13.0 × 10<sup>10</sup> vector genomes (vg). The best protective efficacies after Ebola challenge were obtained with the i.v. and i.m. routes. Serum concentrations of ZMapp antibodies positively correlated with survivability. Efficacy of the rAAV-ZMapp cocktail was then evaluated at a higher dose of 30.0 × 10<sup>10</sup> vg. It conferred a more robust protection (90% i.v. and 60% i.m.) than rAAV-c4G7 (30%) and rAAV-c13C6 (70%), both administered separately at the same dose. Delivery of rAAV-c2G4 alone achieved up to 100% protection (100% i.v. and 90% i.m.) at the same dose. In conclusion, the preventive treatment was effective in mice. However, no advantage was observed for using the rAAV-ZMapp cocktail in comparison to the utilization of the single rAAV-c2G4.

Plant-made or "biofarmed" viral vaccines are some of the earliest products of the technology of plant molecular farming, and remain some of the brightest prospects for the success of this field. Proofs of principle and of efficacy exist for many candidate viral veterinary vaccines; the use of plant-made viral antigens and of monoclonal antibodies for therapy of animal and even human viral disease is also well established. This review explores some of the more prominent recent advances in the biofarming of viral vaccines and therapies, including the recent use of ZMapp for Ebolavirus infection, and explores some possible future applications of the technology.

Monoclonal antibody therapy has an important role to play as a post-exposure prophylactic and therapeutic for the treatment of viral infections, including emerging infections. For example, several patients of the present Ebola virus outbreak in West Africa were treated with ZMapp, a cocktail of three monoclonal antibodies which are expressed in Nicotiana benthamiana. The majority of monoclonal antibodies in clinical use are expressed in mammalian cell lines which offer native folding and glycosylation of the expressed antibody. Monoclonal antibody expression in vegetal systems offers advantages over expression in mammalian cell lines, including improved potential for scale up and reduced costs. In this paper, I highlight the advantages of an upcoming protozoal system for the expression of recombinant antibody formats. Leishmania tarentolae offers a robust, economical expression of proteins with mammalian glycosylation patterns expressed in stable cell lines and grown in suspension culture. Several advantages of this system make it particularly suited for use in developing contexts. Given the potential importance of monoclonal antibody therapy in the containment of emerging viral infections, novel and alternative strategies to improve production must be explored.

The Ebola virus disease (EVD), formerly known as a hemorrhagic fever and discovered in 1976, is dangerous, highly infectious disease with very high mortality. There are no licensed therapeutics against EVD, although a range of medicines and therapies are currently being evaluated. During the 2014 Ebola outbreak, an experimental drug named ZMapp was administered on an emergency basis to seven patients of which five were recovered. Currently, since February 2015, ZMapp is tested in clinical trials. ZMapp is a mixture (named a cocktail) of three chimaeric monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) of IgG class, which bind to three different epitopes on Ebola surface glycoprotein (GP). ZMapp was created by systematic selection of antibodies from two other three-component cocktails--MB-003 and ZMab the components of which were produced by rapid transient expression method in tobacco species of Australian origin--Nicotiana benthamiana. The ZMapp antibodies of pharmaceutical grade are manufactured in green-house grown N.benthamiana according to the cGMP (current Good Manufacturing Practice), using RAMP platform (Rapid Antibody Manufacturing Platform) and MagnICON system, which utilizes transient expression by magnifection method using viral vectors delivered to plant tissue by a bacterium--Agrobacterium tumefaciens. The applied glycosylation mutant of N.benthamiana (delta XTFT) synthesizes human-like, biantennary N-glycans, with terminal N-acetylglucoseamine and without typical of plants, immunogenic sugar epitopes-beta1,2-linked xylose and alpha1,3-linked fucose. Due to an absence of fucose on N-glycans attached to the Fc domains, the plant-produced anti-Ebola mAbs elicited significantly stronger antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC) than the analogous anti-Ebola mAbs with fucosylated (alpha1,6-linked fucose) N-glycans produced in a mammalian CHO cell line--the basic expression system for the industrial production of recombinant therapeutical glycoproteins. As far as a vaccine against Ebola virus disease is considered, so-called Ebola Immunogenic Complex (EIC) consisting of assembled molecules of a humanized IgG mAb--6D8 specific for Ebola GPI with GP1 fused to the C-terminus of the heavy chains, was obtained by transient expression in N. benthamiana.

To describe the current Ebola virus epidemic and the potential options for treatment and prevention of Ebola virus disease. A PubMed literature search (1976 through October 20, 2014) was conducted using the search term Ebola. Animal and human studies published in English were selected. Studies published within the past 5 years were the primary focus of this review. The current Ebola virus epidemic has primarily been contained in West Africa though it has subsequently spread to other areas, including the United States. The first patient in the United States infected with Ebola virus was diagnosed, treated, and expired in Texas. Two nurses caring for this patient also were diagnosed with Ebola virus and have been successfully treated. Treatment options for patients infected with Ebola virus are limited. Supportive therapy is centered on fluid resuscitation, electrolyte imbalance correction, treating complicating infections, and preventing complications of shock. Experimental therapies (ZMapp, brincidofovir, TKM-Ebola, and favipiravir) have been used during this current outbreak. Several medications such as amiodarone, chloroquine, and clomiphene may prevent the transmission of or treat Ebola virus. Different vaccine therapies are also in early-stage development. One of the vaccine strategies using recombinant vesicular stomatitis virus as a delivery vector has demonstrated efficacy when used for preexposure and postexposure prophylaxis. Ebola virus is highly virulent and fatal, and treatment options are limited. Several experimental and existing therapies may be options for preventing and treating Ebola virus disease.

Several patients with Ebola virus disease (EVD) managed in the United States have received ZMapp monoclonal antibodies, TKM-Ebola small interfering RNA, brincidofovir, and/or convalescent plasma as investigational therapeutics. To investigate whether treatment selected for Ebola virus (EBOV) mutations conferring resistance, viral sequencing was performed on RNA extracted from clinical blood specimens from patients with EVD following treatment, and putative viral targets were analyzed. We observed no major or minor EBOV mutations within regions targeted by therapeutics. This small subset of patients and clinical specimens suggests that evolution of resistance is not a direct consequence of antiviral treatment. As EVD antiviral treatments are introduced into wider use, it is essential that continuous viral full-genome surveillance is performed, to monitor for the emergence of escape mutations.

The epidemic caused by the Ebola virus in western Africa affects Guinea, Liberia, Sierra Leone, Nigeria, Mali and Senegal, and is the most serious to occur since the existence of this filovirus, which causes haemorrhagic fever, was first reported. This article reviews the epidemiological characteristics and clinical manifestations associated with the disease due to the Ebola virus. Until February 23, 2015 there have been 23,729 cases of Ebola, with a mortality rate of 40.1%. In the current epidemic, there are three ways the virus can be transmitted to human beings: contact with fluids and secretions from subjects already diagnosed with the disease, contact with dead bodies during burial ceremonies, and infection of relatives and healthcare personnel from as-yet undiagnosed patients. Ebola is the cause of a serious disease in humans. Following a period of incubation that can vary in length (2-21 days), a syndrome involving fever, headache, aching muscles, sore joints, vomiting and diarrhoea begins. The advanced phase is accompanied by haemorrhages, multiple organ failure, hypotension and shock. The incidence of neurological manifestations is unknown, but brain haemorrhages and post-infectious syndromes have been reported in other viral haemorrhagic fevers. Support care is vital. No proven effective treatment exists, although several patients have been treated with a cocktail of monoclonal antibodies (ZMapp). Early identification and diagnosis of suspected cases, isolation of sick patients and protective measures among healthcare staff are fundamental in the control of this epidemic.

A neonate born to an Ebola virus-positive woman was diagnosed with Ebola virus infection on her first day of life. The patient was treated with monoclonal antibodies (ZMapp), a buffy coat transfusion from an Ebola survivor, and the broad-spectrum antiviral GS-5734. On day 20, a venous blood specimen tested negative for Ebola virus by quantitative reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction. The patient was discharged in good health on day 33 of life. Further follow-up consultations showed age-appropriate weight gain and neurodevelopment at the age of 12 months. This patient is the first neonate documented to have survived congenital infection with Ebola virus.

Without an approved vaccine or treatments, Ebola outbreak management has been limited to palliative care and barrier methods to prevent transmission. These approaches, however, have yet to end the 2014 outbreak of Ebola after its prolonged presence in West Africa. Here we show that a combination of monoclonal antibodies (ZMapp), optimized from two previous antibody cocktails, is able to rescue 100% of rhesus macaques when treatment is initiated up to 5 days post-challenge. High fever, viraemia and abnormalities in blood count and blood chemistry were evident in many animals before ZMapp intervention. Advanced disease, as indicated by elevated liver enzymes, mucosal haemorrhages and generalized petechia could be reversed, leading to full recovery. ELISA and neutralizing antibody assays indicate that ZMapp is cross-reactive with the Guinean variant of Ebola. ZMapp exceeds the efficacy of any other therapeutics described so far, and results warrant further development of this cocktail for clinical use.

The Ebola virus, formally known as the Ebola hemorrhagic fever, is an acute viral syndrome causing sporadic outbreaks that have ravaged West Africa. Due to its extreme virulence and highly transmissible nature, Ebola has been classified as a category A bioweapon organism. Only recently have vaccine or drug regimens for the Ebola virus been developed, including Zmapp and peptides. In addition, existing drugs which have been repurposed toward anti-Ebola virus activity have been re-examined and are seen to be promising candidates toward combating Ebola. Drug development involving computational tools has been widely employed toward target-based drug design. Screening large libraries have greatly stimulated research toward effective anti-Ebola virus drug regimens. Current emphasis has been placed on the investigation of host proteins and druggable viral targets. There is a huge gap in the literature regarding guidelines in the discovery of Ebola virus inhibitors, which may be due to the lack of information on the Ebola drug targets, binding sites, and mechanism of action of the virus. This review focuses on Ebola virus inhibitors, drugs which could be repurposed to combat the Ebola virus, computational methods which study drug-target interactions as well as providing further insight into the mode of action of the Ebola virus.

Since the first case of Ebola virus disease (EVD) in Guinea was reported in March 2014 by World Health Organization (WHO), the outbreak has continued through the year and the total number of 19,065 patients was reported as the confirmed or suspected in the EVD-affected countries. Among the cases, 7,388 patients were reported death by 19 December. Currently, available therapeutics to treat the infected patients or vaccines to prevent people from infection is not developed yet while viral diagnostic methods were already developed and firmly established in a lot of countries as a first step for the preparedness of Ebola outbreak. Some potential therapeutic materials including ZMapp were supplied and the treated people got over the EVD. Several candidates of vaccines also were investigated their efficacy in animal models by National Institute of Health (NIH) and Department of Defense, and they are processing of clinical tests in West Africa aiming to finish the development by the 2015. Vaccine and therapeutic development is essential to stop the EVD outbreak in West Africa, also to protect the world from the risk which can be generated by potential spread of Ebola virus.

To date, the management of patients with suspected or confirmed Ebolavirus disease (EVD) depends on quarantine, symptomatic management and supportive care, as there are no approved vaccines or treatments available for human use. However, accelerated by the recent large outbreak in West Africa, significant progress has been made towards vaccine development but also towards specific treatment with convalescent plasma and monoclonal antibodies. Areas covered: We describe recent developments in monoclonal antibody treatment for EVD, encompassing mAb114 and the MB-003, ZMAb, ZMapp™ and MIL-77E cocktails. Expert opinion: Preventive measures, are, and will remain essential to curb EVD outbreaks; even more so with vaccine development progressing. However, research for treatment options must not be neglected. Small-scale animal and individual human case studies show that monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) can be effective for EVD treatment; thus justifying exploration in clinical trials. Potential limitations are that high doses may be needed to yield clinical efficacy; epitope mutations might reduce efficacy; and constant evolution of (outbreak-specific) mAb mixtures might be required. Interim advice based on the clinical experience to date is that treatment of patients with mAbs is sensible, provided those could be made available in the necessary amounts in time.

There has clearly been a deluge of international press coverage of the recent outbreak of Ebolavirus in Africa and is partly related to the "fear factor" that comes across when one is confronted with the fact that once infected, not only is the speed of death in a majority of cases rapid but also the images of the cause of death such as bleeding from various orifices gruesome and frightening. The fact that it leads to infection and death of health care providers (10% during the current epidemic) and the visualization of protective gear worn by these individuals to contain such infection adds to this "fear factor". Finally, there is a clear perceived notion that such an agent can be utilized as a bioterrorism agent that adds to the apprehension. Thus, in efforts to gain an objective view of the growing threat Ebolavirus poses to the general public, it is important to provide some basic understanding for the lethality of Ebolavirus infection that is highlighted in Fig. 1. This virus infection first appears to disable the immune system (the very system needed to fight the infection) and subsequently disables the vascular system that leads to blood leakage (hemorrhage), hypotension, drop in blood pressure, followed by shock and death. The virus appears to sequentially infect dendritic cells disabling the interferon system (one of the major host anti-viral immune systems) then macrophages (that trigger the formation of blood clots, release of inflammatory proteins and nitric oxide damaging the lining of blood vessels leading to blood leakage) and finally endothelial cells that contribute to blood leakage. The virus also affects organs such as the liver (that dysregulates the formation of coagulation proteins), the adrenal gland (that destroys the ability of the patient to synthesize steroids and leads to circulation failure and disabling of regulators of blood pressure) and the gastro-intestinal tract (leading to diarrhea). The ability of the virus to disable such major mechanisms in the body facilitates the ability of the virus to replicate in an uncontrolled fashion leading to the rapidity by which the virus can cause lethality. Various laboratories have been working on defining such mechanisms utilizing in vitro culture systems, a variety of animal models including inbred strains of normal and select gene knock out mice, guinea pigs and nonhuman primates that have led to a better understanding of the potential mechanisms involved. There have also been some major advances made in the identification of therapies from the very simple (major supportive type of therapy), to the identification of a number of highly effective chemotherapeutic agents, a variety of highly effective preventive (demonstrating 100% effectiveness in nonhuman primate models) recombinant formulations (adenovirus based, VSV-based, rabies virus based), therapeutic candidate vaccines (cocktail of monoclonal antibodies such as ZMAPP) and alternate approaches (RNAi-based such as TKM-Ebola and antisense based such as AVI-7537) that show great promise and at an unprecedented rate of discovery that speaks well for the scientific research community at large.

Ebola virus (EBOV) is highly pathogenic, with a predisposition to cause outbreaks in human populations accompanied by significant mortality. An ovine polyclonal antibody therapy has been developed against EBOV, named EBOTAb. When tested in the stringent guinea pig model of EBOV disease, EBOTAb has been shown to confer protection at levels of 83.3%, 50% and 33.3% when treatment was first started on days 3, 4 and 5 post-challenge, respectively. These timepoints of when EBOTAb treatment was initiated correspond to when levels of EBOV are detectable in the circulation and thus mimic when treatment would likely be initiated in human infection. The effects of EBOTAb were compared with those of a monoclonal antibody cocktail, ZMapp, when delivered on day 3 post-challenge. Results showed ZMapp to confer complete protection against lethal EBOV challenge in the guinea pig model at this timepoint. The data reported demonstrate that EBOTAb is an effective treatment against EBOV disease, even when delivered late after infection.

This paper examines how people in West Africa are reacting to the Ebola virus disease, an epidemic presently prevalent in the region. Certain lifestyle changes are suggested. Additionally, the heart of the paper focuses on the request by governments to be allowed access to experimental drugs, such as Zmapp and TKM-Ebola, for their infected populations. The author argues that granting such a request would circumvent research ethics procedures, which could potentially constitute significant risk to users of the drugs. The Pfizer Kano meningitis trial of 1996 is cited as an example to buttress how unapproved drugs could prove fatal.

The 2014-2016 Ebola virus outbreak in West Africa was the deadliest in history, prompting the evaluation of various drug candidates, including antibody-based therapeutics for the treatment of Ebola hemorrhagic fever (EHF). Prior to 2014, only convalescent blood products from EHF survivors had been administered to newly infected individuals as a form of treatment. However, during the recent outbreak, monoclonal antibody cocktails such as ZMapp, ZMAb and MB-003 were either tested in a human clinical safety and efficacy trial or provided to some based on compassionate grounds. This review aims to discuss the evolution of antibody-based treatments for EHF, their clinical trial efficacy and the development of new antibody-based therapies currently advancing in preclinical testing.

The 2014 outbreak of Ebola virus disease (EVD) in West Africa, caused by Ebola virus (Zaire Ebola virus species), is the largest outbreak of EVD in history. It cause hemorrhagic fever in human and nonhuman primates with high mortality rate up to 90% and can be transmitted by direct contact with blood, body fluids, skin of EVD patients or persons who have died of EVD. As of December 17, 2014, 450 healthcare personnel are known to have been infected with Ebola, of whom 244 died. For development of Ebola vaccine and treatment are highly difficult due to its dangerous and accessibility that requires biosafety level 4 (BSL-4) to conduct experiment. Also there is no specific vaccine and treatment for Ebola virus; however, many candidate vaccines and antiviral-drugs such as ZMapp and TKM-Ebola are being developed for Ebola virus disease. In this review, we focus on the epidemiology of 2014 outbreak of Ebola virus and candidate agent for preventing and curing from Ebola virus.

Data from studies in nonhuman primates suggest that the triple monoclonal antibody cocktail ZMapp is a promising immune-based treatment for Ebola virus disease (EVD). Beginning in March 2015, we conducted a randomized, controlled trial of ZMapp plus the current standard of care as compared with the current standard of care alone in patients with EVD that was diagnosed in West Africa by polymerase-chain-reaction (PCR) assay. Eligible patients of any age were randomly assigned in a 1:1 ratio to receive either the current standard of care or the current standard of care plus three intravenous infusions of ZMapp (50 mg per kilogram of body weight, administered every third day). Patients were stratified according to baseline PCR cycle-threshold value for the virus (≤22 vs. >22) and country of enrollment. Oral favipiravir was part of the current standard of care in Guinea. The primary end point was mortality at 28 days. A total of 72 patients were enrolled at sites in Liberia, Sierra Leone, Guinea, and the United States. Of the 71 patients who could be evaluated, 21 died, representing an overall case fatality rate of 30%. Death occurred in 13 of 35 patients (37%) who received the current standard of care alone and in 8 of 36 patients (22%) who received the current standard of care plus ZMapp. The observed posterior probability that ZMapp plus the current standard of care was superior to the current standard of care alone was 91.2%, falling short of the prespecified threshold of 97.5%. Frequentist analyses yielded similar results (absolute difference in mortality with ZMapp, -15 percentage points; 95% confidence interval, -36 to 7). Baseline viral load was strongly predictive of both mortality and duration of hospitalization in all age groups. In this randomized, controlled trial of a putative therapeutic agent for EVD, although the estimated effect of ZMapp appeared to be beneficial, the result did not meet the prespecified statistical threshold for efficacy.

Despite the unprecedented Ebola virus outbreak response in West Africa, no Ebola medical countermeasures have been approved by the US Food and Drug Administration. However, multiple valuable lessons have been learned about the conduct of clinical research in a resource-poor, high risk-pathogen setting. Numerous therapeutics were explored or developed during the outbreak, including repurposed drugs, nucleoside and nucleotide analogues (BCX4430, brincidofovir, favipiravir, and GS-5734), nucleic acid-based drugs (TKM-Ebola and AVI-7537), and immunotherapeutics (convalescent plasma and ZMapp). We review Ebola therapeutics progress in the aftermath of the West Africa Ebola virus outbreak and attempt to offer a glimpse of a path forward.
