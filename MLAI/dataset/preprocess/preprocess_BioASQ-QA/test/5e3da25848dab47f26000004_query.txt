What rare disease is associated with a mutation in the GPC6 gene on chromosome 13?

We report on the natural history of a female with dominant omodysplasia, a rare osteochondrodysplasia with short stature, rhizomelia of the extremities (upper extremities more affected), and short first metacarpals. The proband had normal molecular analysis of the glypican 6 gene (GPC6), which was recently reported as a candidate for autosomal recessive omodysplasia. The findings in this patient were compared to other known and suspected cases of autosomal dominant omodysplasia. Mild rhizomelic shortening of the lower extremities has not been previously reported.

Glypicans are a family of glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI)-anchored, membrane-bound heparan sulfate (HS) proteoglycans. Their biological roles are only partly understood, although it is assumed that they modulate the activity of HS-binding growth factors. The involvement of glypicans in developmental morphogenesis and growth regulation has been highlighted by Drosophila mutants and by a human overgrowth syndrome with multiple malformations caused by glypican 3 mutations (Simpson-Golabi-Behmel syndrome). We now report that autosomal-recessive omodysplasia, a genetic condition characterized by short-limbed short stature, craniofacial dysmorphism, and variable developmental delay, maps to chromosome 13 (13q31.1-q32.2) and is caused by point mutations or by larger genomic rearrangements in glypican 6 (GPC6). All mutations cause truncation of the GPC6 protein and abolish both the HS-binding site and the GPI-bearing membrane-associated domain, and thus loss of function is predicted. Expression studies in microdissected mouse growth plate revealed expression of Gpc6 in proliferative chondrocytes. Thus, GPC6 seems to have a previously unsuspected role in endochondral ossification and skeletal growth, and its functional abrogation results in a short-limb phenotype.
