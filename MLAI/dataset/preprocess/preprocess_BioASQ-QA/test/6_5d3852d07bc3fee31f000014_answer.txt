IDEAL_ANSWER:
- Ty3 is preferentially inserted in genes encoding transfer RNA genes.
- The retrovirus-like element Ty3 of Saccharomyces cerevisiae integrates at the transcription initiation region of RNA polymerase III genes and is preferentially inserted in transfer RNA genes.
- Ty3 integrates within the region of RNA polymerase III transcription initiation. Thus, genomic insertions of Ty3 in a particular orientation are apparently specified by the target, while the actual position of the insertion relative to the tRNA-coding sequence can vary slightly.
- The retrovirus-like element Ty3 of Saccharomyces cerevisiae integrates at the transcription initiation region of RNA polymerase III
- The yeast transpozable element Ty3 is preferentially located in the promoter region of genes encoding ribosomal proteins.
- rna polymerase iii
- Ty3 inserts at transcription initiation sites of genomic tRNA genes and plasmid-borne 5S and U6 RNA genes transcribed by RNA polymerase III.

EXACT_ANSWER:
- the promoters of RNA PolIII-transcribed genes
