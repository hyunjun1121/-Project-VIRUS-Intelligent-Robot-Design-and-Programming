IDEAL_ANSWER:
- SignatureSearch is an R/Bioconductor package that integrates a suite of existing and novel algorithms into an analysis environment for gene expression signature (ESE) searching combined with functional enrichment analysis (FEA) and visualization methods to facilitate the interpretation of the search results.
- SignatureSearch is an R/Bioconductor package that integrates a suite of existing and novel algorithms into an analysis environment for gene expression signature (ESE) searching combined with functional enrichment analysis (FEA) and visualization methods to facilitate the interpretation of the search results. To identify which processes are predominantly modulated in the GESS results, FEA methods are combined with drug-target network visualization tools. The provided analysis tools are useful for studying the effects of genetic, chemical and environmental perturbations on biological systems, as well as searching single cell GES databases to identify novel network connections or cell types
