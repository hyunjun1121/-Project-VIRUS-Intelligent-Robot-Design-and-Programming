Mutations in the lamin A/C gene that cause Hutchinson-Gilford progeria syndrome lead to expression of a truncated, permanently farnesylated prelamin A variant called progerin. Blocking farnesylation leads to an improvement in the abnormal nuclear morphology observed in cells expressing progerin, which is associated with a re-localization of the variant protein from the nuclear envelope to the nuclear interior. We now show that a progerin construct that cannot be farnesylated is localized primarily in intranuclear foci and that its diffusional mobility is significantly greater than that of farnesylated progerin localized predominantly at the nuclear envelope. Expression of non-farnesylated progerin in transfected cells leads to a redistribution of lamin A and lamin C away from the nuclear envelope into intranuclear foci but does not significantly affect the localization of endogenous lamin B1 at nuclear envelope. There is a similar redistribution of lamin A and lamin C into intranuclear foci in transfected cells expressing progerin in which protein farnesylation is blocked by treatment with a protein farnesyltransferase inhibitor. Blocking farnesylation of progerin can lead to a redistribution of normal A-type lamins away from the inner nuclear envelope. This may have implications for using drugs that block protein prenylation to treat children with Hutchinson-Gilford progeria syndrome. These findings also provide additional evidence that A-type and B-type lamins can form separate microdomains within the nucleus.

Mutations in the lamin A/C (LMNA) gene that cause Hutchinson-Gilford progeria syndrome (HGPS) lead to expression of a protein called progerin with 50 amino acids deleted from the tail of prelamin A. In cells from patients with HGPS, both the amount and distribution of heterochromatin are altered. We designed in vitro assays to ask whether such alterations might reflect changes in chromatin, DNA and/or histone binding properties of progerin compared to wild-type lamin C-terminal tails. We show that progerin tail has a reduced DNA/chromatin binding capacity and modified trimethylated H3K27 binding pattern, offering a molecular mechanism for heterochromatin alterations related to HGPS.

Lamins are important constituents of the nuclear inner membrane and provide a platform for transcription factors and chromatin. Progerin, a C-terminal truncated lamin A mutant, causes premature aging termed Hutchinson-Gilford Progeria Syndrome (HGPS). Oxidative stress appears to be involved in the pathogenesis of HGPS, although the mechanistic role of progerin remains elusive. Here we examined whether nuclear lamins are important for a cellular antioxidant mechanism, and whether progerin compromises it. We investigated the activation of nuclear factor-E2-related factor 2 (Nrf2) which regulates various antioxidant genes including heme oxygenase-1 (HMOX1), following exposure to sodium arsenite or cadmium chloride in lamin knockdown human cell lines and primary HGPS human fibroblasts. Knocking down lamin A/C, or B, or all nuclear lamins simultaneously in three human cell lines (HaCaT, SW480, and K562) did not impair arsenite- or cadmium-induced activation of Nrf2. Progerin-expressing human primary HGPS fibroblasts showed lower basal levels of HMOX1 and NQO1 expression; however, in response to arsenic stress both normal and HGPS primary fibroblasts showed Nrf2 nuclear accumulation along with upregulation and phosphorylation of p62/SQSTM1 at Ser351, downregulation of Keap1, and comparable expression of an array of downstream Nrf2-regulated antioxidant genes. We also observed new forms of cleaved lamin A, B1 and B2 induced by cadmium stress although their roles in the Nrf2 antioxidant system need further investigation. These results suggest that the nuclear lamins and progerin have marginal roles in the activation of the antioxidant Nrf2 response to arsenic and cadmium.

Hutchinson-Gilford progeria syndrome (HGPS) is a premature aging disorder characterized by accelerated cardiovascular disease with extensive fibrosis. It is caused by a mutation in LMNA leading to expression of truncated prelamin A (progerin) in the nucleus. To investigate the contribution of the endothelium to cardiovascular HGPS pathology, we generated an endothelium-specific HGPS mouse model with selective endothelial progerin expression. Transgenic mice develop interstitial myocardial and perivascular fibrosis and left ventricular hypertrophy associated with diastolic dysfunction and premature death. Endothelial cells show impaired shear stress response and reduced levels of endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS) and NO. On the molecular level, progerin impairs nucleocytoskeletal coupling in endothelial cells through changes in mechanoresponsive components at the nuclear envelope, increased F-actin/G-actin ratios, and deregulation of mechanoresponsive myocardin-related transcription factor-A (MRTFA). MRTFA binds to the Nos3 promoter and reduces eNOS expression, thereby mediating a profibrotic paracrine response in fibroblasts. MRTFA inhibition rescues eNOS levels and ameliorates the profibrotic effect of endothelial cells in vitro. Although this murine model lacks the key anatomical feature of vascular smooth muscle cell loss seen in HGPS patients, our data show that progerin-induced impairment of mechanosignaling in endothelial cells contributes to excessive fibrosis and cardiovascular disease in HGPS patients.

Hutchinson-Gilford progeria syndrome (HGPS, OMIM 176670) is a rare disorder characterized by segmental accelerated aging and early death from coronary artery disease or stroke. Nearly 90% of HGPS sufferers carry a G608G mutation within exon 11 of LMNA, producing a truncated form of prelamin A, referred to as "progerin". Here, we report the isolation of naïve multipotent skin-derived precursor (SKP) cells from dermal fibroblast cultures from HGPS donors. These cells form spheres and express the neural crest marker, nestin, in addition to the multipotent markers, OCT4, Sox2, Nanog and TG30; these cells can self-renew and differentiate into smooth muscle cells (SMCs) and fibroblasts. The SMCs derived from the HGPS-SKPs accumulate nuclear progerin with increasing passages. A subset of the HGPS-naïve SKPs express progerin in vitro and in situ in HGPS skin sections. This is the first in vivo evidence that progerin is produced in adult stem cells, and implies that this protein could induce stem cells exhaustion as a mechanism contributing to aging. Our study provides a basis on which to explore therapeutic applications for HGPS stem cells and opens avenues for investigating the pathogenesis of other genetic diseases.

Progerin is a truncated form of lamin A. It is identified in patients with Hutchinson-Gilford progeria syndrome (HGPS), a disease characterized by accelerated aging. The contribution of progerin toward aging has been shown to be related to increased DNA damages. Since aging is one major risk factor for carcinogenesis, and genomic instability is a hallmark of malignant cancers, we investigated the expression of progerin in human cancer cells, and whether its expression contributes to carcinogenesis. Using RT-PCR and Western blotting, we detected the expression of progerin in prostate PC-3, DU145 and LNCaP cells at mRNA and protein levels. Ectopic progerin expression did not cause cellular senescence in PC-3 or MCF7 cells. PC-3 cells progerin transfectants were sensitized to DNA damage agent camptothecin (CPT); and persistent DNA damage responses were observed, which might be caused by progerin induced defective DNA damage repair. In addition, progerin transfectants were more tumorigenic in vivo than vector control cells. Our study for the first time describes the expression of progerin in a number of human cancer cell lines and its contributory role in tumorigenesis.

In the last decade, we have seen increasing evidence of the importance of structural nuclear proteins such as lamins in nuclear architecture and compartmentalization of genome function and in the maintenance of mechanical stability and genome integrity. With over 400 mutations identified in the LMNA gene (encoding for A-type lamins) associated with more than ten distinct degenerative disorders, the role of lamins as genome caretakers and the contribution of lamins dysfunction to disease are unarguable. However, the molecular mechanisms whereby lamins mutations cause pathologies remain less understood. Here, we review pathways and mechanisms recently identified as playing a role in the pathophysiology of laminopathies, with special emphasis in Hutchinson Gilford Progeria Syndrome (HGPS). This devastating incurable accelerated aging disease is caused by a silent mutation in the LMNA gene that generates a truncated lamin A protein "progerin" that exerts profound cellular toxicity and organismal decline. Patients usually die in their teens due to cardiovascular complications such as myocardial infarction or stroke. To date, there are no efficient therapies that ameliorate disease progression, stressing the need to understand molecularly disease mechanisms that can be targeted therapeutically. We will summarize data supporting that replication stress is a major cause of genomic instability in laminopathies, which contributes to the activation of innate immune responses to self-DNA that in turn accelerate the aging process.

Anti-ageing products are of a great importance in cosmetic fields. However, even if numerous strategies have been proposed to fight against skin ageing or to minimize its aesthetic impact since the beginning of the 'scientific cosmetology' era, the products basing their efficacy on the observation of pathological situations are rare. The most obvious pathology linked to the ageing of skin (notably) consists in the Hutchinson-Gilford Progeria Syndrome (HGPS), a rare disorder characterized by accelerated ageing and early death. In this disease the lamin A, a protein participating (with others lamins) in the formation of the nuclear lamina and implicated in nuclear stability, chromatin structure and gene expression, is present in a truncated version called progerin. In this study, we have examined the lactate and the progerin production of human normal cutaneous cells issued from subjects of different ages. Using a sensitive and specific progerin ELISA assay developed in house, we so provide the first quantitative demonstration of an increased progerin expression and lactate production in skin during ageing. Moreover, we have also demonstrated that in the selected experimental conditions, it was possible to down-regulate the progerin production of aged cells by using an algae extract. As this extract, an Alaria esculenta extract, could be used in cosmetic formulations, we suggest that a better understanding of the skin pathologies could be a useful tool in developing efficient active compounds, attractive for but not limited to cosmetic purposes.

Hutchinson-Gilford progeria syndrome (HGPS) is a rare genetic disorder that is characterized by dramatic premature aging and accelerated cardiovascular disease. HGPS is almost always caused by a de novo point mutation in the lamin A gene (LMNA) that activates a cryptic splice donor site, producing a truncated mutant protein termed "progerin." WT prelamin A is anchored to the nuclear envelope by a farnesyl isoprenoid lipid. Cleavage of the terminal 15 aa and the farnesyl group releases mature lamin A from this tether. In contrast, this cleavage site is deleted in progerin. We hypothesized that retention of the farnesyl group causes progerin to become permanently anchored in the nuclear membrane, disrupting proper nuclear scaffolding and causing the characteristic nuclear blebbing seen in HGPS cells. Also, we hypothesized that blocking farnesylation would decrease progerin toxicity. To test this hypothesis, the terminal CSIM sequence in progerin was mutated to SSIM, a sequence that cannot be farnesylated. SSIM progerin relocalized from the nuclear periphery into nucleoplasmic aggregates and produced no nuclear blebbing. Also, blocking farnesylation of authentic progerin in transiently transfected HeLa, HEK 293, and NIH 3T3 cells with farnesyltransferase inhibitors (FTIs) restored normal nuclear architecture. Last, treatment of both early- and late-passage human HGPS fibroblasts with FTIs resulted in significant reductions in nuclear blebbing. Our results suggest that treatment with FTIs represents a potential therapy for patients with HGPS.

Hutchinson-Gilford progeria syndrome (HGPS) is a rare genetic disorder because of a LMNA gene mutation that produces a mutant lamin A protein (progerin). Progerin also has been correlated to physiological aging and related diseases. However, how progerin causes the progeria remains unknown. Here, we report that the large subunit (RFC1) of replication factor C is cleaved in HGPS cells, leading to the production of a truncated RFC1 of ~ 75 kDa, which appears to be defective in loading proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA) and pol δ onto DNA for replication. Interestingly, the cleavage can be inhibited by a serine protease inhibitor, suggesting that RFC1 is cleaved by a serine protease. Because of the crucial role of RFC in DNA replication, our findings provide a mechanistic interpretation for the observed early replicative arrest and premature aging phenotypes of HPGS and may lead to novel strategies in HGPS treatment. Furthermore, this unique truncated form of RFC1 may serve as a potential marker for HGPS.

Hutchinson-Gilford progeria syndrome is a disorder of premature aging in children caused by de novo mutations in <i>LMNA</i> that lead to the synthesis of an internally truncated form of prelamin A (commonly called progerin). The production of progerin causes multiple disease phenotypes, including an unusual vascular phenotype characterized by the loss of smooth muscle cells in the arterial media and fibrosis of the adventitia. We show that progerin expression, combined with mechanical stress, promotes smooth muscle cell death. Disrupting the linker of the nucleoskeleton and cytoskeleton (LINC) complex in smooth muscle cells ameliorates the toxic effects of progerin on smooth muscle cells and limits the accompanying adventitial fibrosis.

Hutchinson Gilford progeria syndrome (HGPS) is a devastating accelerated aging disease caused by LMNA gene mutation. The truncated lamin A protein produced "progerin" has a dominant toxic effect in cells, causing disruption of nuclear architecture and chromatin structure, genomic instability, gene expression changes, oxidative stress, and premature senescence. It was previously shown that progerin-induced genomic instability involves replication stress (RS), characterized by replication fork stalling and nuclease-mediated degradation of stalled forks. RS is accompanied by activation of cGAS/STING cytosolic DNA sensing pathway and STAT1-regulated interferon (IFN)-like response. It is also found that calcitriol, the active hormonal form of vitamin D, rescues RS and represses the cGAS/STING/IFN cascade. Here, the mechanisms underlying RS in progerin-expressing cells and the rescue by calcitriol are explored. It is found that progerin elicits a marked downregulation of RAD51, concomitant with increased levels of phosphorylated-RPA, a marker of RS. Interestingly, calcitriol prevents RS and activation of the cGAS/STING/IFN response in part through maintenance of RAD51 levels in progerin-expressing cells. Thus, loss of RAD51 is one of the consequences of progerin expression that can contribute to RS and activation of the IFN response. Stabilization of RAD51 helps explain the beneficial effects of calcitriol in these processes.

Hutchinson-Gilford progeria syndrome (HGPS, OMIM 176670) is a rare multisystem childhood premature aging disorder linked to mutations in the LMNA gene. The most common HGPS mutation is found at position G608G within exon 11 of the LMNA gene. This mutation results in the deletion of 50 amino acids at the carboxyl-terminal tail of prelamin A, and the truncated protein is called progerin. Progerin only undergoes a subset of the normal post-translational modifications and remains permanently farnesylated. Several attempts to rescue the normal cellular phenotype with farnesyltransferase inhibitors (FTIs) and other compounds have resulted in partial cellular recovery. Using proteomics, we report here that progerin induces changes in the composition of the HGPS nuclear proteome, including alterations to several components of the protein degradation pathways. Consequently, proteasome activity and autophagy are impaired in HGPS cells. To restore protein clearance in HGPS cells, we treated HGPS cultures with sulforaphane (SFN), an antioxidant derived from cruciferous vegetables. We determined that SFN stimulates proteasome activity and autophagy in normal and HGPS fibroblast cultures. Specifically, SFN enhances progerin clearance by autophagy and reverses the phenotypic changes that are the hallmarks of HGPS. Therefore, SFN is a promising therapeutic avenue for children with HGPS.

Hutchinson-Gilford progeria syndrome (HGPS) is a rare premature aging disorder notably characterized by precocious and deadly atherosclerosis. Almost 90% of HGPS patients carry a LMNA p.G608G splice variant that leads to the expression of a permanently farnesylated abnormal form of prelamin-A, referred to as progerin. Endothelial dysfunction is a key determinant of atherosclerosis, notably during aging. Previous studies have shown that progerin accumulates in HGPS patients' endothelial cells but also during vascular physiological aging. However, whether progerin expression in human endothelial cells can recapitulate features of endothelial dysfunction is currently unknown. Herein, we evaluated the direct impact of exogenously expressed progerin and wild-type lamin-A on human endothelial cell function and senescence. Our data demonstrate that progerin, but not wild-type lamin-A, overexpression induces endothelial cell dysfunction, characterized by increased inflammation and oxidative stress together with persistent DNA damage, increased cell cycle arrest protein expression and cellular senescence. Inhibition of progerin prenylation using a pravastatin-zoledronate combination partly prevents these defects. Our data suggest a direct proatherogenic role of progerin in human endothelial cells, which could contribute to HGPS-associated early atherosclerosis and also potentially be involved in physiological endothelial aging participating to age-related cardiometabolic diseases.

Hutchinson-Gilford progeria syndrome (HGPS) is a premature aging disorder, caused by mutation in the gene encoding lamin A/C, which produces a truncated protein called progerin. In cells from HGPS patients, progerin accumulates at the nuclear membrane (NM), where it causes NM deformations. In this study, we investigated whether progerin-induced NM deformation involved ESCRT-III, a protein complex that remodels nuclear and cytoplasmic membranes. The ESCRT-III protein CHMP4B was recruited to sites of aberrant NM proliferation in human cells ectopically expressing progerin and in patient-derived HGPS fibroblasts. Derepression of NM deformation in these cells was observed following depletion of CHMP4B or an ESCRT-III adaptor, ALIX. Treatment with rapamycin (which induce autophagic clearance of progerin and reverse progerin-induced cellular phenotypes) down-regulated progerin-induced NM deformation, whereas treatment with bafilomycin A1 (an inhibitor of autophagy and lysosome-based degradation) or CHMP4B depletion antagonized the effects of rapamycin. These results indicate that the ALIX-mediated ESCRT-III pathway plays a suppressive role in progerin-induced NM deformation and suggest that autophagy down-regulates progerin-induced NM deformation in a manner dependent on ESCRT-III machinery.

Farnesylated prelamin A is a processing intermediate produced in the lamin A maturation pathway. Accumulation of a truncated farnesylated prelamin A form, called progerin, is a hallmark of the severe premature ageing syndrome, Hutchinson-Gilford progeria. Progerin elicits toxic effects in cells, leading to chromatin damage and cellular senescence and ultimately causes skin and endothelial defects, bone resorption, lipodystrophy and accelerated ageing. Knowledge of the mechanism underlying prelamin A turnover is critical for the development of clinically effective protein inhibitors that can avoid accumulation to toxic levels without impairing lamin A/C expression, which is essential for normal biological functions. Little is known about specific molecules that may target farnesylated prelamin A to elicit protein degradation. Here, we report the discovery of rapamycin as a novel inhibitor of progerin, which dramatically and selectively decreases protein levels through a mechanism involving autophagic degradation. Rapamycin treatment of progeria cells lowers progerin, as well as wild-type prelamin A levels, and rescues the chromatin phenotype of cultured fibroblasts, including histone methylation status and BAF and LAP2alpha distribution patterns. Importantly, rapamycin treatment does not affect lamin C protein levels, but increases the relative expression of the prelamin A endoprotease ZMPSTE24. Thus, rapamycin, an antibiotic belonging to the class of macrolides, previously found to increase longevity in mouse models, can serve as a therapeutic tool, to eliminate progerin, avoid farnesylated prelamin A accumulation, and restore chromatin dynamics in progeroid laminopathies.

Mutations in lamin A (LMNA) are responsible for a variety of human dystrophic and metabolic diseases. Here, we created a mouse model in which progerin, the lamin A mutant protein that causes Hutchinson-Gilford progeria syndrome (HGPS), can be inducibly overexpressed. Muscle-specific overexpression of progerin was sufficient to induce muscular dystrophy and alter whole-body energy expenditure, leading to premature death. Intriguingly, sarcolipin (Sln), an endoplasmic reticulum (ER)-associated protein involved in heat production, is upregulated in progerin-expressing and Lmna knockout (Lmna<sup>-/-</sup> ) skeletal muscle. The depletion of Sln accelerated the early death of Lmna<sup>-/-</sup> mice. An examination at the molecular level revealed that progerin recruits Sln and Calnexin to the nuclear periphery. Furthermore, progerin-expressing myoblasts presented enhanced store-operated Ca<sup>2+</sup> entry, as well as increased co-localization of STIM1 and ORAI1. These findings suggest that progerin dysregulates calcium homeostasis through an interaction with a subset of ER-associated proteins, resulting in thermogenic and metabolic abnormalities.

Hutchinson-Gilford progeria syndrome (HGPS) is caused by the production of a truncated prelamin A, called progerin, which is farnesylated at its carboxyl terminus. Progerin is targeted to the nuclear envelope and causes misshapen nuclei. Protein farnesyltransferase inhibitors (FTI) mislocalize progerin away from the nuclear envelope and reduce the frequency of misshapen nuclei. To determine whether an FTI would ameliorate disease phenotypes in vivo, we created gene-targeted mice with an HGPS mutation (LmnaHG/+) and then examined the effect of an FTI on disease phenotypes. LmnaHG/+ mice exhibited phenotypes similar to those in human HGPS patients, including retarded growth, reduced amounts of adipose tissue, micrognathia, osteoporosis, and osteolytic lesions in bone. Osteolytic lesions in the ribs led to spontaneous bone fractures. Treatment with an FTI increased adipose tissue mass, improved body weight curves, reduced the number of rib fractures, and improved bone mineralization and bone cortical thickness. These studies suggest that FTIs could be useful for treating humans with HGPS.

Neurons in the brain produce lamin C but almost no lamin A, a consequence of the removal of prelamin A transcripts by miR-9, a brain-specific microRNA. We have proposed that miR-9-mediated regulation of prelamin A in the brain could explain the absence of primary neurological disease in Hutchinson-Gilford progeria syndrome, a genetic disease caused by the synthesis of an internally truncated form of farnesyl-prelamin A (progerin). This explanation makes sense, but it is not entirely satisfying because it is unclear whether progerin-even if were expressed in neurons-would be capable of eliciting neuropathology. To address that issue, we created a new Lmna knock-in allele, Lmna(HG-C), which produces progerin transcripts lacking an miR-9 binding site. Mice harboring the Lmna(HG-C) allele produced progerin in neurons, but they had no pathology in the central nervous system. However, these mice invariably developed esophageal achalasia, and the enteric neurons and nerve fibers in gastrointestinal tract were markedly abnormal. The same disorder, achalasia, was observed in genetically modified mice that express full-length farnesyl-prelamin A in neurons (Zmpste24-deficient mice carrying two copies of a Lmna knock-in allele yielding full-length prelamin A transcripts lacking a miR-9 binding site). Our findings indicate that progerin and full-length farnesyl-prelamin A are toxic to neurons of the enteric nervous system.

Hutchinson-Gilford progeria syndrome (HGPS) is a progeroid disease characterized by the early onset of age-related phenotypes including arthritis, loss of body fat and hair, and atherosclerosis. Cells from affected individuals express a mutant version of the nuclear envelope protein lamin A (termed progerin) and have previously been shown to exhibit prominent histone modification changes. Here, we analyze the possibility that epigenetic deregulation of lamina-associated domains (LADs) is involved in the molecular pathology of HGPS. To do so, we studied chromatin accessibility (Assay for Transposase-accessible Chromatin (ATAC)-see/-seq), DNA methylation profiles (Infinium MethylationEPIC BeadChips), and transcriptomes (RNA-seq) of nine primary HGPS fibroblast cell lines and six additional controls, two parental and four age-matched healthy fibroblast cell lines. Our ATAC-see/-seq data demonstrate that primary dermal fibroblasts from HGPS patients exhibit chromatin accessibility changes that are enriched in LADs. Infinium MethylationEPIC BeadChip profiling further reveals that DNA methylation alterations observed in HGPS fibroblasts are similarly enriched in LADs and different from those occurring during healthy aging and Werner syndrome (WS), another premature aging disease. Moreover, HGPS patients can be stratified into two different subgroups according to their DNA methylation profiles. Finally, we show that the epigenetic deregulation of LADs is associated with HGPS-specific gene expression changes. Taken together, our results strongly implicate epigenetic deregulation of LADs as an important and previously unrecognized feature of HGPS, which contributes to disease-specific gene expression. Therefore, they not only add a new layer to the study of epigenetic changes in the progeroid syndrome, but also advance our understanding of the disease's pathology at the cellular level.

Mutations in the LMNA gene are a common cause (6-8%) of dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM) leading to heart failure, a growing health care problem worldwide. The premature aging disease Hutchinson-Gilford syndrome (HGPS) is also caused by defined mutations in the LMNA gene resulting in activation of a cryptic splice donor site leading to a defective truncated prelamin A protein called progerin. Low levels of progerin are expressed in healthy individuals associated with ageing. Here, we aimed to address the role of progerin in dilated cardiomyopathy. mRNA expression of progerin was analyzed in heart tissue of DCM (n = 15) and non-failing hearts (n = 10) as control and in blood samples from patients with DCM (n = 56) and healthy controls (n = 10). Sequencing confirmed the expression of progerin mRNA in the human heart. Progerin mRNA levels derived from DCM hearts were significantly upregulated compared to controls (1.27 ± 0.42 vs. 0.81 ± 0.24; p = 0.005). In contrast, progerin mRNA levels in whole blood cells were not significantly different in DCM patients compared to controls. Linear regression analyses revealed that progerin mRNA in the heart is significantly negatively correlated to ejection fraction (r = -0.567, p = 0.003) and positively correlated to left ventricular enddiastolic diameter (r = 0.551, p = 0.004) but not with age of the heart per se. Progerin mRNA levels were not influenced by inflammation in DCM hearts. Immunohistochemistry and Immunofluorescence analysis confirmed increased expression of progerin protein in cell nuclei of DCM hearts associated with increased TUNEL+ apoptotic cells. Our data suggest that progerin is upregulated in human DCM hearts and strongly correlates with left ventricular remodeling. Progerin might be involved in progression of heart failure and myocardial aging.

Hutchinson-Gilford progeria syndrome (HGPS, OMIM 176670) is a rare premature aging disorder that leads to death at an average age of 14.7 years due to myocardial infarction or stroke. The most common mutation in HGPS is at position G608G (GGC>GGT) within exon 11 of the LMNA gene. This mutation results in the deletion of 50 amino acids at the carboxyl-terminal tail of prelamin A, producing a truncated farnesylated protein called progerin. Lamins play important roles in the organization and structure of the nucleus. The nuclear build-up of progerin causes severe morphological and functional changes in interphase HGPS cells. In this study, we investigated whether progerin elicits spatiotemporal deviations in mitotic processes in HGPS fibroblasts. We analyzed the nuclear distribution of endogenous progerin during mitosis in relation to components of the nuclear lamina, nuclear envelope (NE) and nuclear pores. We found that progerin caused defects in chromosome segregation as early as metaphase, delayed NE reformation and trapped lamina components and inner NE proteins in the endoplasmic reticulum at the end of mitosis. Progerin displaced the centromere protein F (CENP-F) from metaphase chromosome kinetochores, which caused increased chromatin lagging, binucleated cells and genomic instability. This accumulation of progerin-dependent defects with each round of mitosis predisposes cells to premature senescence.

Hutchinson-Gilford progeria syndrome (HGPS) is a rare laminopathy that produces a mutant form of prelamin A, known as Progerin, resulting in premature aging. HGPS cells show morphological abnormalities of the nuclear membrane, reduced cell proliferation rates, accumulation of reactive oxygen species (ROS), and expression of senescence markers. Lysophosphatidic acid (LPA) is a growth factor-like lipid mediator that regulates various physiological functions via activating multiple LPA G protein-coupled receptors. Here, we study the roles of LPA and LPA receptors in premature aging. We report that the protein level of LPA<sub>3</sub> was highly downregulated through internalization and the lysosomal degradation pathway in Progerin-transfected HEK293 cells. By treating Progerin HEK293 cells with an LPA<sub>3</sub> agonist (OMPT, 1-Oleoyl-2-O-methyl-rac-glycerophosphothionate) and performing shRNA knockdown of the Lpa3r transcript in these cells, we showed that LPA<sub>3</sub> activation increased expression levels of antioxidant enzymes, consequently inhibiting ROS accumulation and ameliorating cell senescence. LPA<sub>3</sub> was shown to be downregulated in HGPS patient fibroblasts through the lysosomal pathway, and it was shown to be crucial for ameliorating ROS accumulation and cell senescence in fibroblasts. Moreover, in a zebrafish model, LPA<sub>3</sub> deficiency was sufficient to cause premature aging phenotypes in multiple organs, as well as a shorter lifespan. Taken together, these findings identify the decline of LPA<sub>3</sub> as a key contributor to the premature aging phenotypes of HGPS cells and zebrafish.

We sought to use splice-switching antisense oligonucleotides to produce a model of accelerated ageing by enhancing expression of progerin, translated from a mis-spliced lamin A gene (LMNA) transcript in human myogenic cells. The progerin transcript (LMNA Δ150) lacks the last 150 bases of exon 11, and is translated into a truncated protein associated with the severe premature ageing disease, Hutchinson-Gilford progeria syndrome (HGPS). HGPS arises from de novo mutations that activate a cryptic splice site in exon 11 of LMNA and result in progerin accumulation in tissues of mesodermal origin. Progerin has also been proposed to play a role in the 'natural' ageing process in tissues. We sought to test this hypothesis by producing a model of accelerated muscle ageing in human myogenic cells. A panel of splice-switching antisense oligonucleotides were designed to anneal across exon 11 of the LMNA pre-mRNA, and these compounds were transfected into primary human myogenic cells. RT-PCR showed that the majority of oligonucleotides were able to modify LMNA transcript processing. Oligonucleotides that annealed within the 150 base region of exon 11 that is missing in the progerin transcript, as well as those that targeted the normal exon 11 donor site induced the LMNA Δ150 transcript, but most oligonucleotides also generated variable levels of LMNA transcript missing the entire exon 11. Upon evaluation of different oligomer chemistries, the morpholino phosphorodiamidate oligonucleotides were found to be more efficient than the equivalent sequences prepared as oligonucleotides with 2'-O-methyl modified bases on a phosphorothioate backbone. The morpholino oligonucleotides induced nuclear localised progerin, demonstrated by immunostaining, and morphological nuclear changes typical of HGPS cells. We show that it is possible to induce progerin expression in myogenic cells using splice-switching oligonucleotides to redirect splicing of LMNA. This may offer a model to investigate the role of progerin in premature muscle ageing.

Hutchinson-Gilford progeria syndrome (HGPS), commonly called progeria, is an extremely rare disorder that affects only one child per four million births. It is characterized by accelerated aging in affected individuals leading to premature death at an average age of 14.5 years due to cardiovascular complications. The main cause of HGPS is a sporadic autosomal dominant point mutation in LMNA gene resulting in differently spliced lamin A protein known as progerin. Accumulation of progerin under nuclear lamina and activation of its downstream effectors cause perturbation in cellular morphology and physiology which leads to a systemic disorder that mainly impairs the cardiovascular system, bones, skin, and overall growth. Till now, no cure has been found for this catastrophic disorder; however, several therapeutic strategies are under development. The current review focuses on the overall progress in the field of therapeutic approaches for the management/cure of HGPS. We have also discussed the new disease models that have been developed for the study of this rare disorder. Moreover, we have highlighted the therapeutic application of extracellular vesicles derived from stem cells against aging and aging-related disorders and, therefore, suggest the same for the treatment of HGPS.

Reprogramming somatic cells to induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) resets their identity back to an embryonic age and, thus, presents a significant hurdle for modeling late-onset disorders. In this study, we describe a strategy for inducing aging-related features in human iPSC-derived lineages and apply it to the modeling of Parkinson's disease (PD). Our approach involves expression of progerin, a truncated form of lamin A associated with premature aging. We found that expression of progerin in iPSC-derived fibroblasts and neurons induces multiple aging-related markers and characteristics, including dopamine-specific phenotypes such as neuromelanin accumulation. Induced aging in PD iPSC-derived dopamine neurons revealed disease phenotypes that require both aging and genetic susceptibility, such as pronounced dendrite degeneration, progressive loss of tyrosine hydroxylase (TH) expression, and enlarged mitochondria or Lewy-body-precursor inclusions. Thus, our study suggests that progerin-induced aging can be used to reveal late-onset age-related disease features in hiPSC-based disease models.
