The type II iodothyronine deiodinase (D2) is a type I endoplasmic reticulum (ER)-resident thioredoxin fold-containing selenoprotein that activates thyroid hormone. D2 is inactivated by ER-associated ubiquitination and can be reactivated by two ubiquitin-specific peptidase-class D2-interacting deubiquitinases (DUBs). Here, we used D2-expressing cell models to define that D2 ubiquitination (UbD2) occurs via K48-linked ubiquitin chains and that exposure to its natural substrate, T4, accelerates UbD2 formation and retrotranslocation to the cytoplasm via interaction with the p97-ATPase complex. D2 retrotranslocation also includes deubiquitination by the p97-associated DUB Ataxin-3 (Atx3). Inhibiting Atx3 with eeyarestatin-I did not affect D2:p97 binding but decreased UbD2 retrotranslocation and caused ER accumulation of high-molecular weight UbD2 bands possibly by interfering with the D2-ubiquitin-specific peptidases binding. Once in the cytosol, D2 is delivered to the proteasomes as evidenced by coprecipitation with 19S proteasome subunit S5a and increased colocalization with the 20S proteasome. We conclude that interaction between UbD2 and p97/Atx3 mediates retranslocation of UbD2 to the cytoplasm for terminal degradation in the proteasomes, a pathway that is accelerated by exposure to T4.

Ubiquitination is essential for the regulation of cellular protein homeostasis. It also has a central role in numerous signaling events. Recent advances in the production and availability of antibodies that recognize the Lys-ɛ-Gly-Gly (K-ɛ-GG) remnant produced by trypsin digestion of proteins having ubiquitinated lysine side chains have markedly improved the ability to enrich and detect endogenous ubiquitination sites by mass spectrometry (MS). The following protocol describes the steps required to complete a large-scale ubiquitin experiment for the detection of tens of thousands of distinct ubiquitination sites from cell lines or tissue samples. Specifically, we present detailed, step-by-step instructions for sample preparation, off-line fractionation by reversed-phase chromatography at pH 10, immobilization of an antibody specific to K-ɛ-GG to beads by chemical cross-linking, enrichment of ubiquitinated peptides using these antibodies and proteomic analysis of enriched samples by LC-tandem MS (MS/MS). Relative quantification can be achieved by performing stable isotope labeling by amino acids in cell culture (SILAC) labeling of cells. After cell or tissue samples have been prepared for lysis, the described protocol can be completed in ∼5 d.

Ubiquitination is a process that involves the covalent attachment of the 76-residue ubiquitin protein through its C-terminal di-glycine (GG) to lysine (K) residues on substrate proteins. This post-translational modification elicits a wide range of functional consequences including targeting proteins for proteasomal degradation, altering subcellular trafficking events, and facilitating protein-protein interactions. A number of methods exist for identifying the sites of ubiquitination on proteins of interest, including site-directed mutagenesis and affinity-purification mass spectrometry (AP-MS). Recent publications have also highlighted the use of peptide-level immunoaffinity enrichment of K-GG modified peptides from whole cell lysates for global characterization of ubiquitination sites. Here we investigated the utility of this technique for focused mapping of ubiquitination sites on individual proteins. For a series of membrane-associated and cytoplasmic substrates including erbB-2 (HER2), Dishevelled-2 (DVL2), and T cell receptor α (TCRα), we observed that K-GG peptide immunoaffinity enrichment consistently yielded additional ubiquitination sites beyond those identified in protein level AP-MS experiments. To assess this quantitatively, SILAC-labeled lysates were prepared and used to compare the abundances of individual K-GG peptides from samples prepared in parallel. Consistently, K-GG peptide immunoaffinity enrichment yielded greater than fourfold higher levels of modified peptides than AP-MS approaches. Using this approach, we went on to characterize inducible ubiquitination on multiple members of the T-cell receptor complex that are functionally affected by endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress. Together, these data demonstrate the utility of immunoaffinity peptide enrichment for single protein ubiquitination site analysis and provide insights into the ubiquitination of HER2, DVL2, and proteins in the T-cell receptor complex.

The lysyl oxidase gene inhibits Ras signaling in transformed fibroblasts and breast cancer cells. Its activity was mapped to the 162 amino acid propeptide domain (LOX-PP) of the lysyl oxidase precursor protein. LOX-PP inhibited the Her-2/Ras signaling axis in breast cancer cells, and reduced the Her-2-driven breast tumor burden in a xenograft model. Since its mechanism of action is largely unknown, co-affinity-purification/mass spectrometry was performed and the "Cbl-interacting protein of 85-kDa" (CIN85) identified as an associating protein. CIN85 is an SH3-containing adapter protein that is overexpressed in invasive breast cancers. The CIN85 SH3 domains interact with c-Cbl, an E3 ubiquitin ligase, via an unconventional PxxxPR ligand sequence, with the highest affinity displayed by the SH3-B domain. Interaction with CIN85 recruits c-Cbl to the AMAP1 complex where its ubiquitination activity is necessary for cancer cells to develop an invasive phenotype and to degrade the matrix. Direct interaction of LOX-PP with CIN85 was confirmed using co-immunoprecipitation analysis of lysates from breast cancer cells and of purified expressed proteins. CIN85 interaction with c-Cbl was reduced by LOX-PP. Domain specific CIN85 regions and deletion mutants of LOX-PP were prepared and used to map the sites of interaction to the SH3-B domain of CIN85 and to an epitope encompassing amino acids 111 to 116 of LOX-PP. Specific LOX-PP point mutant proteins P111A and R116A failed to interact with CIN85 or to compete for CIN85 binding with c-Cbl. Structural modeling identified a new atypical PxpxxRh SH3-binding motif in this region of LOX-PP. The LOX-PP interaction with CIN85 was shown to reduce the invasive phenotype of breast cancer cells, including their ability to degrade the surrounding extracellular matrix and for Matrigel outgrowth. Thus, LOX-PP interacts with CIN85 via a novel SH3-binding motif and this association reduces CIN85-promoted invasion by breast cancer cells.

Protein ubiquitination occurs through formation of an isopeptide bond between the C-terminal glycine of ubiquitin (Ub) and the ɛ-amino group of a substrate lysine residue. This post-translational modification, which occurs through the attachment of single and/or multiple copies of mono-ubiquitin and poly-ubiquitin chains, is involved in crucial cellular events such as protein degradation, cell-cycle regulation and DNA repair. The abnormal functioning of ubiquitin pathways is also implicated in the pathogenesis of several human diseases ranging from cancer to neurodegeneration. However, despite the undoubted biological importance, understanding the molecular basis of how ubiquitination regulates different pathways has up to now been strongly limited by the difficulty of producing the amounts of highly homogeneous samples that are needed for a structural characterization by X-ray crystallography and/or NMR. Here, we report on the production of milligrams of highly pure Josephin mono-ubiquitinated on lysine 117 through large scale in vitro enzymatic ubiquitination. Josephin is the catalytic domain of ataxin-3, a protein responsible for spinocerebellar ataxia type 3. Ataxin-3 is the first deubiquitinating enzyme (DUB) reported to be activated by mono-ubiquitination. We demonstrate that the samples produced with the described method are correctly folded and suitable for structural studies. The protocol allows facile selective labelling of the components. Our results provide an important proof-of-concept that may pave the way to new approaches to the in vitro study of ubiquitinated proteins.

The quantitation of lysine post-translational modifications (PTMs) by bottom-up mass spectrometry is convoluted by the need for analogous derivatives and the production of different tryptic peptides from the unmodified and modified versions of a protein. Chemical derivatization of lysines prior to enzymatic digestion circumvents these problems and has proven to be a successful method for lysine PTM quantitation. The most notable example is the use of deuteroacetylation to quantitate lysine acetylation. In this work, levels of lysine ubiquitination were quantitated using a structurally homologous label that is chemically similar to the diglycine (GlyGly) tag, which is left at the ubiquitination site upon trypsinolysis. The LC-MS analysis of a chemically equivalent monoglycine (Gly) tag that is analogous to the corresponding GlyGly tag proved that the monoglycine tag can be used for the quantitation of ubiquitination. A glycinylation protocol was then established for the derivatization of proteins to label unmodified lysine residues with a single glycine tag. Ubiquitin multimers were used to show that after glycinylation and tryptic digestion, the mass spectrometric response from the corresponding analogous tagged peptides could be compared for relative quantitation. For a proof of principle regarding the applicability of this technique to the analysis of ubiquitination in biological samples, the glycinylation technique was used to quantitate the increase in monoubiquitinated histone H2B that is observed in yeast which lacks the enzyme responsible for deubiquitinating H2B-K123, compared to wild-type yeast.

Eukaryotic initiation factor 2Bε (eIF2Bε) plays a critical role in the initiation of mRNA translation and its expression and guanine nucleotide exchange activity are major determinants of the rate of protein synthesis. In this work we provide evidence that the catalytic epsilon subunit of eIF2B is subject to ubiquitination and proteasome-mediated degradation. Lysates of C2C12 myoblasts treated with proteasome inhibitor were subjected to sequential immunoprecipitations for eIF2Bε followed by ubiquitin. Tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) analysis of immunoprecipitated proteins resulted in the identification of five peptides containing ubiquitin (diglycine) modifications on eIF2Bε. The specific lysine residues containing the ubiquitin modifications were localized as Lys-56, Lys-98, Lys-136, Lys-212 and Lys-500 (corresponding to the rat protein sequence). In addition three novel phosphorylation sites were identified including Ser-22, Ser-125, and Thr-317. Moreover, peptides corresponding to the amino acid sequence of the E3 ligase NEDD4 were also detected in the LC-MS/MS analysis, and an interaction between endogenous eIF2Bε with NEDD4 was confirmed by co-immunoprecipitation.
