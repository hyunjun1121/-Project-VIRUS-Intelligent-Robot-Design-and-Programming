What is the mode of action of Thiazovivin?

Today, there is a need for a platform to efficiently generate and maintain a feeder free culture of pluripotent stem cells by small molecules or pharmacological agents. Induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC) is considered a promising resource for restorative cell therapy in clinical areas. While fully reprogrammed iPSCs are similar to embryonic stem cells, iPSCs could be derived from the patient's own cells (autologous), which avoids the immune rejection activities. Recent advances have demonstrated that iPSCs could be generated from human fibroblasts using only four transcription factors: OCT4, SOX2, CMYC, and KLF4. However, the limitations of reprogramming technologies include low efficiency, slow kinetics, transgene integration and residual expression. Surprisingly, adult stem cells from human endometrium (endometrial stem cells; EnSCs) express OCT4 and KLF4 pluripotency factors. On the other hand, small molecule inhibitors of specific signaling pathways such as thiazovivin have been used in various aspects of iPSC generation and maintenance. Thiazovivin is a selective small molecule that directly targets Rho-associated kinase (ROCK) and increases expression of pluripotency factors. The process using thiazovivin could be easier, faster and more cost effective than transgene integration into somatic cells. So reprogramming of OCT4 and KLF4 expressing EnSCs by a ROCK inhibitor, thiazovivin, could result in producing more efficient iPSCs compared with fibroblasts or conventional somatic cells without integration any transgene and retroviral vector.

Corneal diseases exhibit a high prevalence and are prone to cause blindness; furthermore, maintaining the morphology and ionic transporter expression in corneal endothelial cells (CECs) is crucial for treatment of these diseases. This study aimed to investigate the effects of the novel Rho associated coiled-coil containing protein kinase (ROCK) inhibitor, thiazovivin (2,4‑disubstituted thiazole, TZV), on human corneal endothelial‑to‑mesenchymal transition/epithelial‑to‑mesenchymal transition (EndMT/EMT), cell morphology, junction proteins and ionic transporter expression in human CECs (HCECs) in vitro and then to clarify the mechanisms of action of TZV. In the present study, primary HCECs were cultured in vitro and passaged. The expression levels of adhesion proteins (E‑cadherin and N‑cadherin), the EndMT/EMT marker, α smooth muscle  actin (α‑SMA), the tight junction protein, Zonula occludens-1 (ZO‑1), and the ionic transporter, Na+/K+‑ATPase, were detected by immunofluorescence. The proliferative ability of the HCECs was determined by CCK-8 assay. The mRNA expression of the EndMT/EMT‑inducing gene, Snail, was examined by RT‑PCR. The protein expression levels of ROCK1/2 were evaluated by western blot analysis. The HCECs were cultured with TZV at various concentrations (2, 4, or 6 µM) for different periods of time (24 or 48 h). We found that the the cell states of the HCECs co‑cultured with 4 µM TZV for 48 h reached the optimum, and corneal EndMT/EMT was inhibited, as evidenced by the significantly upregulated expression of ZO‑1 and E‑cadherin, and the markedly downregulated expression of N‑cadherin and α‑SMA. Furthermore, the cells exhibited a normal, tightly connected hexagonal or pentagonal morphology. Additionally, the protein expression of ROCK1/2 and the mRNA expression of Snail were significantly decreased. However, there was no significant difference between the TZV‑treated and the control groups as regards HCEC proliferative ability. These findings suggested that the ROCK inhibitor, TZV (4 µM), was effective in improving the morphology, cell junctions and ionic transporter expression of HCECs by inhibiting EndMT/EMT, but had no effect on HCEC proliferation.

To evaluate the effect of thiazovivin, a novel ROCK inhibitor, on the morphology and function of human corneal endothelial cells(HCECs). The primary HCECs were identified by light microscopy and immunofluorescence staining of neuron-specific enolase. To screen the optimal concentration and action time of thiazovivin for maintaining the morphology and function of primary HCECs, Na (+)/K (+)-ATPase and N-cadherin were chosen as indicators, and the morphology and function of HCECs in various concentrations(0 μmol/L, 2 μmol/L, 4 μmol/L, and 6 μmol/L)for different durations(24 h and 48 h)were examined by immunofluorescence experiments. The effect of thiazovivin on the expression of ROCK was investigated by immunofluorescence and Western blot. The primary HCECs cultured were hexagonal, closely packed, homogeneously and obviously stained by neuron-specific enolase. The immunofluorescence staining of Na(+)/K(+)-ATPase showed that when the primary HCECs cultured with various concentrations of thiazovivin(0, 2, 4, 6 μmol/L)for 24 h, the fluorescence were obvious, and the average absorbance values(A)were 1.27±0.08, 3.72±0.17, 21.07±4.67, 3.69±0.34, respectively. And the immunofluorescence staining of N-cadherin revealed that when the primary HCECs treated with 4 μmol/L thiazovivin for 24 h, the cell boundary was clear and the structure of the cells was intact. While the treating time of thiazovivin(4 μmol/L)on HCECs extended to 48 h, the immunofluorescence staining of Na(+)/K(+)-ATPase and N-cadherin showed that compared to HCECs treated with thiazovivin(4 μmol/L)for 24 h, the fluorescence intensity did not change significantly, but the cells arranged slightly untidy. In addition, the immunofluorescence staining of ROCK was weakened and the expression of ROCK was reduced by thiazovivin. Thiazovivin was effective for protecting the morphology and function of HCECs. An optimal improvement in the morphology, connection and function of HCECs was found when the primary HCECs were cultured with 4 μmol/L thiazovivin for 24 h. Moreover, the expression of ROCK protein could be significantly inhibited by thiazovivin. (Chin J Ophthalmol, 2016, 52: 686-692).
