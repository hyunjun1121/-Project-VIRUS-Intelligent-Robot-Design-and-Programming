The aim of the study was to present the authors' own experience and discuss the treatment method of arachnoid cysts of the middle cranial fossa disclosed as subdural hematoma. Three cases of male patients operated on because of chronic subdural hematoma are presented. Control CT studies after evacuation of hematomas revealed arachnoid cysts of the middle cranial fossa and all patients were qualified for delayed cystocisternostomy by open craniotomy. Indirect signs of presence of arachnoid cysts in the form of bony abnormalities and expanded the middle cranial fossa in the first CT were seen in all patients. Cysts were asymptomatic until the injury in all cases. The volumes of cysts in MRI scans were: 17.8 ml, 52.9 ml and 92.4 ml, respectively. All cysts were type II according to Galassi classification. After control MRI described above made to evaluate cyst appearance, delayed cystocisternostomy to basal cisterns was undertaken in two cases with full success. No complications were observed. The third patient refused surgery. During surgery the thick and non-transparent medial cyst wall and arachnoidea of tentorial notch cisterns were observed impeding the exact identification of neurovascular structures. In our opinion arachnoid cysts of the middle cranial fossa revealed as subdural hematoma should be operated on in two stages: in the first step subdural hematoma should be evacuated and in the second step cystocisternostomy should be performed. With regard to observed morphological changes of arachnoidea and cyst walls we think that open cystocisternostomy is treatment of choice in these cases.

The decision making process for patients with sylvian fissure arachnoid cysts still represents a challenge for the neurosurgeon. A high proportion of the patients is indeed asymptomatic, in spite of neuroimaging signs of apparently increased intracranial pressure (ICP). The aim of the present study was to evaluate the usefulness of prolonged ICP recording in the preoperative work-out. Twelve children (11 M/1 F) harboring temporal arachnoid cysts were investigated (men age 6.3 years). According to Galassi classification they were subdivided into 3 groups. Group I included 3 patients with Type I cysts; group II comprised 6 children with Type II cysts; group III consisted of 3 children with Type III cysts. An extensible silicone microprocessor (Codman ), developed for continuous ICP recording, was implanted intraparenchymally, adjacent to the major extension of the cyst. The collected information was cable unloaded to a PC and stored. All the patients underwent a minimum of 48 hours to a maximum of 72 hours ICP continuous check. Ten mmHg was arbitrarily chosen as the upper normal limit of ICP in resting conditions and the patients were classified according to the percentile distribution of their ICP daily and nightly pressure values. ICP recordings were in the normal range in all the 3 children with Type I cysts (49-86% <10 mmHg during the entire recording), in spite of the fact that 2 of them were apparently symptomatic. Three of the 6 children with a Type II temporal cyst had elevated ICP values (69-99% >10 mmHG), even though they had an incidental (1 case) or prenatal (2 cases) diagnosis. The remaining 3 patients had normal ICP values for more than 70% of the recording time period. Two of the 3 patients with type III temporal arachnoid cysts had almost constantly abnormal ICP values (95=99% >10 mmHg); conversely the third patient showed normal ICP values for more than 80% of the recording time period. Five patients were operated on; in 4 of them the surgical indication was based on ICP recordings (2 of the 3 children with a Type II cyst and increased ICP and the 2 patients with a Type III cyst and increased ICP). The last child, harboring a Type I cyst, was operated on under parents request, as a preventive measure. At a mean follow-up of 10.1 months all the patients operated on are in excellent clinical conditions; 1 of them (Type II cyst) initially submitted to craniotomy and cystic membrane excision needed a subdural-peritoneal shunt implant 3 months after surgery for the appearance of a symptomatic subdural hygroma on the side of the cyst. Postoperative CT showed signs of brain expansion in the 2 patients operated on for a Type III cyst, and in the patients operated on for a Type I cyst. With the limit of the relatively small series here presented, prolonged ICP recording appeared to be an important preoperative tool to rule out the necessity of operating on children with Type I cysts. Furthermore, it was particularly useful in the decision-making process for children with Type III cysts. In cases of Type II lesions, the investigation resulted less discriminating, though the ICP monitoring contributed to find out those patients in whom surgery was indicated in spite of the absence of symptoms.

The best operative intervention for children with arachnoid cysts remains the subject of controversy. Recent reports stress that craniotomy for cyst fenestration is associated with a low incidence of morbidity and mortality and may leave the child shunt-independent. Among a total of 66 intracranial arachnoid cysts operated on in the authors' department from 1985 to 1997, 44 cases (67%) were located in the middle cranial fossa. A higher incidence in the first decade of life (53 cases) and a marked male predominance (45 cases) were recognized. Headache, cranial deformities, symptoms of raised intracranial pressure, and seizures constituted the most frequent features of the clinical presentation. To determine which treatment provides the greatest benefit with the lowest incidence of complications, the records of the 44 patients with arachnoid cysts in the middle cranial fossa were reviewed. The mean age of these patients was 4.6 years (range 0-16 years). Different types of initial surgical procedures were performed. In 33 patients with middle cranial fossa arachnoid cysts (MCFAC) the initial surgery took the form of craniotomy with excision of the cyst walls and fenestration into the basal cisterns. Shunting procedures were performed in 9 patients: cysto-peritoneal shunts (CPS) were placed in 4 patients and ventriculo-peritoneal shunts (VPS), in 3 patients, and cyst excision was performed in addition to CPS in 2 patients. Excision of the cyst membrane alone without fenestration was performed in 2 patients. The initial treatment was successful in terms of reduced symptoms and decreased cyst size, with no additional treatment needed for the cyst, in 79% (26/33) of patients who had undergone excision of the cyst walls and fenestration into the basal cisterns, compared with 66% (6/9) of patients who had undergone shunting procedures. Cyst membrane excision was not successful in any of the patients who underwent this procedure alone. No significant difference in morbidity was noted between these different treatment options. On follow-up CT scan and MRI, cysts of types I and II (Galassi classification) exhibited a steady tendency to reduction or obliteration. These results confirm that radical excision of the outer and inner membranes of the cyst wall with fenestration into the basal cistern is a safe and effective shunt-independent procedure for MCFAC, especially for those of types I and II.

The decision making process for patients with Sylvian fissure arachnoid cysts still represents a challenge for the neurosurgeon. A high percentage of patients are indeed asymptomatic, despite neuroimaging signs of apparently increased intracranial pressure (ICP). The present study was conducted to evaluate the usefulness of prolonged ICP recording in the preoperative work-up. Eleven children (10 M/1 F) harboring temporal arachnoid cysts were investigated (mean age: 5.9 years). According to Galassi classification they were subdivided in three groups. Group I was made up of three patients with Type I cysts; Group II comprised six children with Type II cysts; Group III consisted of two children with Type III cysts. An extensible silicone microprocessor (Codman), developed for continuous ICP recording, was implanted intraparenchymally, adjacent to the major extension of the cyst. The collected information was cable unloaded to a PC and stored. All the patients underwent a minimum of 48 hours to a maximum of 72 hours of ICP continuous check. In resting conditions, 10 mm Hg was arbitrarily chosen as the upper normal limit of ICP, and the patients were classified according to the percentile distribution of their ICP daily and nightly pressure values. ICP recordings were in the normal range in all the three children with Type I cysts (49-86%< 10 mm Hg during the entire recording), despite the fact that two of them were apparently symptomatic. Three of the six children with a Type II temporal cyst had elevated ICP values (69-99%> 10 mm Hg), even though they had an incidental (1 case) or prenatal (2 cases) diagnosis. The remaining three patients had normal ICP values for more than 70% of the recording time period. The two patients with type III temporal arachnoid cysts had almost constantly abnormal ICP values (95-99%> 10 mm Hg). Five patients were operated; in four of them the surgical indication was based on ICP recordings (two of the three children with a Type II cyst and increased ICP and the two patients with a Type III cyst). The last child, harboring a Type I cyst, was operated upon parents' request, as a preventive measure. At a mean follow-up of 9.3 months all the patients operated on are in excellent clinical condition; one of them (Type II cyst) initially undergoing a craniotomy and cystic membrane excision required a subduro-peritoneal shunt implant 3 months after surgery for a symptomatic subdural hygroma on the side of the cyst. Postoperative computed tomography showed signs of brain expansion in the two patients operated on for a Type III cyst, and in the patient operated on for a Type I cyst. With the limit of the relatively small series presented here, prolonged ICP recording appeared to be an important preoperative tool to rule out the necessity of operating on children with Type I cysts. Furthermore, the study confirmed that an increase of the ICP is almost constantly present in children with Type III cysts. In cases of Type II lesions, the study results were less discriminating, though the ICP monitoring contributed in identifying those patients in whom surgery was indicated despite the absence of symptoms.

In this study, we explored the operation options for middle cranial fossa arachnoid cysts (MCFAC). One hundred and forty-nine patients who were operated for a symptomatic MCFAC between 1993 and 2006 in our hosptial were analyzed. Follow-up time ranged from 1 y to 14 y (mean=5.4 y). All these patients were divided into three subgroups according to Galassi classification. Long-term outcome and complications were studied respectively. Fenestration (F) resulted in a more favorable long-term outcome and less complication for cysts of types I and II, whereas a favorable outcome was noted in type III patients who underwent cysto-peritoneal shunting (S). We are led to conclude that Fenestration is suitable for cysts of types I and II (Galassi classification), cysto-peritoneal shunting is better for cysts of type III.

We report the case of a 36-year-old woman with a Sylvian fissure arachnoid cyst, which diminished after head trauma and minor hemorrhage into the cyst. We discuss the relationship between the cyst volume reduction and the head trauma to determine the main mechanism of this self-healing process.

The authors present CT and MRI of a patient with an extremely large arachnoidal cyst (Galassi classification type III). The cyst extended from the base of the skull, posterior to the brain stem, on the base of the temporal lobe over the complete convexity of the left hemisphere. The cyst consisted of multiple compartments with intracystic septa and was accompanied by a chronic subdural hemorrhage in the compartments. After contrast agent application, the typical characteristics of chronic subdural membranes were found. Besides bony deformities, a thinning of the inner table was found. The patient underwent craniotomy for evacuation of the hemorrhage and fenestration of the septa while he was free of symptoms. This is a remarkable case proving that chronic local intracranial pressure does not inevitably lead to neurologic symptoms or intellectual disabilities.
