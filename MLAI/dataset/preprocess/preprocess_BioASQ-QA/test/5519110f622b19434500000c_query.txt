Which disease is included as an additional feature in the Goldberg-Shprintzen syndrome?

[PMID: 12878302]
Neurocristopathies are a group of diverse disorders resulting from defective growth, differentiation, and migration of the neural crest cells. Hirschsprung's disease, namely aganglionic megacolon, is the consequence of defective migration of neural crest cells on to the colonic submucosa and is therefore considered a neurocristopathy. We report on four children in whom was diagnosed a neurocristopathy, associating Hirschsprung's disease with a wide spectrum of neurologic abnormalities. The patients included two children presenting the phenotypic features of the Goldberg-Shprintzen syndrome: distinct dysmorphic facial features, microcephaly, and mental retardation, along with agenesis of the corpus callosum and cortical malformations associated with intractable seizures in one child. The third newborn presented with the Haddad syndrome: short-segment Hirschsprung's disease associated with the congenital central hypoventilation syndrome requiring permanent artificial ventilation. In the fourth child, absence of the corpus callosum was associated with mild dysmorphic features, borderline cognitive abilities, and attention-deficit disorder. Therefore, awareness of a possible neurocristopathy associated with neurologic abnormalities should be taken into account in any patient newly diagnosed with Hirschsprung's disease to detect the abnormalities early and promptly manage them. A thorough neurologic examination and a developmental assessment, including magnetic resonance imaging of the brain and electroencephalography, should be performed for any child presenting with an aganglionic megacolon, especially those presenting with seizures, developmental delay, or even congenital hypoventilation.

We describe 4 girls with Shprintzen-Goldberg syndrome. Skeletal abnormalities common to 3 of them include bowing of long bones (with a variable degree of progression over time), flare of the metaphyses, a large anterior fontanel with persistent patency into the second to fourth years of life, 13 pairs of ribs, distinct vertebral abnormalities which were absent neonatally but evolved by the second year of life, and progressive osteopenia. These abnormalities were generalized and, in one case, progressive over the first few years of life. Communicating hydrocephalus was present in all 4 cases. The eldest, an 11-year-old girl, had additional anomalies not reported previously in this syndrome, including intestinal malrotation, an anteriorly placed anus, and mild cerebral atrophy. This is the first detailed report of skeletal manifestations in this rare disorder of unknown cause. These cases, in conjunction with a review of the literature, suggest that skeletal abnormalities are common in Shprintzen-Goldberg syndrome.

Marfanoid phenotype with craniosynostosis (Shprintzen-Goldberg syndrome) is a rare disorder previously described in only 5 patients. We report on the sixth known patient with this condition. The findings which distinguish our patient from others reported previously are that she was ascertained prenatally as having a cloverleaf skull; this is the first female patient described with this condition. Postnatally, she presented with arachnodactyly, camptodactyly, and clover-leaf skull. Imaging studies of the brain documented microcephaly with malformed brain, hydrocephaly, and hypoplasia of the corpus callosum. She also had choanal atresia and stenosis, a clinical finding previously reported only once, in this disorder.

Mutations in Kif1-binding protein/KIAA1279 (KBP) cause the devastating neurological disorder Goldberg-Shprintzen syndrome (GSS) in humans. The cellular function of KBP and the basis of the symptoms of GSS, however, remain unclear. Here, we report the identification and characterization of a zebrafish kbp mutant. We show that kbp is required for axonal outgrowth and maintenance. In vivo time-lapse analysis of neuronal development shows that the speed of early axonal outgrowth is reduced in both the peripheral and central nervous systems in kbp mutants. Ultrastructural studies reveal that kbp mutants have disruption to axonal microtubules during outgrowth. These results together suggest that kbp is an important regulator of the microtubule dynamics that drive the forward propulsion of axons. At later stages, we observe that many affected axons degenerate. Ultrastructural analyses at these stages demonstrate mislocalization of axonal mitochondria and a reduction in axonal number in the peripheral, central and enteric nervous systems. We propose that kbp is an important regulator of axonal development and that axonal cytoskeletal defects underlie the nervous system defects in GSS.

Elevated transforming growth factor (TGF)-β signaling has been implicated in the pathogenesis of syndromic presentations of aortic aneurysm, including Marfan syndrome (MFS) and Loeys-Dietz syndrome (LDS). However, the location and character of many of the causal mutations in LDS intuitively imply diminished TGF-β signaling. Taken together, these data have engendered controversy regarding the specific role of TGF-β in disease pathogenesis. Shprintzen-Goldberg syndrome (SGS) has considerable phenotypic overlap with MFS and LDS, including aortic aneurysm. We identified causative variation in ten individuals with SGS in the proto-oncogene SKI, a known repressor of TGF-β activity. Cultured dermal fibroblasts from affected individuals showed enhanced activation of TGF-β signaling cascades and higher expression of TGF-β-responsive genes relative to control cells. Morpholino-induced silencing of SKI paralogs in zebrafish recapitulated abnormalities seen in humans with SGS. These data support the conclusions that increased TGF-β signaling is the mechanism underlying SGS and that high signaling contributes to multiple syndromic presentations of aortic aneurysm.

We describe a brother and sister with Hirschsprung disease, hypotonia, and ptosis. Their condition resembles that in 2 sibs reported by Goldberg and Shprintzen. We conclude that the clinical characteristics in 8 reported cases with similar clinical manifestations represent a distinct autosomal recessive syndrome, Goldberg-Shprintzen syndrome.

Goldberg-Shprintzen syndrome (GOSHS, MIM #609460) is an autosomal recessive disorder of intellectual disability, specific facial gestalt and Hirschsprung's disease (HSCR). In 2005, homozygosity mapping in a large consanguineous family identified KIAA1279 as the disease-causing gene. KIAA1279 encodes KIF-binding protein (KBP), whose function is incompletely understood. Studies have identified either the mitochondria or the cytoskeleton as the site of KBP localization and interactions. To better delineate the KIAA1279-related clinical spectrum and the molecular mechanisms involved in GOSHS, we studied five new patients from three different families. The homozygous KIAA1279 mutations in these patients (p.Arg90X, p.Ser200X or p.Arg202IlefsX2) led to nonsense-mediated mRNA decay and loss of KBP function. Despite the absence of functional KBP, respiratory chain complex activity in patient fibroblasts was normal. KBP did not co-localize with mitochondria in control human fibroblasts, but interacted with the actin and tubulin cytoskeleton. KBP expression directly affected neurite growth in a neuron-like cell line (human neuroblastoma SH-SY5Y), in keeping with the central (polymicrogyria) and enteric (HSCR) neuronal developmental defects seen in GOSHS patients. The KBP interactions with actin filaments and microtubules (MTs) demonstrated in our study constitute the first evidence that an actin MT cross-link protein is involved in neuronal development in humans.

Recent reports have described a distinct and recurrent pattern of systemic malformation that associates craniosynostosis and neurodevelopmental abnormalities with many clinical features of the Marfan syndrome (MFS), an autosomal dominant disorder of the extracellular microfibril caused by defects in the gene encoding fibrillin-1, FBN1 (ref. 8). Additional common findings include other craniofacial anomalies, hypotonia, obstructive apnea, foot deformity, and congenital weakness of the abdominal wall. So far, only 11 cases have been reported precluding the assignment of definitive diagnostic criteria. While it remains unclear whether these cases represent a discrete clinical entity with a single aetiology, they have been pragmatically grouped under the rubric Marfanoid-craniosynostosis or Shprintzen-Goldberg syndrome (SGS). Because of the significant clinical overlap between MFS and SGS, we proposed that they may be caused by allelic mutations. We now report two SGS patients who harbour mutations in FBN1. While it remains unclear whether these mutations are sufficient for the clinical expression of the entire SGS phenotype, these data suggest a role for fibrillin-1 in early craniofacial and central nervous system development. Our recent observation that FBN1 transcript is expressed as early as the 8-cell stage of human embryogenesis is consistent with this hypothesis.

The Shprintzen-Goldberg syndrome is an extremely rare syndrome with a characteristic face. This is one of a group of disorders characterized by craniosynostosis and marfanoid features. The aim of this study was to present a new sporadic case of the syndrome and describe in detail the findings at the maxillofacial region.

We report a case of successful fiberoptic tracheal intubation through the supraglottic airway device air-Q in a 14-year-old boy in whom intubation was difficult because of Shprintzen-Goldberg syndrome. Shprintzen-Goldberg syndrome is a rare congenital disorder of connective tissue. The patient showed dysmorphic facies and weakness of connective tissue, and was scheduled to undergo abdominal surgery. After induction of general anesthesia, both attempts of laryngoscope-guided and AirwayScope -guided tracheal intubation failed, but a size-2 air-Q could be easily inserted. Fiberoptic tracheal intubation through the air-Q was successfully performed without any difficulty and was safe for his weak airway connective tissue. Supraglottic airway air-Q is a useful conduit for fiberoptic tracheal intubation under general anesthesia, especially in the case of a patient with weak connective tissue in whom intubation is difficult.

We report on maternal half-sibs born to unaffected, non-consanguineous parents with classical Shprintzen-Goldberg syndrome (SGS) who had in addition intestinal malrotation and an aberrant subclavian artery. In one other SGS family germline mosaicism has been described. SGS is molecularly heterogeneous and has been linked to mutations in three genomic loci. This suggests there may be multiple other genetic factors that result in a common clinical phenotype and a number of investigators have implicated a fourth region (15q25-qter) in the etiology of SGS.

Shprintzen-Goldberg syndrome (SGS) is characterized by craniosynostosis and marfanoid habitus. The clinical findings of SGS include neurological, cardiovascular, connective tissue, and skeletal abnormalities. Among these skeletal findings, developmental scoliosis is recognized in half of all patients with SGS. However, no earlier reports have described the surgical treatment of scoliosis associated with SGS. Four patients (2 boys and 2 girls; mean age at the time of surgery, 7.3±4.4 y) with SGS who underwent surgical treatment for progressive scoliosis were reviewed. The radiologic findings, operative findings, and perioperative complications were evaluated. The mean preoperative Cobb angle was 102.8±16.9 degrees. The curve patterns were a double curve in 2 cases and a triple curve in 2 cases. Local kyphosis at the thoracolumbar area was recognized in all the cases with a mean kyphosis angle of 49±16 degrees. Growing rod procedures were performed in 2 patients, and posterior correction and fusion were performed in 2 patients. The mean correction rate was 45% in the patients who underwent the growing rod procedures at the time of growing rod placement and 51% in the patients who underwent posterior correction and fusion. Dislodgement of the proximal anchors occurred in 3 of the 4 patients. One patient developed pseudoarthrosis. Two patients developed deep wound infections, and implant removal was necessary in 1 patient. Surgical treatment for scoliosis in patients with SGS was associated with a high incidence of perioperative and postoperative complications including implant dislodgements and deep wound infections attributable to poor bone quality and a thin body habitus, which are characteristic clinical features of this syndrome. Careful preoperative surgical planning and postoperative care are critical for the surgical treatment of scoliosis associated with SGS, especially in infants requiring multiple surgeries. Level IV.

Recognition of the phenotypic spectrum and prognosis of a genetic disorder is critical to proper patient care. A 7-year-old boy with Sphrintzen-Goldberg syndrome (SGS) was studied to investigate speech, language and voice patterns associated with this syndrome. The child's language (expressive and receptive) and speech was characterized with regard to overall intelligibility, articulation (phonetic and phonological errors), voice (flexible videolaryngostroboscopy, quality, pitch and loudness) and resonance (type of disorders). Based on this detailed study the most striking communication characteristics in this child with SGS appear to be a delayed speech and language onset, an expressive and receptive language disorder, a moderately impaired speech intelligbility, relatively good phonetic but poorer phonological abilities, an oral hypotonia, a high-pitched soft voice and a slight hypernasality. The explanation for this communication disorder is not completely straightforward. It is not clear either to what extent the present case can be considered as typical for SGS. Only more data will allow to determine whether or not SGS is associated with a typical syndrome specific pattern of communication disorders. Not only detailed speech and language analyses of additional cases of SGS are necessary, but also studies that compare the speech and language of individuals with SGS with that of individuals with other genetic syndrome.

Hirschsprung disease, mental retardation, microcephaly, and specific craniofacial dysmorphism were observed in three children from a large, consanguineous, Moroccan family. A fourth child showed similar clinical features, with the exception of Hirschsprung disease. The association of these abnormalities in these children represents the Goldberg-Shprintzen syndrome (OMIM 235730). Mutation scanning of genes potentially involved in Hirschsprung disease, RET, GDNF, EDN3, and EDNRB, showed a sequence variant, Ser305Asn, in exon 4 of the EDNRB gene in the index patient of this family. The Ser305Asn substitution present in two of the four patients and four healthy relatives and absent in one of the remaining two patients illustrates the difficulties in interpreting the presence of mutations in families with Hirschsprung disease. It is unlikely that the EDNRB variant contributes to the phenotype. This consanguineous family might be useful for the identification of a Goldberg-Shprintzen locus.

Goldberg-Shprintzen syndrome (GOSHS) is a rare clinical disorder characterized by central and enteric nervous system defects. This syndrome is caused by inactivating mutations in the Kinesin Binding Protein (KBP) gene, which encodes a protein of which the precise function is largely unclear. We show that KBP expression is up-regulated during neuronal development in mouse cortical neurons. Moreover, KBP-depleted PC12 cells were defective in nerve growth factor-induced differentiation and neurite outgrowth, suggesting that KBP is required for cell differentiation and neurite development. To identify KBP interacting proteins, we performed a yeast two-hybrid screen and found that KBP binds almost exclusively to microtubule associated or related proteins, specifically SCG10 and several kinesins. We confirmed these results by validating KBP interaction with one of these proteins: SCG10, a microtubule destabilizing protein. Zebrafish studies further demonstrated an epistatic interaction between KBP and SCG10 in vivo. To investigate the possibility of direct interaction between KBP and microtubules, we undertook co-localization and in vitro binding assays, but found no evidence of direct binding. Thus, our data indicate that KBP is involved in neuronal differentiation and that the central and enteric nervous system defects seen in GOSHS are likely caused by microtubule-related defects.

Annuloaortic ectasia due to Shprintzen-Goldberg syndrome (SGS) is reported. A 10-year-old boy was admitted to our hospital for evaluation of chest pain. On admission, he was diagnosed as SGS on the basis of his various anomalies. Two-dimensional echocardiography showed a bicuspid aortic valve and marked annular dilatation, Doppler flow studies revealed severe aortic regurgitation, and retrograde aortography showed severe aortic regurgitation with annular dilatation. Successful aortic root replacement was performed; subsequent histologic examination of the ascending aorta demonstrated cystic medial necrosis. In conclusion, SGS is a generalized connective tissue dysplasia, with clinical manifestations of cardiovascular lesions similar to those in Marfan syndrome. Aortic root replacement was successfully performed; however, recurrence of aortic aneurysms outside of the ascending aorta should be carefully observed. Surgical treatment for cardiovascular disorders may be necessary to save the life of patients with SGS.

In 1981, Goldberg and Shprintzen described siblings with short-segment Hirschsprung disease, cleft palate, microcephaly, mild mental retardation, short stature and distinctive facial appearance. There have been several subsequent reports which broaden the phenotype. This paper describes a further family, reviews the literature and stresses the intra-familial variability.

We report the case of a Japanese boy whose dysmorphic features were consistent with those of Shprintzen-Goldberg syndrome. The radiological features were characterized by late-onset craniosynostosis, arachnodactyly, undermodeling of short tubular bones, mildly undermodeled and slightly bowed long bones, twisted ribs and tall vertebral bodies with elongated neural arches. Apart from the craniosynostosis, these skeletal changes resembled those of frontometaphyseal dysplasia, a well-known craniotubular dysplasia. Shprintzen-Goldberg syndrome also shares many clinical features with frontometaphyseal dysplasia.

Goldberg-Shprintzen syndrome is a rare autosomal recessive condition that describes the association of Hirschsprung disease with microcephaly, developmental delay and characteristic facies. We describe two brothers from a non-consanguineous family who have classical features of Goldberg-Shprintzen syndrome. The novel findings in this instance are of foot anomalies including camptodactyly and clinodactyly of the 2nd to 4th toes, which have not been previously described in Goldberg-Shprintzen syndrome.

We identified, by homozygosity mapping, a novel locus on 10q21.3-q22.1 for Goldberg-Shprintzen syndrome (GOSHS) in a consanguineous Moroccan family. Phenotypic features of GOSHS in this inbred family included microcephaly and mental retardation, which are both central nervous system defects, as well as Hirschsprung disease, an enteric nervous system defect. Furthermore, since bilateral generalized polymicogyria was diagnosed in all patients in this family, this feature might also be considered a key feature of the syndrome. We demonstrate that homozygous nonsense mutations in KIAA1279 at 10q22.1, encoding a protein with two tetratrico peptide repeats, underlie this syndromic form of Hirschsprung disease and generalized polymicrogyria, establishing the importance of KIAA1279 in both enteric and central nervous system development.

Shprintzen-Goldberg syndrome is one of a group of disorders characterized by craniosynostosis and marfanoid habitus. Eleven cases were reported previously. We present 4 new patients and review one of the patients of the original report of Shprintzen and Goldberg [1982: J Craniofac Genet Dev Biol 2:65-74], 15 years later. The clinical and radiologic findings on our patients are compared with those of the previously reported patients and also with those of Furlong et al. [1987: Am J Med Genet 26:599-604] and Lacombe and Battin [1993: Clin Dysmorphol 2: 220-224], who share many of the characteristics of Shprintzen-Goldberg syndrome. Some of the clinical data are helpful in determining if the patients of Furlong et al. [1987: Am J Med Genet 26:599-604] and Lacombe and Battin [1993: Clin Dysmorphol 2: 220-224] have a separate syndrome or represent a variant of Shprintzen-Goldberg syndrome. However, radiologic investigations appear to be more specific, since an abnormality of the first and second cervical vertebrae, hydrocephalus, dilatation of the lateral ventricles, and a Chiari-I malformation of the brain were found only in the patients with Shprintzen-Goldberg syndrome. The apparently diagnostic findings of the 15 patients with this syndrome may be helpful in differentiating between Shprintzen-Goldberg syndrome and other syndromes with craniosynostosis and marfanoid habitus.

Shprintzen-Goldberg syndrome (SGS) is a rare disorder characterized by a Marfan-like habitus, mental retardation and craniosynostosis. Cardiac abnormalities, such as aortic root dilation have also been noted as well as several skeletal abnormalities. Its nosological status is unclear as it is hard to delineate SGS from similar disorders, such as Furlong, Marfan type II, Camurati-Engelmann and Loeys-Dietz syndromes. It has been suggested that these conditions represent a phenotypical spectrum associated with aberrant TGF-beta signalling. In support of this notion, we found a novel TGFBR2 missense mutation in a patient with features of SGS.

A 5-year-old girl with Hirschsprung disease, unusual facial appearance, psychomotor retardation, epilepsy, and congenital heart disease is reported. Patients with similar clinical features have been reported and they appear to exhibit the recently identified Goldberg-Shprintzen syndrome. It is believed that this girl also exhibits this new syndrome. Cranial computed tomography demonstrated abnormal findings that may suggest defective neuronal migration and/or dysgenesis of the brain. These findings were considered to cause psychomotor retardation and epilepsy in this patient.

The Shprintzen-Goldberg syndrome (SGS) is a disorder of unknown cause comprising craniosynostosis, a marfanoid habitus and skeletal, neurological, cardiovascular, and connective-tissue anomalies. There are no pathognomonic signs of SGS and diagnosis depends on recognition of a characteristic combination of anomalies. Here, we describe 14 persons with SGS and compare their clinical findings with those of 23 previously reported individuals, including two families with more than one affected individual. Our analysis suggests that there is a characteristic facial appearance, with more than two thirds of all individuals having hypertelorism, down-slanting palpebral fissures, a high-arched palate, micrognathia, and apparently low-set and posteriorly rotated ears. Other commonly reported manifestations include hypotonia in at least the neonatal period, developmental delay, and inguinal or umbilical hernia. The degree of reported intellectual impairment ranges from mild to severe. The most common skeletal manifestations in SGS were arachnodactyly, pectus deformity, camptodactyly, scoliosis, and joint hypermobility. None of the skeletal signs alone is specific for SGS. Our study includes 14 mainly German individuals with SGS evaluated over a period of 10 years. Given that only 23 other persons with SGS have been reported to date worldwide, we suggest that SGS may be more common than previously assumed.

Shprintzen-Goldberg syndrome is a rare connective tissue disorder characterized by marfanoid habitus and additional dysmorphic stigmata. Craniocervical anomalies occur in fewer than 30% of cases. Serious vertebral instability can also occur, albeit rarely. The authors report on the first patient treated with surgical fusion at the craniocervical junction because of a C-1 dysplasia and severe instability. The skeletal and cardiovascular anomalies that can pose additional problems for surgical treatment and perioperative care are discussed in detail.
