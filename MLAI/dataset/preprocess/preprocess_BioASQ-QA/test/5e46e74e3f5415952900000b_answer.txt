IDEAL_ANSWER:
- Mutations in the ERCC1 or ERCC4 genes cause a remarkable array of rare inherited human disorders including specific forms of xeroderma pigmentosum. Individuals with NER-defective xeroderma pigmentosum (XP), in which bulky DNA lesions are not efficiently removed, are cancer-prone and suffer neurodegeneration.

EXACT_ANSWER:
- Defective NER, such as mutated ERCC1 or ERCC$ genes
