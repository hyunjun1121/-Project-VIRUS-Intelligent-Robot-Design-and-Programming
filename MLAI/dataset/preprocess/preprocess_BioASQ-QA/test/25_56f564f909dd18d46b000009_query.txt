During the recent cloning of the mouse Lyst gene we developed both a high-resolution genetic map and a complete YAC and BAC contig of the Lyst critical region on mouse Chromosome 13. We also report the mapping of the human homologue of the mouse Lyst gene (LYST) to 1q43. These data are consistent with LYST being the gene for the human Chediak-Higashi Syndrome and strengthen the synteny relationship between MMU13 and human 1q43.

A 2-month-old female infant, born to consanguineous parents, presented with infections in skin and upper respiratory tract. She was notable for delayed umbilical cord detachment, partial albinism, and neurological irritability. Giant granules were present in white blood cells. The intracellular perforin content in CD8 T cells seems to correlate to the immune activation state of the patient with 82% and 8% perforin-containing CD8 T cells at active and nonactive hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis (HLH) disease, respectively. HLH was confirmed by hemophagocytosis in bone marrow and absent natural killer cell activity. The patient carried a homozygous G>A mutation in the 3' splice site of intron 24 of the LYST/CHS1 gene, leading to the use of an alternative YAG splice site located in exon 25, introducing a premature STOP codon (L2355fsX2370; NP_000072.2). The early-onset accelerated phase in this severe phenotype of Chediak-Higashi syndrome was probably induced by rotaviral infection. Interestingly, the intracellular perforin content in CD8 T cells seems to correlate to the immune activation state of the patient. Late separation of the umbilical cord in concordance with clinical symptoms should lead to evaluation of a possible neutrophil dysfunction including Chediak-Higashi syndrome before onset of HLH.

Vesicular transport to and from the lysosome and late endosome is defective in patients with Chediak-Higashi syndrome (CHS) and in mutant beige (bg) mice. CHS and bg cells have giant, perinuclear vesicles with characteristics of late endosomes and lysosomes that arise from dysregulated homotypic fusion. CHS and bg lysosomes also exhibit compartmental missorting of proteins, such as elastase, glucuronidase and cathepsin G. Lyst, a candidate gene for bg, was identified by direct complementary DNA selection from a yeast artificial chromosome (YAC) clone containing a 650-kilobase segment of the bg-critical region on mouse chromosome 13. Lyst is disrupted by a 5-kilobase deletion in bg mice, and Lyst messenger RNA is markedly reduced in bg homozygotes. The homologous human gene, LYST, is highly conserved with mouse Lyst, and contains a frame-shift mutation at nucleotides 117-118 of the coding domain in a CHS patient. Thus bg mice and human CHS patients have homologous disorders associated with Lyst mutations. Lyst encodes a protein with a carboxy-terminal prenylation motif and multiple potential phosphorylation sites. Lyst protein is predicted to form extended helical domains, and has a region of sequence similar to stathmin, a coiled-coil phosphoprotein thought to act as a relay integrating cellular signal response coupling.

Chediak-Higashi syndrome (CHS) is a rare autosomal recessive disease resulting from mutations in the LYST/CHS1 gene, which encodes for a 429 kDa protein, CHS1/LYST, that regulates vesicle trafficking and determines the size of lysosomes and other organelles. To date, 60 different mutations have been characterized, and a reasonably straightforward phenotype-genotype correlation has been suggested. We describe two patients on opposite ends of the CHS clinical spectrum with novel missense mutations. We characterized these patients in terms of their mutations, protein localization and expression, mRNA stability, and electrostatic potential. Patient 1 is the first report of a severe early-onset CHS with a homozygous missense mutation (c.11362 G>A, p.G3725R) in the LYST/CHS1 gene. This molecular change results in a reduction at the CHS1 protein level, not due to an mRNA effect, but maybe a consequence of both, a change in the structure of the protein and most likely attributable to the remarkable serious perturbation in the electrostatic potential. Patient 2, who exhibited the adolescence form of the disease, was found to be homozygous for a novel missense mutation c.961 T>C, p.C258R, which seemed to have minor effect on the structure of the CHS1/LYST protein. Reexamining accepted premises of missense mutant alleles being reported among patients with clinically mild forms of the disorder should be carried out, and attempts to link genotype and clinical phenotype require identifying the actual molecular effect of the mutation. Early and accurate diagnosis of the severity of the disease is extremely important to early differentiate patients who would benefit from premature enrollment into a transplantation protocol.

Chediak Higashi syndrome (CHS) is an autosomal-recessive disorder characterized by oculocutaneous albinism, recurrent infections and a progressive primary neurological disease. Here, we describe two siblings with CHS due to a novel homozygous R1836X mutation in the LYST gene associated with loss of NK cell degranulation and cytotoxicity. While one sibling was born with fair skin and hair and died of hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis (HLH) at 5 months of age, the other sibling had dark black hair and skin and developed HLH at the age of 4 years.

Chediak-Higashi syndrome, a rare autosomal recessive disorder, was described over 50 years ago. Patients show hypopigmentation, recurrent infections, mild coagulation defects and varying neurologic problems. Treatment is bone marrow transplant, which is effective in treating the hematologic and immune defects, however the neurologic problems persist. The CHS1/LYST gene was identified over 10 years ago and homologous CHS1/LYST genes are present in all eukaryotes. This review will discuss the advances made in understanding the clinical aspects of the syndrome and the function of CHS1/LYST/Beige. Clinical reports of Chediak-Higashi syndrome have identified mutations throughout the CHS1/LYST gene. The nature of the mutation can be a predictor of the severity of the disease. Over the past decade the CHS1/LYST family of proteins has been analyzed using model organisms, two-hybrid analysis, overexpression phenotypes and dominant negatives. These studies suggest that the CHS1/LYST protein is involved in either vesicle fusion or fission. Although CHS is a rare disease, the Chediak-like family of proteins is providing insight into the regulation of vesicle trafficking. Understanding the basic mechanisms that govern vesicle trafficking will provide essential information regarding how loss of CHS1/LYST affects hematologic, immunologic and neurologic processes.

Disturbance of intracellular trafficking plays a major role in several neurodegenerative disorders including Alzheimer or Parkinson's disease. The Chediak-Higashi syndrome (CHS), a life-threatening autosomal recessive disease with frequent mutations in the LYST gene, and its animal model, the beige mouse, are both characterized by lysosomal defects with accumulation of giant lysosomes. Clinically they manifest as hypopigmentation, abnormal bleeding and increased susceptibility to infection with various degrees of involvement of the nervous system. In the course of a recessive N-ethyl-N-nitrosurea (ENU) mutagenesis screen, we identified the first murine missense mutation in the lysosomal trafficking regulator gene (Lyst(Ing3618)) located at a highly conserved position in the WD40 protein domain. Nearly all described human Lyst alleles lead to protein truncation and fatal childhood CHS. Only four different missense mutations have been reported in patients with adolescent or adult forms of CHS involving the nervous system. Interestingly, the Lyst(Ing3618) model presents with a predominant neurodegenerative phenotype with progressive degeneration and loss of Purkinje cells and lacks severe impairment of the immune system. Therefore, the Lyst(Ing3618 )allele could represent a new model for adult CHS with neurological impairment. It could also provide an important tool to elucidate the role of neuronal lysosomal trafficking in the pathophysiology of neurodegeneration.

Chédiak-Higashi syndrome (CHS) is a rare autosomal recessive disorder characterized by immunodeficiency, neurological dysfunction, and oculocutaneous albinism. Recently, several clinical CHS phenotypes have been reported. Here, we report results of a nationwide survey performed to clarify clinical characteristics and outcomes of CHS patients in Japan. Questionnaires were sent to 287 institutions to collect data regarding CHS patients diagnosed between 2000 and 2010, including results of lysosomal trafficking regulator (LYST) gene analysis. Cytotoxicity and degranulation activity of cytotoxic T lymphocytes were analyzed in available patient samples. A total of 15 patients diagnosed with CHS were eligible for enrollment in this study. Of these, 10 (67%) had recurrent bacterial infections, five (33%) developed life-threatening hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis (HLH), and one patient had complicated malignant lymphoma. Hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) was performed for six patients including three with HLH, and 10 of the enrolled patients have survived at the time of this writing. LYST analysis was performed for 10 patients; seven different mutations were detected in seven patients, whereas no mutation was identified in three patients. Cytotoxicity and degranulation activity were impaired in patients with and without LYST mutation. Results of this survey indicate that one or two patients with CHS were newly diagnosed each year in Japan. The incidence of HLH was not as high as expected. Mutations of genes other than LYST were suspected in some cases. We conclude that determining indication for HSCT for CHS patients should be based on genetic and cytotoxic analysis.

Chediak-Higashi syndrome (CHS) is a rare autosomal recessive disease characterized by variable degrees of oculocutaneous albinism, recurrent infections, and a mild bleeding tendency, with late neurologic dysfunction. Most patients also undergo an accelerated phase of lymphohistiocytosis and die at an early age unless they receive an allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplant (SCT). Mutations in the CHS1 (LYST) gene result in CHS. Here, we describe an adopted infant who is compound heterozygous for two novel CHS1 gene mutations, both of which are predicted to result in truncated proteins. The two mutations are a nonsense mutation (c.1540 C>T, CGA>TGA, R514X) in exon 5 and a one base pair deletion (del c.9893T, F3298fsX3304) in exon 43, coding for part of the CHS1 protein's BEACH domain. These two newly described mutations are expected to give rise to a severe phenotype and, indeed, the patient had absolutely no cytotoxicity by natural killer cells or cytotoxic lymphocytes prior to his allogeneic SCT.

Chediak-Higashi syndrome (CHS) is a rare, autosomal, recessive lysosomal disorder with hematological and immunologic abnormalities; however, stem-cell transplantation from a matched or related donor may be curative. Many mutations of the CHS1/LYST gene have been reported to date. We report a novel nonsense mutation of the CHS1/LYST gene in 3 Omani patients. Three patients from 2 different families presented with clinical and laboratory features of CHS and a history of death of a previous sibling because of a severe illness, suggestive of the accelerated phase of CHS. Giant granules were present in the myeloid cell lines. Before the stem-cell transplant, the first patient underwent gene sequencing of all exons of the lysosome trafficking regulator (CHS1/LYST) gene and revealed a nonsense mutation in exon 5 (c.925C>T, p.R309X). Subsequently, upon presentation, the second and third patients' direct gene sequencing of exon 5 revealed the same mutation. We report a nonsense mutation in exon 5 (c.925C>T, p.R309X). This supports the allelic heterogeneity of CHS and is in line with most reported mutation types that lead to a truncated protein. Identification of the mutation type will facilitate timely diagnosis, management, and family counseling for those with affected children in Oman.

Autosomal-recessive hereditary spastic paraplegias (AR-HSP) consist of a genetically diverse group of neurodegenerative diseases characterised by pyramidal tracts dysfunction. The causative genes for many types of AR-HSP remain elusive. We tried to identify the gene mutation for AR-HSP with cerebellar ataxia and neuropathy. This study included two patients in a Japanese family with their parents who are first cousins. Neurological examination and gene analysis were conducted in the two patients and two normal family members. We undertook genome-wide linkage analysis employing single nucleotide polymorphism arrays using the two patients' DNAs and exome sequencing using one patient's sample. We detected a homozygous missense mutation (c.4189T>G, p.F1397V) in the lysosomal trafficking regulator (LYST) gene, which is described as the causative gene for Chédiak-Higashi syndrome (CHS). CHS is a rare autosomal-recessive syndrome characterised by hypopigmentation, severe immune deficiency, a bleeding tendency and progressive neurological dysfunction. This mutation was co-segregated with the disease in the family and was located at well-conserved amino acid. This LYST mutation was not found in 200 Japanese control DNAs. Microscopic observation of peripheral blood in the two patients disclosed large peroxidase-positive granules in both patients' granulocytes, although they had no symptoms of immune deficiency or bleeding tendency. We diagnosed these patients as having adult CHS presenting spastic paraplegia with cerebellar ataxia and neuropathy. The clinical spectrum of CHS is broader than previously recognised. Adult CHS must be considered in the differential diagnosis of AR-HSP.

Hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis (HLH) is a potentially fatal immune disorder characterized by uncontrolled lymphocyte- and macrophage-activation. The resulting hypercytokinemia and cell infiltration of organs lead to the clinical and laboratory features of HLH. Viral infections and other triggers can induce both, inherited and acquired forms of HLH. Disease-causing mutations in the genes encoding perforin (PRF1, FHL2), munc13-4 (UNC13D, FHL3), syntaxin 11 (STX11, FHL4), and munc18-2 (UNC18-2/STXBP2, FHL5) have been previously identified in Familial Hemophagocyic Lymphohistiocytosis (FHL), whereas mutation in RAB27A and LYST account for Griscelli syndome type 2 and Chediak-Higashi syndrome, respectively. These genes all encode proteins which are involved in the cytotoxic activity of lymphocytes. The inability of activated cytotoxic cells to clear antigen-presenting targets results in sustained immune stimulation, likely accounting for the unremitting polyclonal CD8 T-cell activation and hyperimmune reaction which characterizes FHL. Treatment of HLH consists of elimination of the trigger and immunosuppressive treatment in order to induce remission from the uncontrolled inflammation. Allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation can be indicated in the inherited forms of HLH.

Mutations in LYST, a gene encoding a putative lysosomal trafficking protein, cause Chédiak-Higashi syndrome (CHS), an autosomal recessive disorder typically characterized by infantile-onset hemophagocytic syndrome and immunodeficiency, and oculocutaneous albinism. A small number of reports of rare, attenuated forms of CHS exist, with affected individuals exhibiting progressive neurodegenerative disease beginning in early adulthood with cognitive decline, parkinsonism, features of spinocerebellar degeneration, and peripheral neuropathy, as well as subtle pigmentary abnormalities and subclinical or absent immune dysfunction. In a consanguineous Pakistani kindred with clinical phenotypes consistent with attenuated CHS, we performed SNP array-based homozygosity mapping and whole gene sequencing of LYST. We identified three individuals homozygous for a novel six base pair in-frame deletion in LYST (c.9827_9832ATACAA), predicting the loss of asparagine and threonine residues from the LYST transcript (p.Asn3276_Thr3277del), and segregating with the phenotype in this family. We further characterize the neurologic features of the attenuated form of CHS, and discuss pathophysiologic mechanisms underlying the neurodegenerative components of CHS. Attenuated CHS is phenotypically heterogenous and should be considered when young adults develop neurodegenerative disease and have pigmentary abnormalities. We briefly discuss surveillance and management of patients with CHS-related neurodegeneration.

Cytotoxic T lymphocyte-associated antigen 4 (CTLA-4, also known as CD152) has been shown to play a major role in the regulation of T cell activation. Its membrane expression is highly regulated by endocytosis and trafficking through the secretory lysosome pathway. Chediak-Higashi syndrome (CHS) is an inherited disorder caused by mutations in the lysosomal trafficking regulator gene, LYST. It results in defective membrane targeting of the proteins present in secretory lysosomes, and it is associated with a variety of features, including a lymphoproliferative syndrome with hemophagocytosis. The murine equivalent of CHS, beige mice, present similar characteristics but do not develop the lymphoproliferative syndrome. We show herein that CTLA-4 is present in enlarged, abnormal vesicles in CHS T cells and is not properly expressed at the cell surface after T cell activation, whereas its surface expression is not impaired. It is therefore proposed that the defective surface expression of CTLA-4 by CHS T cells is involved in the generation of lymphoproliferative disease. This observation may provide insight into the role of CTLA-4 in humans.

Two spontaneous mutant beige rats, with phenotypes resembling human Chediak- Higashi syndrome (CHS), were found independently in two inbred strains. Both beige mutations were identified to be recessive alleles in the Lyst locus on rat chromosome 17 and the alleles were denoted Lyst(bg) and Lyst(bg-Kyo). As it is almost impossible to discriminate these mutations phenotypically, we developed an allele-specific genotyping method for the Lyst gene. The nested PCR amplification was followed by restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP) analysis. By this method, we could discriminate the mutant Lyst(bg), Lyst(bg-Kyo) alleles, and the normal Lyst allele, easily and accurately.

An inheritable bleeding disorder with light coat color caused by an autosomal recessive gene has been reported in a population of Japanese black cattle. The disease has been diagnosed as Chediak-Higashi Syndrome (CHS) of cattle which correspond to a human inheritable disorder caused by mutation in LYST gene. To characterize the molecular lesion causing CHS in cattle, cDNAs encoding bovine LYST were isolated from a bovine brain cDNA library. The nucleotide and deduced amino acid sequences of bovine LYST had 89.6 and 90.2% identity with those of the human LYST gene, respectively. In order to identify the mutation within the LYST gene causing CHS in cattle, cDNA fragments of the LYST gene were amplified from an affected animal by RT-PCR and their nucleotide sequences were completely determined. Notably, a nucleotide substitution of A to G transition, resulting in an amino acid substitution of histidine to arginine (H2015R) was identified in the affected animal. The presence of the substitution was completely corresponding with the occurrence of the CHS phenotype among 105 members of pedigrees of the Japanese black cattle and no cattle of other populations had this substitution. These findings strongly suggested that H2015R is the causative mutation in CHS of Japanese black cattle.

Chediak-Higashi syndrome (CHS) is a rare autosomal recessive disorder in which an immune deficiency occurs in association with pigmentation abnormalities. Most patients who do not undergo bone marrow transplantation die of a lymphoproliferative syndrome, though some patients with CHS have a relatively milder clinical course of the disease. The large size of the LYST gene, defective in CHS, has made it difficult to screen for mutations in a large number of patients. Only 8 mutations have been identified so far, and all lead to a truncated LYST protein. We conducted protein truncation tests on this gene in 8 patients with CHS. Different LYST mutations were identified in all subjects through this approach, strengthening the observation of a high frequency of truncated LYST proteins as the genetic cause of CHS.

LYST is a large cytosolic protein that influences the biogenesis of lysosome-related organelles, and mutation of the encoding gene, LYST, can cause Chediak-Higashi syndrome. Recently, Lyst-mutant mice were recognized to also exhibit an iris disease resembling exfoliation syndrome, a common cause of glaucoma in humans. Here, Lyst-mutant iris phenotypes were used in a search for genes that influence Lyst pathways. In a candidate gene-driven approach, albino Lyst-mutant mice homozygous for a mutation in Tyr, whose product is key to melanin synthesis within melanosomes, exhibited complete rescue of Lyst-mutant iris phenotypes. In a genetic background-driven approach using a DBA/2J strain of congenic mice, an interval containing Tyrp1 enhanced Lyst-dependent iris phenotypes. Thus, both experimental approaches implicated the melanosome, an organelle that is a potential source of oxidative stress, as contributing to the disease phenotype. Confirming an association with oxidative damage, Lyst mutation resulted in genetic context-sensitive changes in iris lipid hydroperoxide levels, being lowest in albino and highest in DBA/2J mice. Surprisingly, the DBA/2J genetic background also exposed a late-onset neurodegenerative phenotype involving cerebellar Purkinje-cell degeneration. These results identify an association between oxidative damage to lipid membranes and the severity of Lyst-mutant phenotypes, revealing a new mechanism that contributes to pathophysiology involving LYST.

Peripheral neuropathy (PN) has been reported in idiopathic and hereditary forms of parkinsonism, but the pathogenic mechanisms are unclear and likely heterogeneous. Levodopa-induced vitamin B12 deficiency has been discussed as a causal factor of PN in idiopathic Parkinson's disease, but peripheral nervous system involvement might also be a consequence of the underlying neurodegenerative process. Occurrence of PN with parkinsonism has been associated with a panel of mitochondrial cytopathies, more frequently related to a nuclear gene defect and mainly polymerase gamma (POLG1) gene. Parkin (PARK2) gene mutations are responsible for juvenile parkinsonism, and possible peripheral nervous system involvement has been reported. Rarely, an association of parkinsonism with PN may be encountered in other neurodegenerative diseases such as fragile X-associated tremor and ataxia syndrome related to premutation CGG repeat expansion in the fragile X mental retardation (FMR1) gene, Machado-Joseph disease related to an abnormal CAG repeat expansion in ataxin-3 (ATXN3) gene, Kufor-Rakeb syndrome caused by mutations in ATP13A2 gene, or in hereditary systemic disorders such as Gaucher disease due to mutations in the β-glucocerebrosidase (GBA) gene and Chediak-Higashi syndrome due to LYST gene mutations. This article reviews conditions in which PN may coexist with parkinsonism.

One of the colors of mink is Aleutian (aa)-a specific gun-metal gray pigmentation of the fur-commonly used in combination with other color loci to generate popular colors such as Violet (aammpp) and Sapphire (aapp). The Aleutian color allele is a manifestation of mink Chédiak-Higashi syndrome (CHS), which has been described in humans and several other species. As with forms of CHS in other species, we report that the mink CHS is linked to the lysosomal trafficking regulator ( LYST ) gene. Furthermore, we have identified a base deletion (c.9468delC) in exon 40 of LYST, which causes a frameshift and virtually terminates the LYST product prematurely (p.Leu3156Phefs*37). We investigated the blood parameters of three wild-type mink and three CHS mink. No difference in the platelet number between the two groups was observed, but an accumulation of platelets between the groups appears different when collagen is used as a coagulant. Microscopic analysis of peripheral blood indicates giant inclusions in the neutrophils of the Aleutian mink types. Molecular findings at the LYST locus enable the development of genetic tests for analyzing the color selection in American mink.

Chediak-Higashi syndrome (CHS) is an inherited immunodeficiency disease characterized by giant lysosomes and impaired leukocyte degranulation. CHS results from mutations in the lysosomal trafficking regulator (LYST) gene, which encodes a 425-kD cytoplasmic protein of unknown function. The goal of this study was to identify proteins that interact with LYST as a first step in understanding how LYST modulates lysosomal exocytosis. Fourteen cDNA fragments, covering the entire coding domain of LYST, were used as baits to screen five human cDNA libraries by a yeast two-hybrid method, modified to allow screening in the activation and the binding domain, three selectable markers, and more stringent confirmation procedures. Five of the interactions were confirmed by an in vitro binding assay. Twenty-one proteins that interact with LYST were identified in yeast two-hybrid screens. Four interactions, confirmed directly, were with proteins important in vesicular transport and signal transduction (the SNARE-complex protein HRS, 14-3-3, and casein kinase II). On the basis of protein interactions, LYST appears to function as an adapter protein that may juxtapose proteins that mediate intracellular membrane fusion reactions. The pathologic manifestations observed in CHS patients and in mice with the homologous mutation beige suggest that understanding the role of LYST may be relevant to the treatment of not only CHS but also of diseases such as asthma, urticaria, and lupus, as well as to the molecular dissection of the CHS-associated cancer predisposition.

The murine beige mutant phenotype and the human Chediak-Higashi syndrome are caused by mutations in the murine Lyst (lysosomal trafficking regulator) gene and the human CHS gene, respectively. In this report we have analyzed a novel murine mutant Lyst allele, called Lyst(bg-grey), that had been found in an ENU mutation screen and named grey because of the grey coat color of affected mice. The phenotype caused by the Lyst(bg-grey) mutation was inherited in a recessive fashion. Melanosomes of melanocytes associated with hair follicles and the choroid layer of the eye, as well as melanosomes in the neural tube-derived pigment epithelium of the retina, were larger and irregularly shaped in homozygous mutants compared with those of wild-type controls. Secretory vesicles in dermal mast cells of the mutant skin were enlarged as well. Test crosses with beige homozygous mutant mice (Lyst(bg)) showed that double heterozygotes (Lyst(bg)/Lyst(bg-grey)) were phenotypically indistinguishable from either homozygous parent, demonstrating that the ENU mutation was an allele of the murine Lyst gene. RT-PCR analyses revealed the skipping of exon 25 in Lyst(bg-grey) mutants, which is predicted to cause a missense D2399E mutation and the loss of the following 77 amino acids encoded by exon 25 but leave the C-terminal end of the protein intact. Analysis of the genomic Lyst locus around exon 25 showed that the splice donor at the end of exon 25 showed a T-to-C transition point mutation. Western blot analysis suggests that the Lyst(bg-grey) mutation causes instability of the LYST protein. Because the phenotype of Lyst(bg) and Lyst(bg-grey) mutants is indistinguishable, at least with respect to melanosomes and secretory granules in mast cells, the Lyst(bg-grey) mutation defines a critical region for the stability of the murine LYST protein.

Chediak-Higashi syndrome is a genetic disorder caused by mutations in a gene encoding a protein named LYST in humans ("lysosomal trafficking regulator") or Beige in mice. A prominent feature of this disease is the accumulation of enlarged lysosome-related granules in a variety of cells. The genome of Dictyostelium discoideum contains six genes encoding proteins that are related to LYST/Beige in amino acid sequence, and disruption of one of these genes, lvsA (large volume sphere), results in profound defects in cytokinesis. To better understand the function of this family of proteins in membrane trafficking, we have analyzed mutants disrupted in lvsA, lvsB, lvsC, lvsD, lvsE, and lvsF. Of all these, only lvsA and lvsB mutants displayed interesting phenotypes in our assays. lvsA-null cells exhibited defects in phagocytosis and contained abnormal looking contractile vacuole membranes. Loss of LvsB, the Dictyostelium protein most similar to LYST/Beige, resulted in the formation of enlarged vesicles that by multiple criteria appeared to be acidic lysosomes. The rates of endocytosis, phagocytosis, and fluid phase exocytosis were normal in lvsB-null cells. Also, the rates of processing and the efficiency of targeting of lysosomal alpha-mannosidase were normal, although lvsB mutants inefficiently retained alpha-mannosidase, as well as two other lysosomal cysteine proteinases. Finally, results of pulse-chase experiments indicated that an increase in fusion rates accounted for the enlarged lysosomes in lvsB-null cells, suggesting that LvsB acts as a negative regulator of fusion. Our results support the notion that LvsB/LYST/Beige function in a similar manner to regulate lysosome biogenesis.

Chediak-Higashi syndrome (CHS) is a rare autosomal recessive disorder (incidence around 1 in 106 births), characterised by a complex immunologic defects, reduced pigmentation, and presence of giant granules in many different cell types. It most likely results from defective organellar trafficking or protein sorting. The causative gene (LYST) has recently been identified and shown to be homologous to the beige locus in the mouse. CHS has always been reported associated with premature-termination-codon mutations in both alleles of LYST. We report a unique patient with CHS, who was homozygous for a stop codon in the LYST gene on chromosome 1 and who had a normal 46,XY karyotype. The mother was found to be a carrier of the mutation, whereas the father had two normal LYST alleles. Non-paternity was excluded by the analysis of microsatellite markers from different chromosomes. The results of 13 informative microsatellite markers spanning the entire chromosome 1 revealed that the proband had a maternal isodisomy of chromosome 1 encompassing the LYST mutation. The proband's clinical presentation also confirms the absence of imprinted genes on chromosome 1.

Background. Chediak-Higashi syndrome (CHS) is a rare, autosomal recessive disorder characterized by oculocutaneous albinism, immunodeficiency, coagulopathy and late-onset, progressive neurological dysfunction. It also has an "accelerated phase" characterized by hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis (HLH). The disease is caused by mutations in the CHS1/LYST gene located on chromosome 1, which affects lysosome morphology and function. We report the case of an African-American child with CHS in Case. This 16-month old African-American girl presented with fever and lethargy. The proband had pale skin compared to her parents, with light brown eyes, silvery hair and massive hepatosplenomegaly. Her laboratory evaluation was remarkable for pancytopenia, high serum ferritin and an elevated LDH. Bone marrow aspirate revealed large inclusions in granulocytes and erythrophagocytosis consistent with HLH. Genetic evaluation revealed two novel nonsense mutations in the CHS1 gene: c.3622C > T (p.Q1208X) and c.11002G > T (p.E3668X). Conclusions. Our patient is one of the few cases of CHS reported in the African American population. We identified 2 nonsense mutations in the CHS1 gene, the first mutation analysis published of an African-American child with Chediak-Higashi Syndrome. These two mutations predict a severe phenotype and thus identification of these mutations has an important clinical significance in CHS.
