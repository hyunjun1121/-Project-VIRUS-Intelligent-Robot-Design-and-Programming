What is the generic name of the Xofluza?

Baloxavir marboxil (Xofluza<sup>®</sup>; hereafter referred to as baloxavir), the prodrug of baloxavir acid, is a first-in-class, small molecule inhibitor of the polymerase acidic (PA) protein subunit of the influenza virus polymerase complex. Baloxavir (after conversion to baloxavir acid) acts to block influenza virus replication by inhibiting the cap-dependent endonuclease activity of the PA protein. Taken orally as a single dose, baloxavir is approved in the USA for the treatment of acute uncomplicated influenza in patients ≥ 12 years of age who have been symptomatic for ≤ 48 h. Data from randomized, double-blind, placebo- and oseltamivir-controlled phase III trials have shown that baloxavir is efficacious in improving influenza symptoms both in otherwise healthy adolescents and adults and in those at high risk of influenza complications, displaying similar efficacy to that of oseltamivir. Furthermore, there is evidence that baloxavir can reduce influenza viral load more rapidly than oseltamivir. Baloxavir has activity against influenza A and B viruses (including strains resistant to neuraminidase inhibitors) and is well tolerated. Evidence of the emergence and likely human-to-human transmission of variant viruses with reduced susceptibility to baloxavir highlights the importance of monitoring and surveillance for changes in influenza virus drug susceptibility patterns. However, currently available evidence suggests that baloxavir, with the benefits of a single oral dose regimen, provides a useful alternative to neuraminidase inhibitors for the treatment of acute uncomplicated influenza in adolescents and adults.

For the first time in nearly 20 years there is a new class of antiviral drug for influenza. The latest approved antiviral is baloxavir marboxil (trade name, Xofluza) which targets the endonuclease function of the viral PA polymerase subunit and prevents the transcription of viral mRNA. The most promising aspect of this new drug is its pharmacology which allows for effective treatment of influenza A or B virus infection with just a single dose. A clinical trial showed greater reductions in viral loads with baloxavir marboxil treatment compared with oseltamivir, although no difference in the time to alleviation of symptoms between these two drugs. With this new class of influenza drug comes exciting prospects for combination therapy with the neuraminidase inhibitors which may help to abate concerns about the development of resistance.

Baloxavir marboxil (Xofluza™; baloxavir) is an oral cap-dependent endonuclease inhibitor that has been developed by Roche and Shionogi. The drug blocks influenza virus proliferation by inhibiting the initiation of mRNA synthesis. In February 2018, baloxavir received its first global approval in Japan for the treatment of influenza A or B virus infections. Phase III development is underway in the USA, EU and other countries for this indication. This article summarized the milestones in the development of baloxavir leading to this first global approval for influenza A or B virus infections.

Baloxavir marboxil (Xofluza), an antiviral flu treatment, has now been approved to prevent influenza.Patients should avoid taking calcium, aluminum, or magnesium products while receiving baloxavir as this will lead to a loss of antiviral efficacy.

Arikayce (amikacin liposome inhalation suspension) for <i>Mycobacterium avium</i> complex lung disease; Xofluza (baloxavir marboxil) for acute uncomplicated influenza; and Nuzyra (omadacycline) for community-acquired bacterial pneumonia and/or acute bacterial skin and skin structure infections.

The number of global clinical trials including Japan is increasing but still much lower than those including the USA and Europe. The regulatory requirements for clinical trials have been harmonized among Japan, USA, and Europe, and the quality of clinical trials is kept high in these regions. Xofluza (baloxavir marboxil) for influenza approved in Japan under the SAKIGAKE Designation System is a good example of clinical trials including Japan. To include Japan in more global clinical trials, stakeholders should work more collaboratively, and increase the perception that clinical trials can be conducted appropriately and efficiently in Japan. Further measures for better management of clinical trials should also be developed. These would ultimately lead to improved benefits for patients with timely access to new drugs.

Seasonal influenza infections are associated with an estimated 250-500 000 deaths annually. Resistance to the antiviral M2 ion-channel inhibitors has largely invalidated their clinical utility. Resistance to neuraminidase inhibitors has also been observed in several influenza A virus (IAV) strains. These data have prompted research on inhibitors that target the cap-snatching endonuclease activity of the polymerase acidic protein (PA). Baloxavir marboxil (Xofluza®), recently approved for clinical use, inhibits cap-snatching endonuclease. Resistance to Xofluza® has been reported in both in vitro systems and in the clinic. An X-ray crystallographic screening campaign of a fragment library targeting IAV endonuclease identified 5-chloro-3-hydroxypyridin-2(1H)-one as a bimetal chelating agent at the active site. We have reported the structure-activity relationships for 3-hydroxypyridin-2(1H)-ones and 3-hydroxyquinolin-2(1H)-ones as endonuclease inhibitors. These studies identified two distinct binding modes associated with inhibition of this enzyme that are influenced by the presence of substituents at the 5- and 6-positions of 3-hydroxypyridin-2(1H)-ones. Herein we report the structure-activity relationships associated with various para-substituted 5-phenyl derivatives of 6-(p-fluorophenyl)-3-hydroxypyridin-2(1H)-ones and the effect of using naphthyl, benzyl, and naphthylmethyl groups as alternatives to the p-fluorophenyl substituent on their activity as endonuclease inhibitors.

The smallest of all the pathogens, viruses, have continuously been the foremost strange microorganisms. Viral infections can cause extreme sicknesses as evidenced by the HIV/AIDS widespread or the later Ebola or Zika episodes. Apprehensive framework distortions are also regularly observed as consequences of numerous viral infections. Besides, numerous viral infections are of oncoviruses, which can trigger different types of cancer. Nearly every year, a modern infectious species emerges, debilitating the world population with an annihilating episode. Subsequently, there is a need to create antivirals to combat such rising infections. From the discovery of the antiviral drug Idoxuridine in 1962 to the revelation of Baloxavir marboxil (Xofluza) that was approved by the FDA in 2018, the whole process and criteria of creating antivirals have changed significantly. In this article, different auxiliary science strategies are described that can serve as a referral for therapeutic innovation.
