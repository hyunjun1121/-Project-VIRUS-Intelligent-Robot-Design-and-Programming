IDEAL_ANSWER:
- transcriptional activation is associated with a dynamic bi-modal 3d organization, whereby the genes switch autonomously from an inactive to an active compartment.
- Initially, Hox clusters are organized as single chromatin compartments containing all genes and bivalent chromatin marks. Transcriptional activation is associated with a dynamic bi-modal 3D organization, whereby the genes switch autonomously from an inactive to an active compartment.
