Accurate cell division requires the proper assembly of high-order septin structures. In fission yeast (Schizosaccharomyces pombe), Spn1-Spn4 are assembled into a primary septin ring at the division site, and the subsequent recruitment of Mid2 to the structure results in a stable septin ring. However, not much is known about the regulation of this key process. Here, we found that deletion of Spt20, a structural subunit of the Spt-Ada-Gcn5-acetyltransferase (SAGA) transcriptional activation complex, caused a severe cell separation defect. The defect was mainly due to impaired septin ring assembly, as 80% of spt20Δ cells lost septin rings at the division sites. Spt20 regulates septin ring assembly partially through the transcriptional activation of mid2(+). Spt20 also interacted with Spn2 and Mid2 in vitro and was associated with other components of the ring in vivo. Spt20 colocalized with the septin ring, but did not separate when the septin ring split. Importantly, Spt20 regulated the stability of the septin ring and was required for the recruitment of Mid2. The transcription-dependent and -independent roles of Spt20 in septin ring assembly highlight a multifaceted regulation of one process by a SAGA subunit.

The molecular organization of the yeast transcriptional coactivator Spt-Ada-Gcn5 acetyltransferase (SAGA) was analyzed by single-particle electron microscopy. Complete or partial deletion of the Sgf73 subunit disconnects the deubiquitination (DUB) module from SAGA and favors in our conditions the cleavage of the C-terminal ends of the Spt7 subunit and the loss of the Spt8 subunit. The structural comparison of the wild-type SAGA with two deletion mutants positioned the DUB module and enabled the fitting of the available atomic models. The localization of the DUB module close to Gcn5 defines a chromatin-binding interface within SAGA, which could be demonstrated by the binding of nucleosome core particles. The TATA-box binding protein (TBP)-interacting subunit Spt8 was found to be located close to the DUB but in a different domain than Spt3, also known to contact TBP. A flexible protein arm brings both subunits close enough to interact simultaneously with TBP.

NuA4 (nucleosome acetyltransferase of H4) promotes transcriptional initiation of TFIID (a complex of TBP and TBP-associated factors [TAFs])-dependent ribosomal protein genes involved in ribosome biogenesis. However, it is not clearly understood how NuA4 regulates the transcription of ribosomal protein genes. Here, we show that NuA4 is recruited to the promoters of ribosomal protein genes, such as RPS5, RPL2B, and RPS11B, for TFIID recruitment to initiate transcription, and the recruitment of NuA4 to these promoters is impaired in the absence of its Eaf1p component. Intriguingly, impaired NuA4 recruitment in a Δeaf1 strain depletes recruitment of TFIID (a TAF-dependent form of TBP) but not the TAF-independent form of TBP to the promoters of ribosomal protein genes. However, in the absence of NuA4, SAGA (Spt-Ada-Gcn5-acetyltransferase) is involved in targeting the TAF-independent form of TBP to the promoters of ribosomal protein genes for transcriptional initiation. Thus, NuA4 plays an important role in targeting TFIID to the promoters of ribosomal protein genes for transcriptional initiation in vivo. Such a function is mediated via its targeted histone acetyltransferase activity. In the absence of NuA4, ribosomal protein genes lose TFIID dependency and become SAGA dependent for transcriptional initiation. Collectively, these results provide significant insights into the regulation of ribosomal protein gene expression and, hence, ribosome biogenesis and functions.

The yeast Spt-Ada-Gcn5-acetyltransferase (SAGA) complex is a transcription coactivator that contains a histone H2B deubiquitination activity mediated by its Ubp8 subunit. Full enzymatic activity requires the formation of a quaternary complex, the deubiquitination module (DUBm) of SAGA, which is composed of Ubp8, Sus1, Sgf11, and Sgf73. The crystal structures of the DUBm have shed light on the structure/function relationship of this complex. Specifically, both Sgf11 and Sgf73 contain zinc finger domains (ZnF) that appear essential for the DUBm activity. Whereas Sgf73 N-terminal ZnF is important for DUBm stability, Sgf11 C-terminal ZnF appears to be involved in DUBm function. To further characterize the role of these two zinc fingers, we have solved their structure by NMR. We show that, contrary to the previously reported structures, Sgf73 ZnF adopts a C2H2 coordination with unusual tautomeric forms for the coordinating histidines. We further report that the Sgf11 ZnF, but not the Sgf73 ZnF, binds to nucleosomal DNA with a binding interface composed of arginine residues located within the ZnF α-helix. Mutational analyses both in vitro and in vivo provide evidence for the functional relevance of our structural observations. The combined interpretation of our results leads to an uncommon ZnF-DNA interaction between the SAGA DUBm and nucleosomes, thus providing further functional insights into SAGA's epigenetic modulation of the chromatin structure.

Protein complexes involved in epigenetic regulation of transcription have evolved as molecular strategies to face environmental stress in plants. SAGA (Spt-Ada-Gcn5 Acetyltransferase) is a transcriptional co-activator complex that regulates numerous cellular processes through the coordination of multiple post-translational histone modifications, including acetylation, deubiquitination, and chromatin recognition. The diverse functions of the SAGA complex involve distinct modules that are highly conserved between yeast, flies, and mammals. In this review, the composition of the SAGA complex in plants is described and its role in gene expression regulation under stress conditions summarized. Some of these proteins are likely involved in the regulation of the inducible expression of genes under light, cold, drought, salt, and iron stress, although the functions of several of its components remain unknown.
