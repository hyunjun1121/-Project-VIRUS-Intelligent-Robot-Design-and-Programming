Which enzyme is deficient in Wolman disease?

Although only a small proportion of cholesterol in the body is esterified, in several diseases marked expansion of the esterified cholesterol (EC) pool occurs. These include Wolman disease (WD) and Cholesteryl Ester Storage Disease (CESD) which both result from mutations in LIPA, the gene that encodes lysosomal acid lipase (LAL). The respective contributions that our three cholesterol esterifying enzymes make to EC production, especially in disorders like CESD, are not well defined. The current studies represent a detailed exploration of our earlier findings in young male LAL-deficient mice also missing sterol O-acyltransferase 2 (SOAT2, also called ACAT2). Here we show that, even as they aged, male and female Lal<sup>-/-</sup>: Soat2<sup>- /-</sup> mice, compared to Lal<sup>-/-</sup>: Soat2<sup>+/+</sup> littermates, had appreciably less hepatomegaly as well as a marked reduction in the level of sequestration of EC, in liver transaminase activities, and in hepatic mRNA expression levels for markers of inflammation. Loss of SOAT2 function also dramatically curtailed EC entrapment in the small intestine of the LAL-deficient mice. Together, these data imply that SOAT2 inhibition, if applied concurrently with enzyme replacement therapy for LAL deficiency, may blunt the re-esterification of newly released unesterified cholesterol thereby improving clinical outcomes.

Wolman disease is characterized by severe diarrhea and malnutrition leading to death during infancy. Lysosomal acid lipase deficiency is the cause of the symptoms and signs. It is inherited in an autosomal recessive manner. All Wolman disease patients have adrenal gland calcification. Previous therapeutic attempts have failed to provide remission. We report successful long-term bone marrow engraftment in a patient with Wolman disease resulting in continued normalization of peripheral leukocyte lysosomal acid lipase enzyme activity. Diarrhea is no longer present. Now, at 4 years of age, this patient is gaining developmental milestones. Cholesterol and triglyceride levels are normal. Liver function is normal. This is the first long-term continued remission reported for Wolman disease.

Cholesteryl ester storage disease (CESD, OMIM #278000) and Wolman disease (OMIM #278000) are autosomal recessive lysosomal storage disorders caused by a deficient activity of lysosomal acid lipase (cholesteryl ester hydrolase, LAL). Human lysosomal acid lipase is essential for the metabolism of cholesteryl esters and triglycerides. In Wolman disease, LAL activity is usually absent, whereas CESD usually presents some residual LAL activity. In infants, poor weight gain, massive hepatosplenomegaly, calcified adrenal glands (present about 2/3 of the time), vomiting, diarrhea and failure to thrive are indicative of Wolman disease. The clinical picture is more variable in CESD. Hepatomegaly and/or elevation of liver transaminases are almost always present. Hepatic steatosis often leads to fibrosis and cirrhosis. Other signs often include splenomegaly, high total cholesterol and LDL-cholesterol, elevated triglycerides, and low HDL-cholesterol. The diagnosis of LAL deficiency requires clinical experience and specialized laboratory tests. The diagnosis is based on finding deficient activity of acid lipase and/or molecular tests. Pilot screening projects using dried blood spot testing in 1) children with atypical fatty liver disease in the absence of overweight, 2) patients with dyslipidaemia and presence of hepatomegaly and/or elevated transaminases, 3) newborns/neonates with hepatomegaly and abdominal distension/failure to thrive/elevated transaminases are currently underway. Early diagnosis is particularly important for the enzyme replacement therapy. Human trials with recombinant LAL are currently ongoing, raising the prospect for specific correction of LAL deficiency in this progressive and often debilitating disorder.

Pyrenemethyl laurate (PMLes), a fluorogenic substrate for determining in vitro lipase activity [Nègre, Salvayre, Dagan and Gatt (1989) Biochim. Biophys. Acta 1006, 84-88], has been administered to cultured lymphoblastoid cells from normal subjects and from a patient affected with Wolman disease, which is characterized by a deficiency of lysosomal acid lipase. The intracellular degradation of PMLes was dependent on the mode of administration of the substrate into the cells, and occurred by two separate pathways involving lysosomal and extra-lysosomal hydrolases. PMLes incorporated into LDL was taken up by normal lymphoblastoid cells through the apolipoprotein-B/E-receptor-mediated pathway and degraded in the lysosomal compartment, as suggested by the degradation block in Wolman cells. In contrast, when PMLes dissolved in 2% dimethyl sulphoxide was added directly to the culture medium, its hydrolysis was similar in lymphoblastoid cells from controls and from patients affected with Wolman disease, neutral lipid storage disease or familial hypercholesterolaemia. This suggested that the administered PMLes was degraded by a non-lysosomal enzyme which is not deficient in Wolman cells. This enzyme also differs from the neutral lipase system which is deficient in lymphoblastoid cells from patients with neutral lipid storage disease. When pyrenemethanol was administered directly to the cell culture, it was only poorly acylated and was rapidly released into the culture medium. These results and the fluorescence properties of PMLes ('monomeric' emission in a hydrophobic environment and 'excimeric' emission in a hydrophilic environment) and pyrenemethanol ('monomeric' emission in a hydrophilic environment) allowed us to design a 'direct reading' procedure by monitoring (without any lipid extraction) the fluorescence of intact living cells and that of the culture medium during pulse-chase experiments. This method allowed the direct evaluation of the time course of in situ degradation of PMLes. In pulse-chase experiments with LDL-PMLes, the fluorescence of normal cells decreased relatively rapidly with time whereas the fluorescence of the culture medium increased concomitantly. With Wolman cells, the cellular fluorescence decreased only very slightly, whereas that of the culture medium remained at the basal level; this demonstrates the catabolic block in intact living cells from patients with Wolman disease. In vitro degradation of PMLes indicated the existence of two PMLes-degrading enzymes in lymphoblastoid cell homogenates: one is the acid lipase which is involved in PMLes degradation in the lysosomal compartment (and is deficient in Wolman cells), while the second is a cytoplasmic enzyme (not deficient in Wolman cells).

Previous studies have shown that cultured fibroblasts derived from patients with genetic defects in lysosomal acid lipase (i. e. the Wolman Syndrome and Cholesteryl Ester Storage Disease) are defective in their ability to hydrolyze the cholesteryl esters contained in plasma low density lipoprotein (LDL). As a result, these mutant cells show a reduced responsiveness to the regulatory actions of LDL, as evidenced by a decreased LDL-mediated suppression of the activity of 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase and by a decreased LDL-mediated activation of cellular cholesteryl ester formation. In the current studies, the Wolman Syndrome and Cholesteryl Ester Storage Disease cells were grown in the same Petri dish with mutant fibroblasts derived from a patient with the homozygous form of Familial Hypercholesterolemia. Whereas pure monolayers of either the Familial Hypercholesterolemia cells (lacking cell surface LDL receptors) or the acid lipase-deficient cells (lacking cholesteryl ester hydrolase activity) responded poorly to LDL, the mixed monolayers developed lipoprotein responsiveness as measured by an enhancement of both LDL-mediated suppression of 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase activity and LDL-mediated stimulation of cholesteryl ester formation. This effect was shown to result from the release of the lysosomal acid lipase from the Familial Hypercholesterolemia homozygote cells into the culture medium and its subsequent uptake by the acid lipase-deficient cells. The acquisition of this acid lipase activity enhanced the ability of the Wolman Syndrome and Cholesteryl Ester Storage Disease cells to respond to the lipoprotein by suppression of 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase and activation of cellular cholesteryl ester formation. These data emphasize the importance of the lysosomal acid lipase in the cellular metabolism of LDL cholesteryl esters and, in addition, demonstrate that delivery of this enzyme to genetically deficient cells can enhance the regulatory response to the lipoprotein.

Human lysosomal acid lipase/cholesteryl ester hydrolase (hLAL) is essential for the intralysosomal metabolism of cholesteryl esters and triglycerides taken up by receptor-mediated endocytosis of lipoprotein particles. The key role of the enzyme in intracellular lipid homeostasis is illustrated by two lysosomal storage diseases inherited as autosomal recessive traits. Wolman disease, associated with deficient hLAL activity, leads to massive intracellular substrate accumulation and is always fatal in early infancy. Cholesteryl ester storage disease (CESD), in contrast, is characterized by very low levels of enzymic activity sufficient to allow survival of the affected patients into adulthood. In order to elucidate the underlying molecular defects in Wolman disease, we have characterized the hLAL gene in two female Wolman patients of German and Turkish origin by SSCP and DNA sequence analysis. Our results demonstrate that the German proband was compound heterozygous for an 8-bp deletion in exon 3 and a 2-bp deletion in exon 4 of the hLAL gene. These frameshift mutations lead to protein truncation at amino acid positions 24 and 116 and to complete loss of hydrolytic activity. The Turkish proband, in contrast, was homozygous for a G(1064)-->T substitution in exon 10 of the hLAL gene which converts the completely conserved glycine (GGG) residue at position 321 of the mature enzyme to tryptophan (TGG). In vitro expression of the hLAL(Gly(321)-->Trp) cDNA construct revealed that the amino acid replacement results in a more than 99% reduction of neutral lipid hydrolysis. The mutations provide new insights into the molecular basis of Wolman disease which is apparently more heterogeneous at the genetic level than cholesteryl ester storage disease.-Lohse, P., S. Maas, P. Lohse, A. C. Sewell, O. P. van Diggelen, and D. Seidel. Molecular defects underlying Wolman disease appear to be more heterogeneous than those resulting in cholesteryl ester storage disease.

Wolman disease (WD) is a rare lysosomal storage disorder that is caused by mutations in the LIPA gene encoding lysosomal acid lipase (LAL). Deficiency in LAL function causes accumulation of cholesteryl esters and triglycerides in lysosomes. Fatality usually occurs within the first year of life. While an enzyme replacement therapy has recently become available, there is currently no small-molecule drug treatment for WD. We have generated induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) from two WD patient dermal fibroblast lines and subsequently differentiated them into neural stem cells (NSCs). The WD NSCs exhibited the hallmark disease phenotypes of neutral lipid accumulation, severely deficient LAL activity, and increased LysoTracker dye staining. Enzyme replacement treatment dramatically reduced the WD phenotype in these cells. In addition, δ-tocopherol (DT) and hydroxypropyl-beta-cyclodextrin (HPBCD) significantly reduced lysosomal size in WD NSCs, and an enhanced effect was observed in DT/HPBCD combination therapy. The results demonstrate that these WD NSCs are valid cell-based disease models with characteristic disease phenotypes that can be used to evaluate drug efficacy and screen compounds. DT and HPBCD both reduce LysoTracker dye staining in WD cells. The cells may be used to further dissect the pathology of WD, evaluate compound efficacy, and serve as a platform for high-throughput drug screening to identify new compounds for therapeutic development.

No published case of Wolman's disease has described the prenatal sonographic findings. We present a case in which a third-trimester sonographic examination demonstrated fetal hepatomegaly and bilateral adrenal echogenicity suggestive of diffuse calcification. Wolman's disease, also known as lysosomal acid lipase (LIPA) deficiency, is a rare autosomal-recessive disorder characterized by complete absence of the LIPA enzyme. The diagnosis of Wolman's disease was made postnatally by biochemical testing, which indicated absence of LIPA enzyme activity and gene sequencing, which confirmed homozygosity for the G66V mutation within the LIPA gene. © 2017 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

Lysosomal acid lipase deficiency is an autosomal recessive metabolic disease with a wide range of severity from Wolman Disease to Cholesterol Ester Storage Disease. Recently enzyme replacement therapy with sebelipase alpha has been approved by drug agencies for treatment of this lysosomal disease. Ezetimibe is an azetidine derivative which blocks Niemann Pick C1-Like 1 Protein; as its consequence, plasmatic concentration of low density lipoproteins and other apoB-containing lipoproteins, that are the substrate of lysosomal acid lipase, are decreased. Furthermore, ezetimibe acts by blocking inflammasome activation which is the cause of liver fibrosis in steatohepatitis and in lysosomal storage diseases. Two patients with Cholesterol Ester Storage Disease were treated with ezetimibe for 9 years and a third patients for 10 years. Treatment was supplemented with low dose of atorvastatin in the first two patients during the last 6 years. All patients showed a significant reduction of alanine aminotransferase, cholesterol and triglyceride. Furthermore, no progression of liver fibrosis was demonstrated. In this observational case series, ezetimibe is effective, safe, and sustainable treatment for lysosomal acid lipase deficiency. Further studies are warranted to demonstrate that ezetimibe is an alternative therapy to enzyme replacement therapy.

Cholesteryl ester storage disease (CESD) and Wolman disease (WD) are both autosomal recessive disorders associated with reduced activity and genetic defects of lysosomal acid lipase (LAL). The strikingly more severe course of WD is caused by genetic defects of LAL that leave no residual enzymatic activity. Mutations at the exon 8/intron 8 transition of the LAL gene have been identified in several CESD and WD patients and are responsible for the manifestation of the disease. We have determined the genetic defect in a 3-month-old boy of African origin affected by WD. No enzymatic activity of the lysosomal acid lipase was detectable in white blood cells and cultured fibroblasts. Analysis of his LAL cDNA and genomic DNA revealed that he was homozygous for a mutation at position -3 of the exon 8 splice donor site. A C-->T transition leads to a nonsense codon and to a premature termination of the LAL protein at amino acid 277. Due to this mutation, a shorter LAL mRNA species was also generated that lacked exon 8 and was deficient of the nonsense codon. As a consequence, the protein synthesis proceeded to the natural termination codon, but the enzyme generated had an internal deletion of 24 amino acids (254-277) and was also inactive. These findings, together with our previous observations when analyzing the mutations in WD and CESD patients lead to the conclusion that the more severe WD is due to mutations that absolutely abolish lysosomal acid lipase (LAL) enzyme activity and the cholesteryl ester storage disease phenotype is due to mutations that allow some residual LAL activity to be manifested.

Lysosomal acid lipase (LAL), encoded by the LIPA gene, is an essential lysosomal enzyme that hydrolyzes cholesteryl ester and triglyceride delivered to the lysosome. This review highlights the novel pathophysiological role of LAL, the functional genomic discoveries of LIPA as a risk locus for coronary heart diseases (CHD), and the clinical advance in therapies for LAL deficiency. The essential role of LAL in lipid metabolism has been confirmed in human and mice with LAL deficiency. In humans, loss-of-function mutations of LIPA cause rare lysosomal disorders, Wolman disease, and cholesteryl ester storage disease, in which LAL enzyme replacement therapy has shown significant benefits in a phase 3 clinical trial. Recent studies have revealed the role of LAL-mediated lysosomal lipolysis in regulating macrophage M2 polarization, lipid mediator production, VLDL secretion, lysosomal function and autophagy, extracellular degradation of aggregated-LDL, and adipose tissue lipolysis. Genome-wide association studies and functional genomic studies have identified LIPA as a risk locus for CHD, but the causal variants and mechanisms remain to be determined. Despite years of research, our understanding of LAL is incomplete. Future studies will continue to focus on the key pathophysiological functions of LAL in health and diseases including CHD.

Deficiency of lysosomal acid lipase (LAL) causes Wolman disease and cholesterol ester storage disease. With the recent introduction of enzyme replacement therapy to manage LAL deficiency comes the need for a reliable assay of LAL enzymatic activity that can be applied to dried blood spots (DBS). We prepared and tested a library of analogs of palmitoyl 4-methylumbelifferyl esters to find a highly active and specific substrate for LAL in DBS. The LAL assay was optimized leading to both LC-MS/MS and fluorometric assay of LAL. We tested the new assay on DBS from healthy and LAL-deficient patients. The ester formed between palmitic acid and 4-propyl-8-methyl-7-hydroxycoumarin (P-PMHC) was found to be >98% selective for LAL in DBS based on the sensitivity of its activity to the LAL-specific inactivator Lalistat-2 and the fact that the activity was close to zero using DBS from patients previously shown to be LAL-deficient. Use of P-PMHC and heavy isotope-labeled internal standard with optimized assay conditions led to an approximately 2-fold increase in the specific activity of LAL compared with the previously reported LAL assay. Patients deficient in LAL were readily distinguished from normal persons with the new LAL assay using UPLC-MS/MS or fluorometric assay platforms. The new assay can measure LAL in DBS with a single measurement compared with the previous method involving 2 assays done in parallel.

Lysosomal acid lipase (LAL) is a hydrolase essential for the intracellular degradation of cholesteryl esters and triglycerides. We previously reported a rat model of Wolman's disease (Wolman rat) that is deficient for LAL activity. In this study, we cloned rat LAL (RLAL) cDNA and investigated abnormal LAL gene expression in the Wolman rat. We cloned the RLAL gene from a cDNA library made from normal rat liver mRNA using the human LAL cDNA as a probe, subcloned the RLAL cDNA into pBlueScript vector, and sequenced it. Next, we constructed a cDNA library from a Wolman rat liver, and used the RLAL cDNA as a probe to isolate the Wolman RLAL cDNA for comparison. The normal RLAL cDNA contains 3150 bp including an 1194 bp open reading frame and three poly A signals at the 3' end. The deduced amino acid sequence contained 397 amino acids, showed 79.9% homology with human LAL, and had the same functional domains at the same sites as human LAL. Northern blot analysis revealed that the RLAL mRNA from normal rat was 3.2 kb in length, while the RLAL mRNA from Wolman rat was only 1.4 kb. Nucleotide sequence analysis showed that Wolman rat LAL cDNA had the same sequence as a RLAL cDNA from the 5'-untranslated region to nt 1101, followed by a 60 bp replacement from nt 1102 to nt 1161 with poly A signal and a 3' 1.8 kb deletion. The deduced amino acid sequence demonstrated the substitution of 367Ile to Asn, 368Pro to stop codon, and deletion of the C-terminal 29 amino acids. Genomic Southern blot analysis disclosed a large deletion at the 3' end of the gene. These results identify the molecular defect in the Wolman RLAL, and suggest that the C-terminus of RLAL is essential for the activity and/or stability of the enzyme.
