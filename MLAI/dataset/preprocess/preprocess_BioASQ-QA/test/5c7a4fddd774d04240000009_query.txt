How rare are CTCs (circulating tumour cells) in the plasma of patients?

This study reports a microfluidic-based optical sensing device for label-free detection of circulating tumor cells (CTCs), a rare cell species in blood circulation. Based on the metabolic features of cancer cells, live CTCs can be quantified indirectly through their lactic acid production. Compared with the conventional schemes for CTC detection, this label-free approach could prevent the biological bias due to the heterogeneity of the surface antigens on cancer cells. In this study, a microfluidic device was proposed to generate uniform water-in-oil cell-encapsulating micro-droplets, followed by the fluorescence-based optical detection of lactic acid produced within the micro-droplets. To test its feasibility to quantify cancer cells, experiments were carried out. Results showed that the detection signals were proportional to the number of cancer cells within the micro-droplets, whereas such signals were insensitive to the existence and number of leukocytes within. To further demonstrate its feasibility for cancer cell detection, the cancer cells with known cell number in a cell suspension was detected based on the method. Results revealed that there was no significant difference between the detected number and the real number of cancer cells. As a whole, the proposed method opens up a new route to detect live CTCs in a label-free manner.

This work demonstrated an effective strategy for the capture, identification and determination of multiple types of circulating tumor cells (CTCs) on functional and biocompatible immunomagnetic nanosphere interfaces (IMNs). The IMNs were achieved by functionalizing superparamagnetic iron oxide nanospheres (Fe<sub>3</sub>O<sub>4</sub>) with polymerized ionic liquid (PIL), and then coating with epithelial-cell-adhesion-molecule antibody (anti-EpCAM). The IMNs exhibited outstanding cell capture efficiency (above 95%) and specificity when employed to separate multiple EpCAM-positive tumor cells, due to the abundant carboxyl groups in the structure of PIL, which enhanced the coupling efficiency of MNs with anti-EpCAM by chemical bonding between carboxyls and amines, thereby enabling more target cells adhered onto IMNs. Under the optimized capture conditions, IMNs were shown an excellent cell capture performance in the range of 5-400â€¯cells/mL in three different cases (e.g., PBS, MCF-7 and THP-1 mixed cell suspension, lysed blood). More significantly, our results indicated that with modification of PIL, in addition to the capture efficiency, the cell viability rate of CTCs was also greatly improved (98%) owing to the nontoxic and biocompatible properties of PIL, which realized the proliferation of the rare number CTCs for further molecular characterization. Finally, the IMNs were successfully applied to the isolation and detection of CTCs in cancer patient peripheral blood samples and as low as one CTC in the whole blood was captured and identified by the ICC method.

Circulating tumor cells (CTCs) served as an important biomarker for tumor recurrence and prediction of prognosis. However, selective capture and quantification of CTCs from whole blood was still full of challenge due to the extremely scare number of CTCs. Moreover, how to keep a high cell viability after capture remained to be solved. Here, we described a ratiometric fluorescent probe for the efficient capture and accurate determination of CTCs by conjugating graphitic carbon nitride quantum dots (g-CNQDs) with gold nanoclusters (AuNCs) and further linking with anti-EpCAM antibody to acquire the CTC-specific immune probe. In this probe, AuNCs protected by albumin V bovine played the role as the fluorophore reference and anti-EpCAM-attached g-CNQDs acted as both the response signal and specific recognition element for sensing CTCs. In the presence of CTCs, the quenched fluorescence of the immune probe at 500 nm was recovered due to the detachment of anti-EpCAM from the probe, whereas the intensity at 650 nm was essentially unchanged. This strategy realized the highly sensitive detection of CTCs in whole blood down to one CTC. Furthermore, it was demonstrated that the designed probe allowed capturing living CTCs with minimal cell damage. The subsequent reculture of captured cells for proliferation revealed that after a 7 day proliferation, almost 28 MCF-7 cells were obtained from one target cell. The immune probe was successfully applied into capture and detection of CTCs from clinical cancer patients. Our data suggested the good potential of fluorescent probe for the clinical diagnosis of cancers.

The enumeration of circulating tumor cells has long been regarded as an attractive diagnostic tool, as circulating tumor cells are thought to reflect aggressiveness of the tumor and may assist in therapeutic decisions in patients with solid malignancies. However, implementation of this assay into clinical routine has been cumbersome, as a validated test was not available until recently. Circulating tumor cells are rare events which can be detected specifically only by using a combination of surface and intracellular markers, and only recently a number of technical advances have made their reliable detection possible. Most of these new techniques rely on a combination of an enrichment and a detection step. This review addresses the assays that have been described so far in the literature, including the enrichment and detection steps and the markers used in these assays. We have focused on breast cancer as most clinical studies on CTC detection so far have been done in these patients.

The selective detection of circulating tumor cells (CTCs) is of significant clinical importance for the clinical diagnosis and prognosis of cancer metastasis. However, largely because of the extremely low number of CTCs (as low as 1 in 10(9) hematologic cells) in the blood of patients, effective detection and separation of the rare cells remain a tremendous challenge. Cell rolling is known to play a key role in physiological processes such as the recruitment of leukocytes to sites of inflammation and selectin-mediated CTC metastasis. Furthermore, because CTCs typically express the epithelial-cell adhesion molecule (EpCAM) on the surface whereas normal hematologic cells do not, substrates with immobilized antibody against EpCAM may specifically interact with CTCs. In this article, we created biomimetic surfaces functionalized with P- and E-selectin and anti-EpCAM that induce different responses in HL-60 (used as a model of leukocytes in this study) and MCF-7 (a model of CTCs) cells. HL-60 and MCF-7 cells showed different degrees of interaction with P-/E-selectin and anti-EpCAM at a shear stress of 0.32 dyn/cm(2). HL-60 cells exhibited rolling on P-selectin-immobilized substrates at a velocity of 2.26 +/- 0.28 microm/s whereas MCF-7 cells had no interaction with the surface. Both cell lines, however, had interactions with E-selectin, and the rolling velocity of MCF-7 cells (4.24 +/- 0.31 microm/s) was faster than that of HL-60 cells (2.12 +/- 0.15 microm/s). However, only MCF-7 cells interacted with anti-EpCAM-coated surfaces, forming stationary binding under flow. More importantly, the combination of the rolling (E-selectin) and stationary binding (anti-EpCAM) resulted in substantially enhanced separation capacity and capture efficiency (more than 3-fold enhancement), as compared to a surface functionalized solely with anti-EpCAM that has been commonly used for CTC capture. Our results indicate that cell-specific detection and separation may be achieved through mimicking the biological processes of combined dynamic cell rolling and stationary binding, which will likely lead to a CTC detection device with significantly enhanced specificity and sensitivity without a complex fabrication process.
