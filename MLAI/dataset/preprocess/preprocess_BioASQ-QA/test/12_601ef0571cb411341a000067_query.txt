What is another name for  keratomileusis?

[PMID: 9848072]
LASIK (Laser in situ keratomileusis) is used in refractive surgery especially for correction of higher degrees of myopia. Preservation of Bowman's layer as well as less postoperative pain and the slight to absent subepithelial haze are regarded as advantages compared to photorefractive keratectomy (PRK). However, numerous serious complications have been described in the literature. LASIK treatment was performed elsewhere in two patients to treat myopia or myopic astigmatism between -6 and -9 diopters (D). An astigmatism of -6 D was corrected with the LASIK method in another patient with keratoconus. Progressive corneal ectasia of up to seven diopters occurred in all four eyes within a few months. Corneal ectasia can occur after LASIK even in low degrees of myopia of less than ten diopters. Recently, -12 D has been specified as the upper limit for this technique. It is especially important to rule out an early keratoconus or a forme fruste of keratoconus preoperatively since keratectasia with particularly rapid progression can occur in such cases: we would like to designate this as "malignant keratoconus".

To provide an overview of the currently available retreatment methods after myopic small-incision lenticule extraction (SMILE). Systematic literature review. The PubMed library was searched for articles containing the terms "small-incision lenticule extraction" and "enhancement" or "retreatment". The last search was performed on May 1, 2019. In contrast to laser in-situ keratomileusis (LASIK), which can be retreated by a flap relift, repeat SMILE retreatment is currently not approved and only seldomly performed. As substitutes, surface ablation, cap-to-flap conversion using the CIRCLE program in the VisuMax platform, and thin-flap LASIK have been recently established. While all options offer safety and efficacy comparable to LASIK retreatments, each has its patient-specific advantages and disadvantages. While surface ablation preserves the flap-free approach of the primary procedure, the aspect of pain and a slow visual recovery might render it less attractive as compared with CIRCLE and thin-flap LASIK which offer quick recovery, however at the price of flap creation. Besides, each retreatment method generates specific tissue responses and has a different impact on corneal biomechanics, which is strongly dependent on the previous SMILE parameters, especially the cap thickness. Refractive enhancement after SMILE is currently mostly performed by surface ablation, CIRCLE cap-to-flap conversion or thin-flap LASIK, which all offer safety and efficacy comparable to LASIK retreatments. In this review, a detailed overview over each method, its technical aspects, and specific advantages and disadvantages is given.

Refractive surgery includes all procedures which are primarily targeted at changing the refractive power of the eye. Currently laser-assisted in situ keratomileusis (LASIK) is indicated to correct myopia of up to - 8 D, hyperopia up to + 3 D and astigmatism up to 5 D. Photorefractive keratectomy (PRK) and laser epithelial keratomileusis (LASEK) are primarily recommended for myopia up to - 6 D and for greater refractive errors, phakic intraocular lenses (IOL) are the first choice (myopia greater than - 6 D and hyperopia greater than + 3 D). If presbyopia is present in addition to the high refractive error, refractive lens exchange is another alternative.

Laser epithelial keratomileusis (LASEK) is a new keratorefractive procedure for the correction of myopia and myopic astigmatism, which may combine advantages and eliminate disadvantages of photorefractive keratectomy (e.g. pain, corneal haze) and laser in situ keratomileusis (e.g. flap and interface complications, dry eye, keratectasia). We present the results of 108 consecutively LASEK-treated eyes with a follow-up period of 12 months. LASEK was performed on 108 consecutive eyes with myopia or myopic astigmatism using a keracor 117 excimer laser. The mean preoperative refraction was -4.12+/-1.30 diopters (D) spherical equivalent range: -1.75 to -6.0 D and maximal cylinder was 3.25 D. Results of the 12 months visit are available for 101 eyes (93.5%). No serious complications were observed. After 12 months, SE was within +/-1.0 D of emmetropia in 96% and within +/-0.5 D in 86% of the eyes; 6 eyes had to be retreated. None of the eyes showed haze worse than grade 1 or lost more than one line of best-corrected visual acuity. Uncorrected visual acuity (UCVA) was > or =20/20 in 80% and > or =20/40 in 98%. Laser epithelial keratomileusis (LASEK) seems to be safe and effective in treatment of myopia and myopic astigmatism of up to -6.0 D. Preliminary results compare favourably with those after photorefractive keratectomy and laser in situ keratomileusis. Haze formation after LASEK seems to be low. Coverage of the stromal wound with a vital epithelial flap could positively influence postoperative wound healing reactions.

Laser subepithelial keratomileusis (LASEK) is a relatively new refractive surgical technique that purportedly combines the advantages of laser in-situ keratomileusis (LASIK) and photorefractive keratectomy (PRK). Like LASIK, on the one hand, it employs a "flap" and consequently has the advantages of faster visual recovery, less postoperative pain, reduced stromal haze, and faster epithelial healing than PRK. Like PRK, on the other hand, because the procedure is performed on the anterior cornea, there are virtually no flap- or interface-related complications per se. It may thus be safer for patients who are at an inherently higher risk of developing flap complications, such as those with small palpebral fissures, deep-set eyes, corneal basement membrane dystrophy, and extremely steep or flat corneas. Furthermore, it conserves precious stroma in eyes with thin corneas or high myopia, which otherwise may not qualify for LASIK. It may also be more apropos for patients whose jobs or recreational activities put them at a higher risk of corneal trauma. In a very timely fashion, for reasons discussed below, LASEK may also prove to be superior to LASIK in customized ablations.

Report the outcomes of laser in situ keratomileusis (LASIK) for high myopia correction after long-term follow-up. Retrospective, consecutive, clinical study including 70 eyes that underwent LASIK using a 500 Hertz (Hz) repetition rate excimer laser and femtosecond technology for flap creation. Visual, refractive, corneal aberrations, and correlation among the variables were evaluated during 3 years. In addition, 34 eyes were followed during 5 years. Significant improvement of 17 logMAR lines was observed in uncorrected vision at 5 years (p < 0.01). This was consistent with spherical equivalent reduction that came from mean preoperative -7.79 diopters (D) to 5 years postoperative -0.24 D (p < 0.01). Significant induction of primary spherical aberration and coma aberration was also found (p < 0.01) at 3 months with levels of 0.61 µm and 0.47 µm, respectively, with no further changes at 5 years (p > 0.05). Pearson correlation showed that the amount of high-order aberrations at 3 months postoperativeley was significantly correlated with the changes in the keratometry throughout the 5 years (delta K) (R2 0.242 p = 0.05). Finally, preoperative corneal asphericity showed an inverse correlation with the delta K (R2 -308 p = 0.01). Results from this study suggests that LASIK for high myopia correction using 500 Hz repetition rate excimer laser provides stable visual, refractive and aberrometric results after 5 years of follow-up. A more prolate cornea and the amount of higher-order aberrations induced after LASIK are factors that negatively impact in the long-term stability of the procedure.

Laser in situ keratomileusis (LASIK) and small-incision lenticule extraction (SMILE) are popular refractive surgeries. The objective refractive outcomes of LASIK and SMILE have been studied extensively; both procedures have comparable safety, efficacy, and predictability. However, owing to various psychosocial factors, refractive patients may report dissatisfaction despite good postoperative vision. Hence the importance of studies on subjective patient-reported outcomes. This review discusses the role of psychometric-technique-based validated questionnaires when evaluating subjective outcomes. It also summarizes the literature on patient-reported outcomes for LASIK and SMILE. A literature search was performed on PubMed database to identify studies that have assessed patient-reported outcomes for LASIK and SMILE. Several studies have looked into patient-reported outcome measures for LASIK, but the number of equivalent studies for SMILE is limited. Questionnaires (validated and non-validated) are used to evaluate patient-reported outcomes. Validated questionnaires are designed based on psychometric techniques, such as Classic Test Theory, Item Response Theory, and Rasch analysis. The Quality of Life Impact of Refractive Correction (QIRC) questionnaire, a validated questionnaire administered to both LASIK and SMILE patients, suggests that both groups have comparable vision-related quality of life in the first few months postoperatively; but SMILE might confer a slight advantage in the later postoperative period (postoperative month 6). Future LASIK-SMILE comparative studies utilizing standardized validated questionnaires for patient-reported outcome measures with longer follow-up durations would be a welcome contribution to this important aspect of refractive surgery.

Ectasia after laser in situ keratomileusis (LASIK) is a rare but serious complication. Prevention includes proper patient selection with detection of those at particular risk. Causes of ectasia include predisposition, excessive ablation with less than 250 microm of residual stromal bed, thicker than normal flap, irregular corneal thickness, and different ablation rates. We evaluated corneal curvature patterns and their relationship to corneal topography and pachymetry maps. Corneal topography (axial, tangential, and altimetric) and pachymetry map characteristics of normally astigmatic corneas, keratoconus, false-positive and false-negative cases, as well as contact lens-induced warpage are discussed. Preoperative pachymetry maps for LASIK surgery allow accurate case selection through detection of borderline cases, and provide important documentation of preoperative status, as well as useful information for improving surgical strategy. Another important parameter is the asphericity index.

Glaucoma may not be an absolute contraindication to Laser-Assisted in situ Keratomileusis (LASIK), but so far it is a relative one. People who are glaucoma suspects or who have glaucoma are just as likely as any other to seek laser refractive surgery. LASIK is a popular ocular procedure, relatively pain free and it is carried out with an extremely precise computer-controlled excimer laser emission. On the other hand, glaucoma is a group of diseases manifested by optic nerve damage with visual field changes. Patients that undergo a transient but significant rise in intraocular pressure during LASIK procedure have risk of further optic nerve damage. Furthermore, steroids which are typically used after refractive surgery can increase intraocular pressure (IOP) especially in steroid responders, who are more prevalent among glaucoma patient. Glaucoma patients interested in LASIK surgery may visit a glaucoma specialist or another LASIK surgeon who has had experience with performing LASIK in glaucoma patients. PRK (photorefractive keratectomy), LASEK (laser epithelial keratomileusis) are good alternatives for glaucoma patients. Refractive surgeons might want to consider giving patients a photo of their optic nerve, or a drawing, or an objective record of their preoperative examination.

Photorefractive keratectomy, laser epithelial keratomileusis (LASEK) and Epi-LASIK are all variants of a similar type refractive surgery involving laser on the surface of the cornea and differ mainly in management of the epithelium. Although laser in situ keratomileusis (LASIK) is currently the most popular form of refractive surgery, LASEK is the procedure of choice in some patients. We highlight potential complications of LASEK and how these may be managed. Following laser refractive surgery, corneal thickness is reduced, which has implications for intraocular pressure measurement and glaucoma screening and management. This is particularly important following surface laser procedures where no evidence of previous surgery may be visible. In the event that cataract surgery is required at a later date, correct calculation of the appropriate intraocular lens power can be difficult and it thus important that patients are given their preoperative keratometry readings and refraction. Compared with LASIK patients, those who undergo LASEK are considered to be at lower risk of corneal ectasia. Improved understanding of wound healing post LASEK and better postoperative pain management are ongoing challenges.

Keratomileusis, brainchild of Jose I. Barraquer Moner, was conceived and developed as the first stromal sculpting method to correct refractive error in 1948. The word "keratomileusis" literally means "sculpting" of the "cornea." Barraquer's first procedures involved freezing a disc of anterior corneal tissue before removing stromal tissue with a lathe. Over the years, the procedure continued to develop, first through the Barraquer-Krumeich-Swinger non-freeze technique where tissue was removed from the underside of the disc by a second pass of the microkeratome. In-situ keratomileusis was later developed by passing the microkeratome a second time directly on the stromal bed. The procedure became known as automated lamellar keratoplasty with the invention of an automated microkeratome and was further refined by replacing the disc without sutures and later by stopping the microkeratome before the end of the pass to create a hinged flap, as first demonstrated in 1989. The history of the excimer laser dates back to 1900 and the quantum theory, eventually leading to the discovery that 193-nm ultraviolet excimer laser pulses could photoablate tissue without thermal damage. Ultrastructural and wound healing studies confirmed that large area ablation could be performed in the central cornea. This was described as photorefractive keratectomy in 1986 and the first sighted eyes were treated in 1988. An excimer laser was first used to sculpt from the stromal bed under a hinged flap created manually using a trephine and scalpel in 1988. The incorporation of a microkeratome in 1990 finally led to laser in situ keratomileusis-LASIK-as we know it today.

A 33-year-old man who underwent uneventful laser in situ keratomileusis (LASIK) developed pressure-induced stromal edema resulting in an interface haze in both eyes and a pocket of fluid under the flap of the right eye 10 days after surgery, while receiving topical fluorometholone. Intraocular pressure by applanation tonometry was 16 mm Hg in his right eye (erroneous result due to the fluid in the interface) and 34 mm Hg in his left eye. After discontinuation of steroids and addition of ocular hypotensive medication, interface fluid collection disappeared in his right eye. Visual acuity improved and haze diminished in both eyes. This case illustrates that in the same patient a post-LASIK edema induced syndrome may be present with or without fluid in the interface, suggesting that both clinical pictures could be manifestations of a broad spectrum of the same condition. We suggest a new name for this non-inflammatory disorder: post-LASIK edema-induced keratopathy (PLEK).
