What does PCAT6 stand for?

[PMID: 34620745]
Breast cancer is an aggressive malignancy with high morbidity in females worldwide. Extensive studies reveal that long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) are abnormally expressed and act as key regulators in various cancers, including breast cancer. In this work, we investigated the role and regulatory mechanism of lncRNA prostate cancer-associated transcript 6 (PCAT6) in breast cancer progression. Our findings revealed that PCAT6 was overexpressed in breast cancer tissues and cell lines. Furthermore, elevation of PCAT6 reflected an adverse prognosis of patients. Functional experiments indicated that PCAT6 knockdown hampered cell proliferation, facilitated apoptosis and cell cycle arrest in vitro, and inhibited tumor growth in vivo. We also found that the transcription factor SP1 could bind to the PCAT6 promoter and promoted its expression. Subsequently, it was verified that PCAT6 was a molecular sponge for microRNA-326 (miR-326), and the leucine-rich repeat containing the eight family member E (LRRC8E) was a direct target of miR-326. Rescue assays revealed that LRRC8E overexpression attenuated the suppressive effect of PCAT6 knockdown on cellular progression of breast cancer. In summary, this study demonstrated that SP1-activated PCAT6 promoted the malignant behaviors of breast cancer cells by regulating the miR-326/LRRC8E axis.
