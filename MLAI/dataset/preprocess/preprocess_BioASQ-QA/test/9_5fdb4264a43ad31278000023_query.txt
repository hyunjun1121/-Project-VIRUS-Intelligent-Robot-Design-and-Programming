What is a likely origin of intronless genes?

[PMID: 21620332]
This study assessed the relationship between the occurrence and function of intronless or single exon genes (SEG) in the genome of five teleost species and their phylogenetic distance. The results revealed that Takifugu rubripes, Tetraodon nigroviridis, Oryzias latipes, Gasterosteus aculeatus and Danio rerio genomes are respectively comprised of 2.83%, 3.42%, 4.49%, 4.35% and 4.02% SEGs. These SEGs encode for a variety of family proteins including claudins, olfactory receptors and histones that are essential for various biological functions. Subsequently, we predicted and annotated SEGs in three European sea bass, Dicentrarchus labrax chromosomes that we have sequenced, and compared results with those of stickleback (G. aculeatus) homologous chromosomes. While the annotation features of three D. labrax chromosomes revealed 78 (5.30%) intronless genes, comparisons with G. aculeatus showed that SEG composition and their order varied significantly among corresponding chromosomes, even for those with nearly complete synteny. More than half of SEGs identified in most of the species have at least one ortholog multiple exon gene in the same genome, which provides insight to their possible origin by retrotransposition. In spite of the fact that they belong to the same lineage, the fraction of predicted SEGs varied significantly between the genomes analyzed, and only a low fraction of proteins (4.1%) is conserved between all five species. Furthermore, the inter-specific distribution of SEGs as well as the functional categories shared by species did not reflect their phylogenetic relationships. These results indicate that new SEGs are continuously and independently generated after species divergence over evolutionary time as evidenced by the phylogenetic results of single exon claudins genes. Although the origin of SEGs cannot be inferred directly from the phylogeny, our results provide strong support for the idea that retrotransposition followed by tandem duplications is the most probable event that can explain the expansion of SEGs in eukaryotic organisms.

Intronless genes can arise by germline retrotransposition of a cDNA originating as mRNA from an intron-containing source gene. Previously, we described several members of a family of intronless mammalian genes encoding a novel class of zinc-finger proteins, including one that shows imprinted expression and one that escapes X-inactivation. We report here the identification and characterization of the Makorin ring finger protein 1 gene (MKRN1), a highly transcribed, intron-containing source for this family of genes. Phylogenetic analyses clearly indicate that the MKRN1 gene is the ancestral founder of this gene family. We have identified MKRN1 orthologs from human, mouse, wallaby, chicken, fruitfly, and nematode, underscoring the age and conservation of this gene. The MKRN gene family encodes putative ribonucleoproteins with a distinctive array of zinc-finger motifs, including two to four C(3)H zinc-fingers, an unusual Cys/His arrangement that may represent a novel zinc-finger structure, and a highly conserved RING zinc-finger. To date, we have identified nine MKRN family loci distributed throughout the human genome. The human and mouse MKRN1 loci map to a conserved syntenic group near the T-cell receptor beta cluster (TCRB) in chromosome 7q34-q35 and chromosome 6A, respectively. MKRN1 is widely transcribed in mammals, with high levels in murine embryonic nervous system and adult testis. The ancient origin of MKRN1, high degree of conservation, and expression pattern suggest important developmental and functional roles for this gene and its expressed family members.

Intronless genes, as a characteristic feature of prokaryotes, are an important resource for the study of the evolution of gene architecture in eukaryotes. In the study, 14,623 (36.87%) intronless genes in maize were identified and the percentage is greater than that of other monocots and algae. The number of maize intronless genes on each chromosome has a significant linear correlation with the number of total genes on the chromosome and the length of the chromosomes. Intronless genes in maize play important roles in translation and energy metabolism. Evolutionary analysis revealed that 2601 intronless genes conserved among the three domains of life and 2323 intronless genes that had no homology with genes of other species. These two sets of intronless genes were distinct in genetic features, physical locations and function. These results provided a useful source to understand the evolutionary patterns of related genes and genomes and some intronless genes are good candidates for subsequent functional analyses specifically.

In Teleost fish examined to date the ocular rod opsin gene, rho, is intronless, unlike the rod opsin genes of other vertebrate classes which possess a five exon/four intron structure. We have examined in silico the structure of rho (which is expressed uniquely in the retina) and the closely related extraretinal rod-like opsin (exo-rhodopsin) gene, errlo (which is expressed uniquely in the pineal), in the puffer-fish, Fugu rubripes (Takifugu rubripes). Whilst the ocular rho is intronless in common with other Teleosts, the pineal errlo has the five exon/four intron structure common to the rod opsin gene of other vertebraes. A comparison of the sequence surrounding the errlo and rho loci indicates that the errlo locus is syntenic with RHO, the human rod opsin gene, rather than rho. We suggest that the intronless rho may have arisen through an ancient retrotransposition of a mature mRNA originating from errlo. This duplication event has occurred early in the evolution of the Actinopterygii (ray-finned fish) since the rho of the primitive Actinopterygians such as sturgeon, bowfin, and gar is also intronless. Since it appears that the intron containing errlo is the ancestral opsin gene that gave rise to the intronless rho in the Teleostei, errlo is therefore the true orthologue of the rod opsin gene in other vertebrate classes. We suggest that loss of expression of errlo in the retina could be related to the metabolic and physiological advantages, such as a reduction in splicing events during RNA processing, that may be conferred through possession of an additional, intronless rod opsin gene in the form of rho.

Nucleosomes, the basic units of chromatin, are involved in transcription regulation and DNA replication. Intronless genes, which constitute 3 percent of the human genome, differ from intron-containing genes in evolution and function. Our analysis reveals that nucleosome positioning shows a distinct pattern in intronless and intron-containing genes. The nucleosome occupancy upstream of transcription start sites of intronless genes is lower than that of intron-containing genes. In contrast, high occupancy and well positioned nucleosomes are observed along the gene body of intronless genes, which is perfectly consistent with the barrier nucleosome model. Intronless genes have a significantly lower expression level than intron-containing genes and most of them are not expressed in CD4+ T cell lines and GM12878 cell lines, which results from their tissue specificity. However, the highly expressed genes are at the same expression level between the two types of genes. The highly expressed intronless genes require a higher density of RNA Pol II in an elongating state to compensate for the lack of introns. Additionally, 5' and 3' nucleosome depleted regions of highly expressed intronless genes are deeper than those of highly expressed intron-containing genes.

Intronless genes (IGs) constitute approximately 3% of the human genome. Human IGs are essentially different in evolution and functionality from the IGs of unicellular eukaryotes, which represent the majority in their genomes. Functional analysis of IGs has revealed a massive over-representation of signal transduction genes and genes encoding regulatory proteins important for growth, proliferation, and development. IGs also often display tissue-specific expression, usually in the nervous system and testis. These characteristics translate into IG-associated diseases, mainly neuropathies, developmental disorders, and cancer. IGs represent recent additions to the genome, created mostly by retroposition of processed mRNAs with retained functionality. Processing, nuclear export, and translation of these mRNAs should be hampered dramatically by the lack of splice factors, which normally tightly cover mature transcripts and govern their fate. However, natural IGs manage to maintain satisfactory expression levels. Different mechanisms by which IGs solve the problem of mRNA processing and nuclear export are discussed here, along with their possible impact on reporter studies.

Using computational approaches we have identified 2017 expressed intronless genes in the mouse genome. Evolutionary analysis reveals that 56 intronless genes are conserved among the three domains of life--bacteria, archea and eukaryotes. These highly conserved intronless genes were found to be involved in essential housekeeping functions. About 80% of expressed mouse intronless genes have orthologs in eukaryotic genomes only, and thus are specific to eukaryotic organisms. 608 of these genes have intronless human orthologs and 302 of these orthologs have a match in OMIM database. Investigation into these mouse genes will be important in generating mouse models for understanding human diseases.

The human transcriptome is constituted of a great majority of intron-containing and a minority of intron-lacking mRNAs; given the different processing these transcripts undergo, they are expected to carry, intermingled with coding properties, very different editing information. Here we applied a computational approach to compare intronless and intron-containing coding sequences. Hexamer composition comparison allowed the definition of over- and under-represented motifs in intronless genes; surprisingly, experimental testing revealed that intron-lacking coding sequences are enriched rather than depleted in elements with splicing enhancement ability. Similarly, we show evidence that intronless transcripts display a significantly higher frequency of both shuttling and non-shuttling SR protein binding sites compared to intron-containing sequences. These observations suggest that SR proteins (and possibly other splicing factors) play a role in cellular processes distinct from splicing.

Genes without introns are a characteristic feature of prokaryotes, but there are still a number of intronless genes in eukaryotes. To study these eukaryotic genes that have prokaryotic architecture could help to understand the evolutionary patterns of related genes and genomes. Our analyses revealed a number of intronless genes that reside in 6 deuterostomes (sea urchin, sea squirt, zebrafish, chicken, platypus, and human). We also determined the conservation for each intronless gene in archaea, bacteria, fungi, plants, metazoans, and other eukaryotes. Proportions of intronless genes that are inherited from the common ancestor of archaea, bacteria, and eukaryotes in these species were consistent with their phylogenetic positions, with more proportions of ancient intronless genes residing in more primitive species. In these species, intronless genes belong to different cellular roles and gene ontology (GO) categories, and some of these functions are very basic. Part of intronless genes is derived from other intronless genes or multiexon genes in each species. In conclusion, we showed that a varying number and proportion of intronless genes reside in these 6 deuterostomes, and some of them function importantly. These genes are good candidates for subsequent functional and evolutionary analyses specifically.
