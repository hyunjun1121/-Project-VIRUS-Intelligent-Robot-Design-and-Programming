Which translocation is the hallmark of Ewing sarcoma?

[PMID: 22266186]
The chromosomal translocation t(11;22)(q24;q12) yields the EWS-Fli1 fusion gene, which contributes to the development of Ewing Family Tumors (EFTs). Previous studies have shown the ability of EWS-Fli1 chimeric protein to silence p53 activity. Here we demonstrate that the introduction of EWS-Fli1 significantly inhibited p300-mediated acetylation of p53 at Lys-382 and depletion of EWS-Fli1 protein by small interfering RNAs (siRNA) in EFTs cells facilitated it in response to DNA damage. Furthermore, the deacetylation of p53 by EWS-Fli1 suppressed its transcriptional activity and enhanced mdm2-mediated p53 degradation. On the other hand, immunoprecipitation study shows that N-terminal region of EWS-Fli1 associated with histone deacetylase 1 (HDAC1) to forms a complex with p53. Knockdown of HDAC1, but not HDAC2 or HDAC3 protein restored the expression of p53 Lys-382 in EFTs cells. Overexpression of HDAC1 also significantly inhibited p53 transcriptional activity. Pharmacologic inhibitor of HDAC, trichostatin A (TSA) promoted p53-p300 interaction and recruitment of p53 Lys-382 to promoter regions of its target genes p21 and Puma, consequently inducing apoptosis and stabilizing the acetylation of p53 at Lys-382 together with the upregulation of p21 and Puma, which were impaired in EFTs cells after the knockdown of p53 expression. Our data indicate EWS-Fli1 might deacetylate p53 to inhibit its transcriptional function and protein stability via the recruitment of HDAC1. These results might elucidate a novel molecular mechanism about the abrogation of p53 pathway by EWS-Fli1 in EFTs pathogenesis.

To describe a patient with metastasis of Ewing sarcoma to the choroid and the molecular genetics of the tumor. A 26-year-old woman with metastatic Ewing sarcoma developed large choroidal masses in the left eye and died 2 months later. Autopsy of the eyes was performed. Dual-color fluorescent in situ hybridization was used to detect genetic alteration in the ocular tumor with EWS and FLI-1 probes. Histopathology confirmed choroidal metastatic Ewing sarcoma. Molecular analysis showed chromosomal translocation t(11;22)(q24;q12) or EWS/FLI-1 rearrangement in the malignant cells of the eye. Ewing sarcoma can rarely metastasize to the uvea. Molecular detection of the t(11;22)(q24;q12) translocation in Ewing sarcoma is valuable in the differential diagnosis of small round cell tumors.

Translocations involving ETS-transcription factors, most commonly leading to the EWSR1-FLI1 fusion protein, are the hallmark of Ewing sarcoma. Despite knowledge of this driving molecular event, an effective therapeutic strategy is lacking. To test potential treatment regimes, we established a novel Ewing sarcoma zebrafish engraftment model allowing time-effective, dynamic quantification of Ewing sarcoma progression and tumour burden in vivo, applicable for screening of single and combined compounds. In Ewing sarcoma the tumour-suppressor gene TP53 is commonly found to be wild-type, thus providing an attractive target for treatment. Here, we study TP53 wild-type (EW7, CADO-ES1 and TC32) and TP53-deleted (SK-N-MC) Ewing sarcoma cell lines to investigate the potentiating effect of p53 reactivation by Nutlin-3 on treatment with YK-4-279 to block transcriptional activity of EWSR1-FLI1 protein. Blocking EWSR1-FLI1 transcriptional activity reduced Ewing sarcoma tumour cell burden irrespective of TP53 status. We show that simultaneous YK-4-279 treatment with Nutlin-3 to stabilize p53 resulted in an additive inhibition of TP53 wild-type Ewing sarcoma cell burden, whilst not affecting TP53-deleted Ewing sarcoma cells. Improved inhibition of proliferation and migration by combinatorial treatment was confirmed in vivo by zebrafish engraftments. Mechanistically, both compounds together additively induced apoptosis of tumour cells in vivo by engaging distinct pathways. We propose reactivation of the p53 pathway in combination with complementary targeted therapy by EWSR1-FLI1 transcriptional activity disruption as a valuable strategy against p53 wild-type Ewing sarcoma.

Tumours defined as Ewing sarcoma (ES) constitute a group of highly malignant neoplasms that most often affect children and young adults in the first 2 decades of life. The EWS/Fli-1 fusion gene, a product of the translocation t(11;22) (q24; 12), is detected in 95% of ES patients. Recently, it was validated that cells emit a heterogeneous mixture of vesicular, organelle-like structures (microvesicles, MVs) into their surroundings including blood and body fluids, and that these MVs contain a selected set of tumor-related proteins and high levels of mRNAs and miRNAs. In this present study, we detected the Ewing sarcoma-specific EWS/Fli-1 mRNA in MVs from the culture medium of ES cell lines carrying t(11;22) (q24; 12). Also, we detected this fusion gene in approximately 40% of the blood samples from mice inoculated with xenografts of TC135 or A673 cells. These findings indicate the EWS/Fli-1 mRNA in MVs might be a new non-invasive diagnostic marker for specific cases of Ewing sarcoma.

The hallmark of Ewing's sarcoma (EWS) is a translocation--t(11;22)(q24;q12)--that most frequently results in the EWS/FLI1 aberrant chimeric gene. Because EWS afflicts young patients, it stands out among the diverse sarcoma subtypes. The frontline, standard-of-care cytotoxic chemotherapy regimens produce minimal benefit in patients with metastases at presentation or those with relapsed disease. While the outcomes of chemorefractory EWS patients are generally poor, recent developments have led to the promising use of targeted therapy. Specifically, inhibition of insulin-like growth factor 1 receptor (IGF1R) signaling and the mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) pathways has emerged as a targeted therapy in EWS, with select patients experiencing dramatic therapeutic responses. However, targeted therapies in general, and these responders in particular, are faced with the ultimate conundrum of eventual resistance. To optimize response, combining IGF1R and mTOR inhibitor-based regimens with chemotherapy in the upfront setting in newly diagnosed high-risk EWS may clarify the true benefit of IGF1R inhibitors in these patients. Another option is to explore novel targeted multikinase inhibitors and poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) inhibitors, which have experienced a surge in supporting preclinical data. Drugs inhibiting the downstream targets of EWS/FLI1 are also in preclinical development. However, ultimately, the underlying biomarker correlates of resistance and response must be delineated along with ways to overcome them. Novel agents, together with integration of advances in multimodal approaches (including surgery and radiation), as well as offering targeted therapies early in the disease course represent new strategies for confronting the challenges of EWS.

Ewing's sarcoma is a malignancy characterized by a specific 11:22 chromosomal translocation which generates a novel EWS-FLI1 fusion protein functioning as an aberrant transcription factor. In the present study, we have further characterized the junction region of the EWS-FLI1 fusion protein. In-silico model of EWS-FLI1 fusion protein was analysed for ligand binding sites, and a putative region (amino acid (aa) 251-343 of the type 1 fusion protein) in the vicinity of the fusion junction was cloned and expressed using bacterial expression. The recombinant protein was characterized by Circular Dichroism (CD). We then expressed aa 251-280 ectopically in Ewing's sarcoma cell-line and its effect on cell proliferation, tumorigenicity and expression of EWS-FLI1 target genes were analysed. Our modelling analysis indicated that Junction region (aa 251-343) encompasses potential ligand biding sites in the EWS-FLI1 protein and when expressed in bacteria was present as soluble form. Ectopically expressing this region in Ewing's sarcoma cells inhibited tumorigenicity, and EWS-FLI1 target genes indicating a dominant negative biological effect. Junction region can be exploited further as target for drug development in future to specifically target EWS-FLI1 in Ewing's Sarcoma.

Ewing's sarcoma (ES) is a highly malignant tumor composed of uniform small round cells. Recently, a single biologic entity, Ewing's sarcoma family of tumors (ESFT) has been accepted. The entity includes ES, extraskeletal Ewing's sarcoma (EES) and primitive neuroectodermal tumor (PNET). ESFT cells have immunoreactivity for CD99, an antigen determined by the MIC2 gene. Most ESFT has the (11;22) (q24;q12) translocation. The translocation results in the fusion of the EWS gene with the transcription factor gene FLI1 which has been considered a hallmark of ESFT. We present an extremely unusual case with ESFT in a spinal nerve root mimicking a neurogenic dumbbell tumor. A male aged 20 years noticed pain in his right buttock. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) revealed a mass in the right L5/S intervertebral foramen and the lesions in the sacrum. Surgery was performed with a presumptive diagnosis of a nerve sheath tumor. At surgery, the tumor was located in the right L5 nerve root sleeve. The sacral lesions were observed closely. At one month after surgery, radiologically multiple lesions were detected in the pelvic bones. Microscopically the lesions from the root and ilium were composed of small round cells immunoreactive for CD99. Reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction detected transcripts resulting from the fusion of the EWS gene with FLI1 genes in the iliac lesion. Immunoreactivity for CD99 and detection of the EWS-FLI1 hybrid transcripts are important for the correct diagnosis of ESFT arising in an unusual location.

Approximately one-third of sarcomas contain specific translocations. Ewing sarcoma is the prototypical member of this group of sarcomas; it was the first to be recognized pathologically as a singular entity and to have its signature translocation defined cytogenetically, which led to the identification of its key driver alteration, the EWS-FLI1 gene fusion that encodes this aberrant, chimeric transcription factor. We review recent progress in selected areas of Ewing sarcoma research, including the application of genome-wide chromatin immunoprecipitation analyses, to provide a comprehensive view of the EWS-FLI1 target gene repertoire, the identification of EWS-FLI1 target genes that may also point to therapeutically targetable pathways, and data from model systems as they relate to the elusive cell of origin of Ewing sarcoma and its possible similarities to mesenchymal stem cells.

The genetic hallmark of the Ewing sarcoma family of tumours (ESFT) is the presence of the t(11;22)(q24;q12) translocation, present in up to 85% of cases of ESFT, which creates the EWS/FLI1 fusion gene and results in the expression of a chimeric protein regulating many other genes. The inhibition of this protein by antisense strategies has shown its predominant role in the transformed phenotype of Ewing cells. In addition, the junction point at the mRNA level offers a target for short therapeutic nucleic acids that is present only in the cancer cells and not in the normal tissues of a patient. Several teams have, therefore, investigated the activity of antisense oligonucleotides and siRNAs targeted against the junction point in mRNA; thus, inhibiting EWS/FLI1 synthesis. Generally speaking, the molecules induce a cell growth inhibition in culture. Apoptosis has also been reported. One laboratory has reported the in vivo tumour inhibitory effect of phosphorothioate antisense oligonucleotide directed against the EWS part of EWS/FlI1 when injected intratumourally. Independently, a tumour inhibitory effect of oligonucleotides targeting the junction point has been demonstrated provided they are delivered by polymeric nanoparticles through the intratumoural route. Alongside this target, other genes participating to the maintenance of the transformed phenotype of Ewing cells have been downregulated by antisense strategies.

EWS-Fli1, a fusion gene resulting from a chromosomal translocation t(11;22, q24;q12) and found in Ewing sarcoma and primitive neuroectodermal tumors, encodes a transcriptional activator and promotes cellular transformation. However, the precise biological functions of its products remain unknown. To investigate the role of EWS-Fli1 in cell growth signaling, we transfected Ewing sarcoma TC-135 cells with short interfering RNAs for EWS-Fli1. EWS-Fli1 knockdown reduced cell growth and platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF)-BB-induced activation of the growth signaling enzymes. Interestingly, phospholipase D2 (but not the PDGF-BB receptor) showed marked down-regulation in the EWS-Fli1-knocked down TC-135 cells compared with the control cells. In Ewing sarcoma TC-135 cells, the PDGF-BB-induced phosphorylation of growth signaling involving extracellular signal-regulated kinase, Akt, p70S6K, and the expression of cyclin D3 were markedly inhibited by transfection with short interfering RNA phospholipase (PL)-D2. The PDGF-BB-induced activation of growth signaling was also suppressed by 1-butanol, which prevents the production of phosphatidic acid by phospholipase D (but not by t-butyl alcohol), thereby implicating PLD2 in PDGF-BB-mediated signaling in TC-135 cells. These results suggest that EWS-Fli1 may play a role in the regulation of tumor proliferation-signaling enzymes via PLD2 expression in Ewing sarcoma cells.

Chromosomal translocations generating oncogenic transcription factors are the hallmark of a variety of tumors, including many sarcomas. Ewing sarcoma family of tumors (ESFTs) are characterized by the t(11;22)(q24;q12) translocation that generates the Ewing sarcoma breakpoint region 1 and Friend leukemia virus integration 1 (EWS-FLI1) fusion transcription factor responsible for the highly malignant phenotype of this tumor. Although continued expression of EWS-FLI1 is believed to be critical for ESFT cell survival, a clinically effective small-molecule inhibitor remains elusive likely because EWS-FLI1 is a transcription factor and therefore widely felt to be "undruggable." We developed a high-throughput screen to evaluate more than 50 000 compounds for inhibition of EWS-FLI1 activity in TC32 ESFT cells. We used a TC32 cell-based luciferase reporter screen using the EWS-FLI1 downstream target NR0B1 promoter and a gene signature secondary screen to sort and prioritize the compounds. We characterized the lead compound, mithramycin, based on its ability to inhibit EWS-FLI1 activity in vitro using microarray expression profiling, quantitative reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction, and immunoblot analysis, and in vivo using immunohistochemistry. We studied the impact of this inhibition on cell viability in vitro and on tumor growth in ESFT xenograft models in vivo (n = 15-20 mice per group). All statistical tests were two-sided. Mithramycin inhibited expression of EWS-FLI1 downstream targets at the mRNA and protein levels and decreased the growth of ESFT cells at half maximal inhibitory concentrations between 10 (95% confidence interval [CI] = 8 to 13 nM) and 15 nM (95% CI = 13 to 19 nM). Mithramycin suppressed the growth of two different ESFT xenograft tumors and prolonged the survival of ESFT xenograft-bearing mice by causing a decrease in mean tumor volume. For example, in the TC32 xenograft model, on day 15 of treatment, the mean tumor volume for the mithramycin-treated mice was approximately 3% of the tumor volume observed in the control mice (mithramycin vs control: 69 vs 2388 mm(3), difference = 2319 mm(3), 95% CI = 1766 to 2872 mm(3), P < .001). Mithramycin inhibits EWS-FLI1 activity and demonstrates ESFT antitumor activity both in vitro and in vivo.

The Ewing sarcoma family of tumors (ESFT) includes classic Ewing sarcoma of the bone, extraosseous or soft tissue Ewing sarcoma, Askin tumors of the chest wall, and peripheral primitive neuroectodermal tumors of the bone and soft tissues. They share a common neural histogenesis, tumor genetics and biology. The genetic hallmark of the ESFT is the presence of t(11;22)(q24;q12), which creates the EWS/FLI1 fusion gene and results in the expression of a chimeric protein. Although Ewing tumors can occur at any age, the great majority are found in individuals less than 20 years of age. We herein report a case of gastric Ewing sarcoma in a 68-year-old male. This patient illustrates the second reported occurrence of primary Ewing sarcoma in the stomach and the first reported with the t(11;22)(q24;q12) gene translocation.

Primitive neuroectodermal tumors are in the Ewing's sarcoma family of tumors and are composed of small round cells. Because of their rare occurrence, optimal therapy is challenging, particularly if they occur in the head and neck. Diagnosis is based on history, immunostaining with at least 2 neural markers, ultrastructural examination, and evidence of an abnormal t(11;22)(q24;q12) translocation as the hallmark for the Ewing's sarcoma family. The prognosis in general is poor because of overt metastasis at the time of diagnosis. Of 27 reported patients with primitive neuroectodermal tumors of the head and neck, 23 were less than 20 years of age. Most patients presented with a tumor in the nasal cavity, paranasal sinuses, or neck. Symptoms developed rapidly (3.6 months, on average), and a lethal outcome occurred in 9 patients. This highly malignant tumor requires an aggressive combination of radical resection, chemotherapy, and radiotherapy. A close follow-up with regular radiographic examination for at least 5 years is mandatory.

Chromosome studies were performed on 5 Ewing sarcoma cell lines. An identical reciprocal translocation t(11; 22) (q24; q12) was found in 4 cell lines established from 3 different tumors. These results, associated with those obtained at the same time and independently from fresh tumor cells, suggest that the translocation t(11; 22)(q24; q12) may be a chromosomal marker characteristic of Ewing sarcoma cells. This translocation involves the chromosome 22 on which the H-c-sis oncogene has been located; it could be used as a new tool for exploring the role of genetic transposition in the malignant cell transformation.

Chromosomal translocation that results in fusion of the genes encoding RNA-binding protein EWS and transcription factor FLI1 (EWS-FLI1) is pathognomonic for Ewing sarcoma. EWS-FLI1 alters gene expression through mechanisms that are not completely understood. We performed RNA sequencing (RNAseq) analysis on primary pediatric human mesenchymal progenitor cells (pMPCs) expressing EWS-FLI1 in order to identify gene targets of this oncoprotein. We determined that long noncoding RNA-277 (Ewing sarcoma-associated transcript 1 [EWSAT1]) is upregulated by EWS-FLI1 in pMPCs. Inhibition of EWSAT1 expression diminished the ability of Ewing sarcoma cell lines to proliferate and form colonies in soft agar, whereas EWSAT1 inhibition had no effect on other cell types tested. Expression of EWS-FLI1 and EWSAT1 repressed gene expression, and a substantial fraction of targets that were repressed by EWS-FLI1 were also repressed by EWSAT1. Analysis of RNAseq data from primary human Ewing sarcoma further supported a role for EWSAT1 in mediating gene repression. We identified heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein (HNRNPK) as an RNA-binding protein that interacts with EWSAT1 and found a marked overlap in HNRNPK-repressed genes and those repressed by EWS-FLI1 and EWSAT1, suggesting that HNRNPK participates in EWSAT1-mediated gene repression. Together, our data reveal that EWSAT1 is a downstream target of EWS-FLI1 that facilitates the development of Ewing sarcoma via the repression of target genes.

Ewing sarcoma is extremely rare in people from East and Southeast Asia. The records of 12 patients diagnosed with primary Ewing sarcoma and treated at our institution from 1997 to 2009 were retrospectively reviewed. There were seven male and five female patients and their mean age at diagnosis was 22 years (range, 12-48 years). Two patients (16.7%) had distant metastasis at diagnosis. The primary tumor sites were the trunk in seven patients (58.3%) and the extremities in five patients (41.7%). Eleven patients received neoadjuvant chemotherapy followed by wide excision surgery, and then adjuvant chemotherapy. One patient received only chemotherapy without surgical intervention due to poor cardiac and pulmonary function. At a mean follow-up of 33 months, the 2-year overall survival rate (OS) was 45.5%. Distant metastasis was the only statistically significant prognostic factor of OS in our study. The 2-year OS rates of patients with lung metastasis and without lung metastasis were 0% and 42.9%, respectively (p = 0.021). The t(11;22)(q24:q12) translocation was present in all patients in our series. We confirmed that distant metastases is highly predictive of a poor outcome, and that the t(11;22)(q24:q12) translocation was present in all patients in our series.

The presence of t(11;22)(q24;q12) is often considered diagnostic of Ewing sarcoma and peripheral primitive neuroectodermal tumor. We report four cases, all of which possessed this translocation as detected by reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction and confirmed by sequencing with or without fluorescent in situ hybridization, but none of which were Ewing sarcoma or peripheral primitive neuroectodermal tumor by histological criteria. Two were polyphenotypic tumors and two were mixed embryonal and alveolar rhabdomyosarcomas. Only one case was positive for MIC2 by immunohistochemistry and only in a rare cell. Two cases (one polyphenotypic tumor and one rhabdomyosarcoma) had double minute chromosomes with > 100 copies of the MDM2 gene. The presence of the t(11;22)(q24;ql2) translocation should probably not be considered diagnostic of Ewing sarcoma and peripheral primitive neuroectodermal tumor in the absence of supporting histological evidence. The presence of this translocation in Ewing sarcoma and peripheral primitive neuroectodermal tumor has been taken as evidence that these two tumors are related. Extending this relationship to include some polyphenotypic tumors and some rhabdomyosarcomas may not be justified unless additional evidence is gathered. Pathologists and oncologists will need to decide whether treatment regimens for tumors are better based on phenotype rather than genotype when these two profiles are seemingly in conflict.

Ewing/PNET (peripheral neuroepithelioma) tumors are rare aggressive bone sarcomas occurring in young people. Rare-disease clinical trials can require global collaborations and many years. In vivo models that as accurately as possible reflect the clinical disease are helpful in selecting therapeutics with the most promise of positive clinical impact. Human Ewing/PNET sarcoma cell lines developed over the past 45 years are described. Several of these have undergone genetic analysis and have been confirmed to be those of Ewing/PNET sarcoma. The A673 Ewing sarcoma line has proven to be particularly useful in understanding the biology of this disease in the mouse. The chromosomal translocation producing the EWS/FLI1 fusion transcript characterizes clinical Ewing sarcoma. Cell lines that express this genetic profile are confirmed to be those of Ewing sarcoma. The A673 Ewing sarcoma line grows in culture and as a xenograft in immunodeficient mice. The A673 model has been used to study Ewing sarcoma angiogenesis and response to antiangiogenic agents. Many Ewing sarcoma clinical specimens express the cell surface protein endosialin. Several Ewing sarcoma cell lines, including the A673 line, also express cell surface endosialin when grown as subcutaneous tumor nodules and as disseminated disease; thus the A673 is a useful model for the study of endosialin biology and endosialin-directed therapies. With the advent of tools that allow characterization of clinical disease to facilitate optimal treatment, it becomes imperative, especially for rare tumors, to develop preclinical models reflecting disease subsets. Ewing PNET sarcomas are a rare disease where models are available.
