IDEAL_ANSWER:
- adalimumab is an anti-tumour necrosis factor (tf)-α antibody.
- Adalimumab is a fully human monoclonal antibody directed against tumor necrosis factor-alpha, a central cytokine in the immune response in psoriasis that has already been shown to be an effective target for therapy. Targeted drugs against key pathogenetic molecules such as TNF-alpha have significantly improved outcomes in rheumatoid arthritis (RA). They are widely used in clinical practice and drug registries give us information to support their use.
- Adalimumab is a fully human anti-TNF-alpha IgG1-κ monoclonal antibody.
- Adalimumab is a fully human monoclonal antibody against TNF-alpha.
- The objective of this study was to assess the relative importance of local versus systemic interactions between adalimumab and tumour necrosis factor (TNF)-α in rheumatoid arthritis (RA), identify localization of the site of adalimumab action and assess the efficacy of local (intra-articular) versus systemic adalimumab administration for treatment of RA
- Adalimumab is a monoclonal antibody that targets TNF-alpha, a central cytokine in the immune response in psoriasis that has been linked to autoimmune disease.
- Adalimumab is a fully human anti-TNF-alpha monoclonal antibody.
- Adalimumab is a fully human monoclonal antibody directed against tumor necrosis factor-alpha, a central cytokine in the immune response in psoriasis that has already been shown to be an effective target for therapy.
- Adalimumab is a human anti-TNFα monoclonal antibody that has been reported to demonstrate clinical efficacy and safety, resulting in reversal of epidermal hyperplasia and cutaneous inflammation. The major pathway of TNFα elimination from the synovial fluid (∼77% for subcutaneous administration, and ∼72% for intravenous and intra-articular administration of adgalimumab 40 mg) is interaction with adalumumab, which reaches the joints following local or systemic administration.
