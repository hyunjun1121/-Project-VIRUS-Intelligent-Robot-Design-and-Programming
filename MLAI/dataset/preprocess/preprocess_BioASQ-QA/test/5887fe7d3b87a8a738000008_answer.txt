IDEAL_ANSWER:
- 3,4-diaminobenzoic acid derivatives are inhibitors of the oxytocinase subfamily of M1 aminopeptidases with immune-regulating properties. Cell-based analysis indicated that the lead compounds can be effective in downregulating macrophage activation induced by lipopolysaccharide and interferon-Î³ as well as cross-presentation by bone marrow-derived dendritic cells.
