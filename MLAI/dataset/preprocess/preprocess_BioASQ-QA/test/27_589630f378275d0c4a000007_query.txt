Which enzyme is inhibited by ixazomib?

[PMID: 27119237]
Ixazomib is an oral proteasome inhibitor that is currently being studied for the treatment of multiple myeloma. In this double-blind, placebo-controlled, phase 3 trial, we randomly assigned 722 patients who had relapsed, refractory, or relapsed and refractory multiple myeloma to receive ixazomib plus lenalidomide-dexamethasone (ixazomib group) or placebo plus lenalidomide-dexamethasone (placebo group). The primary end point was progression-free survival. Progression-free survival was significantly longer in the ixazomib group than in the placebo group at a median follow-up of 14.7 months (median progression-free survival, 20.6 months vs. 14.7 months; hazard ratio for disease progression or death in the ixazomib group, 0.74; P=0.01); a benefit with respect to progression-free survival was observed with the ixazomib regimen, as compared with the placebo regimen, in all prespecified patient subgroups, including in patients with high-risk cytogenetic abnormalities. The overall rates of response were 78% in the ixazomib group and 72% in the placebo group, and the corresponding rates of complete response plus very good partial response were 48% and 39%. The median time to response was 1.1 months in the ixazomib group and 1.9 months in the placebo group, and the corresponding median duration of response was 20.5 months and 15.0 months. At a median follow-up of approximately 23 months, the median overall survival has not been reached in either study group, and follow-up is ongoing. The rates of serious adverse events were similar in the two study groups (47% in the ixazomib group and 49% in the placebo group), as were the rates of death during the study period (4% and 6%, respectively); adverse events of at least grade 3 severity occurred in 74% and 69% of the patients, respectively. Thrombocytopenia of grade 3 and grade 4 severity occurred more frequently in the ixazomib group (12% and 7% of the patients, respectively) than in the placebo group (5% and 4% of the patients, respectively). Rash occurred more frequently in the ixazomib group than in the placebo group (36% vs. 23% of the patients), as did gastrointestinal adverse events, which were predominantly low grade. The incidence of peripheral neuropathy was 27% in the ixazomib group and 22% in the placebo group (grade 3 events occurred in 2% of the patients in each study group). Patient-reported quality of life was similar in the two study groups. The addition of ixazomib to a regimen of lenalidomide and dexamethasone was associated with significantly longer progression-free survival; the additional toxic effects with this all-oral regimen were limited.

Inhibition of the proteasome has emerged as a clinically effective anticancer therapeutic approach in recent years. Bortezomib (Velcade®) showed extremely high potency against a wide range of cancer cell lines. Ixazomib (MLN9708-MLN2238), the second-generation proteasome inhibitor, selectivity and potency were similar to that of bortezomib, is currently being investigated in phase I studies. It shows superior antitumor activity in hematologic malignancy, especially multiple myelomas. In this study, for the first time, we evaluated and compared the antiproliferative and apoptotic effects of the novel proteasome inhibitor MLN2238 (the active form of MLN9708) with bortezomib using in vitro chronic myeloid leukemia. Cytotoxic and apoptotic effects of MLN2238 and bortezomib were determined by trypan blue dye exclusion assays, WST-1 cell proliferation assay, increased AnnexinV-PI binding capacity, changes in caspase-3 activity and loss of mitochondrial membrane potential (JC-1). Associated with proteasome pathway NFκB1 and c-myc mRNA expression levels were examined by the qRT-PCR method. We observed that cytotoxic and apoptotic effects on K562 cells were started at 5 μm of MLN2238 and 1 μm of bortezomib after 24 and 48 h. Also, MLN2238 and bortezomib downregulated NFκB1 and c-myc mRNA expression at 24 h. Our result revealed that MLN22238 and bortezomib had significant cytotoxic and apoptotic effects on K562 cells. Here, we first demonstrate in vitro data that support the development of MLN2238, by direct comparison with bortezomib on K562 cells.

The aim of the present study was to characterize the pharmacokinetics of the oral proteasome inhibitor, ixazomib, in patients with solid tumours and moderate or severe hepatic impairment, to provide posology recommendations. Eligible adults with advanced malignancies for which no further effective therapy was available received a single dose of ixazomib on day 1 of the pharmacokinetic cycle; patients with normal hepatic function, moderate hepatic impairment or severe hepatic impairment received 4 mg, 2.3 mg or 1.5 mg, respectively. Blood samples for single-dose pharmacokinetic characterization were collected over 336 h postdose. After sampling, patients could continue to receive ixazomib on days 1, 8 and 15 in 28-day cycles. Of 48 enrolled patients (13, 15 and 20 in the normal, moderate and severe groups, respectively), 43 were pharmacokinetics-evaluable. Ixazomib was rapidly absorbed (median time to reach peak concentration was 0.95-1.5 h) and highly bound to plasma proteins, with a similar mean fraction bound (~99%) across the three groups. In patients with moderate/severe hepatic impairment (combined group), the geometric least squares mean ratios (90% confidence interval) for unbound and total dose-normalized area under the plasma concentration vs. time curve from time zero to the time of the last quantifiable concentration in reference to the normal hepatic function group were 1.27 (0.75, 2.16) and 1.20 (0.79, 1.82), respectively. Seven (15%) of the 48 patients experienced a grade 3 drug-related adverse event; there were no drug-related grade 4 adverse events. In patients with moderate/severe hepatic impairment, unbound and total systemic exposures of ixazomib were 27% and 20% higher, respectively, vs. normal hepatic function. A reduced ixazomib starting dose of 3 mg is recommended for patients with moderate or severe hepatic impairment.

Ixazomib (Ninlaro(®)) is an orally bioavailable, reversible proteasome inhibitor developed by Millennium Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (now Takeda Oncology). Ixazomib acts by binding to and inhibiting the β5 subunit of the 20S proteasome. In November 2015, the US FDA approved ixazomib for use in combination with lenalidomide and dexamethasone for the treatment of patients with multiple myeloma who have received at least one prior therapy. Ixazomib is under regulatory review for this indication in the EU. Phase III development of ixazomib is underway worldwide for newly-diagnosed multiple myeloma (in patients who are not eligible for stem cell transplant, or as maintenance therapy) and for relapsed or refractory systemic light chain (AL) amyloidosis. Ixazomib is also under phase I-II development for the treatment of several other haematological and non-haematological malignancies, graft-versus-host disease and lupus nephritis. This article summarizes the milestones in the development of ixazomib leading to this first approval for multiple myeloma.

This population pharmacokinetic analysis of the investigational oral proteasome inhibitor ixazomib assessed the feasibility of switching from body surface area (BSA)-based to fixed dosing, and the impact of baseline covariates on ixazomib pharmacokinetics. Data were pooled from 226 adult patients with multiple myeloma, lymphoma or solid tumours in four phase 1 studies, in which ixazomib dosing (oral/intravenous, once/twice weekly) was based on BSA. Population pharmacokinetic modelling was undertaken using nonmem version 7.2. Ixazomib pharmacokinetics were well described by a three compartment model with first order absorption and linear elimination. Ixazomib was absorbed rapidly (Ka 0.5 h(-1)), with dose- and time-independent pharmacokinetics. Estimated absolute bioavailability and clearance were 60% and 2l h(-1), respectively. Although a small effect of BSA (range 1.3-2.6 m(2)) was observed on the peripheral volume of distribution (V4), reducing the corresponding inter-individual variability by 12.9%, there was no relationship between BSA and ixazomib clearance (the parameter that dictates total systemic exposure following fixed dosing). Consistently, based on simulations (n = 1000), median AUCs (including interquartile range) were similar after BSA-based (2.23 mg m(-2)) and fixed (4 mg) oral dosing with no trend in simulated AUC vs. BSA for fixed dosing (P = 0.42). No other covariates, including creatinine clearance (22-213.7 ml min(-1)) and age (23-86 years), influenced ixazomib pharmacokinetics. This analysis supports a switch from BSA-based to fixed dosing, without dose modification for mild/moderate renal impairment or age, in future adult studies of ixazomib, simplifying dosing guidance and clinical development.

Proteasome-regulated NF-κB has been shown to be important for cell survival in T-cell lymphoma and Hodgkin lymphoma models. Several new small-molecule proteasome inhibitors are under various stages of active preclinical and clinical development. We completed a comprehensive preclinical examination of the efficacy and associated biologic effects of a second-generation proteasome inhibitor, ixazomib, in T-cell lymphoma and Hodgkin lymphoma cells and in vivo SCID mouse models. We demonstrated that ixazomib induced potent cell death in all cell lines at clinically achievable concentrations. In addition, it significantly inhibited tumor growth and improved survival in T-cell lymphoma and Hodgkin lymphoma human lymphoma xenograft models. Through global transcriptome analyses, proteasomal inhibition showed conserved overlap in downregulation of cell cycle, chromatin modification, and DNA repair processes in ixazomib-sensitive lymphoma cells. The predicted activity for tumor suppressors and oncogenes, the impact on "hallmarks of cancer," and the analysis of key significant genes from global transcriptome analysis for ixazomib strongly favored tumor inhibition via downregulation of MYC and CHK1, its target genes. Furthermore, in ixazomib-treated lymphoma cells, we identified that CHK1 was involved in the regulation of MYC expression through chromatin modification involving histone H3 acetylation via chromatin immunoprecipitation. Finally, using pharmacologic and RNA silencing of CHK1 or the associated MYC-related mechanism, we demonstrated synergistic cell death in combination with antiproteasome therapy. Altogether, ixazomib significantly downregulates MYC and induces potent cell death in T-cell lymphoma and Hodgkin lymphoma, and we identified that combinatorial therapy with anti-CHK1 treatment represents a rational and novel therapeutic approach.

There is a need for new immunosuppression strategies to minimize calcineurin inhibitor (CNI) toxicity while effectively preventing antibody-mediated rejection (AMR). We tested the efficacy of an investigational proteasome inhibitor, ixazomib, alone and in a CNI minimization strategy in a rat kidney transplant model of transfusion-elicited acute AMR. Nonsensitized (naïve) and sensitized allograft recipients were randomized into 4 treatment groups (8 groups total, n = 3 to 6 in each group) and treated for 1 week. Groups included: no treatment, full dose cyclosporine (CsA, 10 mg/kg per day), ixazomib (0.25 mg/kg on days -5, -2 and +2) alone, and half dose CsA (5 mg/kg per day) + ixazomib. Compared to untreated animals, ixazomib alone or in combination with ½ dose CsA reduced donor-specific antibody, intragraft transcripts for chemokines CCL-21 and CXCL-13, and CD19 expression in both sensitized and naïve transplants. Compared to full dose CsA, the CNI minimization strategy with ixazomib inhibited AMR and allograft injury as evidenced by reduced C4d staining in peritubular capillaries, microcirculation inflammation, splenic plasma cells, circulating B cell activating factor, and intragraft transcripts for major histocompatibility complex class II, Toll-like receptors (TLR-1, TLR-10, and TLR-12) and CCL-21 and CXCL-13 in sensitized animals, indicating downregulation of B cell activation, antigen presentation and T-cell and B-cell signaling. These studies suggest that CNI minimization strategies including ixazomib are effective to prevent AMR including in sensitized kidney allograft recipients. Clinical studies are needed to determine the role of novel proteasome inhibitors for the prevention and treatment of AMR.

The development of proteasome inhibitors (PIs) and immunomodulatory drugs has significantly improved outcomes for patients with relapsed/refractory multiple myeloma (RRMM); however, not all patients benefit from treatment with these agents and some patients can become drug refractory over time. Due to the largely incurable nature of multiple myeloma, the development of newer agents is ongoing and includes new oral PIs (ixazomib), immunotherapies (e.g., CD38- or SLAMF7-targeted antibodies), and small molecules. This review provides an overview of the advances in targeted therapy for patients with RRMM, including recently approved agents, with a focus on monotherapy and combined targeted therapies.

Evading apoptosis is a cancer hallmark that remains a serious obstacle in current treatment approaches. Although proteasome inhibitors (PIs) have transformed management of multiple myeloma (MM), drug resistance emerges through induction of the aggresome+autophagy pathway as a compensatory protein clearance mechanism. Genome-wide profiling identified microRNAs (miRs) differentially expressed in bortezomib-resistant myeloma cells compared with drug-naive cells. The effect of individual miRs on proteasomal degradation of short-lived fluorescent reporter proteins was then determined in live cells. MiR-29b was significantly reduced in bortezomib-resistant cells as well as in cells resistant to second-generation PIs carfilzomib and ixazomib. Luciferase reporter assays demonstrated that miR-29b targeted PSME4 that encodes the proteasome activator PA200. Synthetically engineered miR-29b replacements impaired the growth of myeloma cells, patient tumor cells and xenotransplants. MiR-29b replacements also decreased PA200 association with proteasomes, reduced the proteasome's peptidase activity and inhibited ornithine decarboxylase turnover, a proteasome substrate degraded through ubiquitin-independent mechanisms. Immunofluorescence studies revealed that miR-29b replacements enhanced the bortezomib-induced accumulation of ubiquitinated proteins but did not reveal aggresome or autophagosome formation. Taken together, our study identifies miR-29b replacements as the first-in-class miR-based PIs that also disrupt the autophagy pathway and highlight their potential to synergistically enhance the antimyeloma effect of bortezomib.

In non-clinical studies, the proteasome inhibitor ixazomib inhibits cell growth in a broad panel of solid tumor cell lines in vitro. In contrast, antitumor activity in xenograft tumors is model-dependent, with some solid tumors showing no response to ixazomib. In this study we examined factors responsible for ixazomib sensitivity or resistance using mouse xenograft models. A survey of 14 non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) and 6 colon xenografts showed a striking relationship between ixazomib activity and KRAS genotype; tumors with wild-type (WT) KRAS were more sensitive to ixazomib than tumors harboring KRAS activating mutations. To confirm the association between KRAS genotype and ixazomib sensitivity, we used SW48 isogenic colon cancer cell lines. Either KRAS-G13D or KRAS-G12V mutations were introduced into KRAS-WT SW48 cells to generate cells that stably express activated KRAS. SW48 KRAS WT tumors, but neither SW48-KRAS-G13D tumors nor SW48-KRAS-G12V tumors, were sensitive to ixazomib in vivo. Since activated KRAS is known to be associated with metabolic reprogramming, we compared metabolite profiling of SW48-WT and SW48-KRAS-G13D tumors treated with or without ixazomib. Prior to treatment there were significant metabolic differences between SW48 WT and SW48-KRAS-G13D tumors, reflecting higher oxidative stress and glucose utilization in the KRAS-G13D tumors. Ixazomib treatment resulted in significant metabolic regulation, and some of these changes were specific to KRAS WT tumors. Depletion of free amino acid pools and activation of GCN2-eIF2α-pathways were observed both in tumor types. However, changes in lipid beta oxidation were observed in only the KRAS WT tumors. The non-clinical data presented here show a correlation between KRAS genotype and ixazomib sensitivity in NSCLC and colon xenografts and provide new evidence of regulation of key metabolic pathways by proteasome inhibition.

Proteasome inhibition is a mainstay in the treatment of multiple myeloma (MM). Bortezomib, the first proteasome inhibitor (PI) approved for MM therapy, has shown efficacy in relapsed/refractory patients and in the front-line setting. Among second-generation PIs, MLN9708 ( ixazomib ) is the first oral compound to be evaluated in MM treatment and has shown improvement in pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic parameters compared with bortezomib with a similar efficacy in the control of myeloma growth and in the prevention of bone loss. In this review, the authors discuss the rationale for use of PIs. They then summarize the clinical development of ixazomib in MM, from initial Phase I to Phase II studies as a monotherapy and in combination with other chemotherapeutics. Preliminary data of Phase I/II trials showed that ixazomib had a good safety profile and exerted anti-myeloma activity as a single agent in relapsed/refractory patients. Furthermore, ixazomib also had efficacy in patients who were refractory to bortezomib. Its use in combination with lenalidomide and dexamethasone was shown to be an effective and well-tolerated regimen in up-front treatment leading to minimal residual disease negativity in a significant number of patients. Results of Phase III trials, evaluating ixazomib in induction or maintenance therapy, are awaited.

Continuous therapy has proven to be an effective therapeutic strategy to improve the outcome of both young and elderly multiple myeloma patients. Remarkably, lenalidomide and bortezomib showed to play a crucial role in this setting due to their safety profile allowing long-term exposure. Ixazomib, the first oral proteasome inhibitor to be evaluated in multiple myeloma, exerts substantial anti-myeloma activity as a single agent and particularly in combination with immunomodulatory drugs and it may be an attractive option for maintenance therapy. Here we address the issue of maintenance therapy as part of a therapeutic approach of multiple myeloma patients focusing on the potential role of ixazomib.

In the last few weeks, the FDA approved three new therapies for multiple myeloma: ixazomib, the first oral proteasome inhibitor; and daratumumab and elotuzumab, two monoclonal antibodies that target CD38 and SLAMF7, respectively.

The ubiquitin-proteasome signaling pathway is critical for cell cycle regulation and neoplastic growth. Proteasome inhibition can activate apoptotic pathways. Bortezomib, a selective proteasome inhibitor, has anti-melanoma activity. MLN2238 (ixazomib), an oral proteasome inhibitor, has improved pharmacotherapeutic parameters compared to bortezomib. Interferon-alpha (IFN-α), an immune boosting agent, is FDA-approved for treatment of melanoma. In this study in vitro and in vivo evaluation of the antitumor potential of ixazomib and combination treatments with ixazomib and IFN-α were performed. Apoptosis induced by ixazomib was first observed at 12 hours and was maximal at 48 hours with similar levels of cell death compared to bortezomib. IFN-α alone had little effect on cell viability in vitro. However, the combination of ixazomib with IFN-α significantly enhanced ixazomib's ability to induce apoptotic cell death in BRAF V600E mutant and BRAF wild-type human melanoma tumor cells. The combination of ixazomib and IFN-α also enhanced inhibition of cell proliferation in BRAF V600E mutant melanoma tumor cells; however, this was not seen in BRAF wild-type cells. Ixazomib-induced apoptosis was associated with processing of the pro-apoptotic proteins procaspase-3, -7, -8, and -9, and cleavage of poly-ADP-ribose polymerase (PARP). In an in vivo xenograft model of human melanoma, combination treatment with IFN-α-2b and ixazomib demonstrated a significant reduction in tumor volume when compared to vehicle (p = 0.005) and single therapy ixazomib (p = 0.017) and IFN-α-2b (p = 0.036). These pre-clinical results support further evaluation of combination treatment with ixazomib and IFN-α for the treatment of advanced BRAF V600E mutant melanoma.

Firefly luciferase-based reporter gene assays are the most commonly used assays to investigate the transcriptional regulation of gene expression. However, direct interaction of tested compounds with the firefly luciferase leading to altered enzymatic activity may lead to misinterpretation of experimental data. When investigating the proteasome inhibitors bortezomib, carfilzomib, and ixazomib, we observed increased luminescence for bortezomib and ixazomib, but not for carfilzomib, in a pregnane-X-receptor (PXR) reporter gene assay, which was inconsistent with the mRNA expression levels of the main PXR target gene CYP3A4. To further scrutinize this phenomenon, we performed experiments with constitutively expressed firefly luciferase and demonstrated that the increase in cellular firefly luciferase activity is independent from PXR activation or CYP3A4 promoter. Using cell-free assays with recombinant firefly luciferase enzyme, we made the counterintuitive observation that firefly luciferase activity is inhibited by bortezomib and ixazomib in a reversible and competitive manner. This inhibition stabilizes the firefly luciferase enzyme against proteolytic degradation (e.g., toward trypsin), thereby increasing its half-life with subsequent enhancement of total cellular luminescence that eventually mimicked PXR-driven luciferase induction. These data show that particular compounds can strikingly interfere with firefly luciferase and once more illustrate the importance of careful interpretation of data obtained from luciferase-based assays.

Ixazomib is the first oral, proteasome inhibitor to reach phase III trials. Here, we present an integrated nonclinical and clinical assessment of ixazomib's effect on QTc intervals. Nonclinical studies assessed (1) the in vitro binding of ixazomib to the hERG channel and (2) its effect on QT/QTc in dogs (N = 4) via telemetry. Pharmacokinetic-matched triplicate electrocardiograms were collected in four clinical phase I studies of intravenous (0.125-3.11 mg/m(2), N = 125, solid tumors/lymphoma) or oral (0.24-3.95 mg/m(2), N = 120, multiple myeloma) ixazomib. The relationship between ixazomib plasma concentration and heart rate (HR)-corrected QT using Fridericia (QTcF) or population (QTcP) methods was analyzed using linear mixed-effects models with fixed effects for day and time. In vitro binding potency for ixazomib to the hERG channel was weak (K i 24.9 μM; IC50 59.6 μM), and nonclinical telemetry studies showed no QT/QTc prolongation at doses up to 4.2 mg/m(2). In cancer patients, ixazomib, when evaluated at doses yielding various plasma concentrations (with 26 % of data greater than mean C max for the 4 mg phase 3 dose), had no meaningful effect on QTc based on model-predicted mean change in QTcF/QTcP from baseline. There was no relationship between ixazomib concentration and RR, suggesting no effect on HR. Ixazomib has no clinically meaningful effects on QTc or HR. Integrating preclinical data and concentration-QTc modeling of phase 1 data may obviate the need for a dedicated QTc study in oncology. A framework for QT assessment in oncology drug development is proposed.

Medicinal chemists try to avoid certain organic functional groups, summarized in an ever-growing list, in order to avoid the potential bioactivation to reactive metabolites. To add to that alert list, we report herein that boronic acid-containing compound structures, such as those found in proteasome inhibitors bortezomib and ixazomib, can become bioactivated to chemically reactive imine amide metabolites. Test compounds, ixazomib and bortezomib, were incubated in vitro using human liver fractions containing cytosol and microsomes (S9) under conventional conditions in the presence of GSH. Metabolites were then analyzed using LC-MS(n) with or without online hydrogen-deuterium exchange (HDX) liquid chromatography coupled with an LTQ-Orbitrap. The exact mass measurements of both the precursor and product ions were acquired through data dependent acquisition and compared with theoretical values of proposed fragment ions. Upon deboronation catalyzed by cytochrome P450 enzymes, both test compounds formed imine amide metabolites that were identified by high resolution exact mass measurements in both normal aqueous and HDX HPLC-MS analysis. GSH conjugates were also identified and were postulated as nucleophilic addition of GSH to the imine amide metabolites. All mass spectrometric and HDX measurements of these GSH conjugates proved that the GSH unit was added to the carbon atom of the imine amide partial structure, hence demonstrating the electrophilic property of these imine amide metabolites. The awareness of the formation of electrophilic imine amide metabolites from boronic acid-containing compounds, where the boron atom is bonded to a carbon atom adjacent to an amide nitrogen, should help in drug candidate design and optimization with regard to avoiding potential bioactivation.

Ixazomib is the first oral proteasome inhibitor to be investigated in the clinic. This clinical study assessed whether the pharmacokinetics of ixazomib would be altered if administered after a high-calorie, high-fat meal. In a 2-period, 2-sequence, crossover study design, adult patients with advanced solid tumors or lymphoma received a 4-mg oral dose of ixazomib as immediate-release capsules on day 1 without food (fasted, administered following an overnight fast) or with food (fed, following consumption of a high-calorie, high-fat meal), followed by another dose on day 15 in the alternate food intake condition (fasted to fed or fed to fasted). Twenty-four patients were enrolled; of these, 15 were included in the pharmacokinetic-evaluable population. Administration of ixazomib after a high-fat meal reduced both the rate and extent of absorption of ixazomib. Under fed conditions, the median time to peak plasma concentration (Tmax ) of ixazomib was delayed by approximately 3 hours compared with administration in the fasted state (1.02 hours vs 4.0 hours), and there was a 28% reduction in total systemic exposure (area under the curve, AUC) and a 69% reduction in peak plasma concentration (Cmax ). Together, the results support the administration of ixazomib on an empty stomach, at least 1 hour before or at least 2 hours after food. These recommendations are reflected in the United States Prescribing Information for ixazomib (clinicaltrials.gov identifier NCT01454076).

Multiple myeloma (MM) is a malignant plasma cell disorder, clinically characterized by osteolytic lesions, immunodeficiency, and renal disease. Over the past decade, MM therapy is significantly improved by the introduction of novel therapeutics such as immunomodulatory agents (thalidomide, lenalidomide, and pomalidomide), proteasome inhibitors (bortezomib, carfilzomib, and ixazomib), monoclonal antibodies (daratumumab and elotuzumab), histone deacetylase (HDAC) inhibitors (Panobinostat). The clinical success of these agents has clearly identified vulnerabilities intrinsic to the MM cell, as well as targets that emanate from the tumor microenvironment. Despite these significant improvements, MM remains incurable due to the development of drug resistance. This perspective will discuss more recent strategies which take advantage of multiple targets within the proteome recycling pathway, chromatin remodeling, and disruption of nuclear export. In addition, we will review the development of strategies designed to block opportunistic survival signaling that occurs between the MM cell and the tumor microenvironment including strategies for inhibiting myeloma-induced immune suppression. It has become clear that MM tumors continue to evolve on therapy leading to drug resistance. It will be important to understand the emerging drug resistant mechanisms and additional vulnerabilities that occur due to the development of clinical resistance. J. Cell.

The oral proteasome inhibitor ixazomib is under phase 3 clinical investigation in multiple myeloma (MM) in combination with lenalidomide-dexamethasone. This study was conducted to investigate the pharmacokinetic and safety profiles of ixazomib, administered with lenalidomide-dexamethasone, in East Asian patients with relapsed/refractory MM. Adult patients with measurable disease who had received 1-3 prior lines of therapy received oral ixazomib on days 1, 8, and 15, lenalidomide (25 mg) on days 1-21, and dexamethasone (40 mg) on days 1, 8, 15, and 22, in 28-day cycles. Primary objectives were to characterize ixazomib plasma pharmacokinetics, determine the recommended phase 2/3 dose, and evaluate safety and tolerability. Forty-three patients were enrolled. No dose-limiting toxicities were reported for the first six patients receiving ixazomib (4.0 mg), confirming this as the recommended phase 2/3 dose. Ixazomib was rapidly absorbed with a median T max of 1.5 h on day 1 and 2.0 h on day 15 of cycle 1 and had a geometric mean terminal half-life of 6.1 days. Twenty-one (49%) patients had at least one drug-related grade ≥3 adverse event (AE); the most common were neutropenia (19%), diarrhea (14%), and thrombocytopenia (12%). Twenty-eight of 43 (65%) response-evaluable patients had at least a partial response. The recommended phase 2/3 dose for ixazomib was determined to be 4.0 mg. The all-oral combination of ixazomib plus lenalidomide-dexamethasone appeared active and well tolerated at 4.0 mg. Consequently, East Asian patients enrolled in phase 3 studies are receiving the same ixazomib dose as patients in other regions. This study is registered at NCT01645930.

The combination of bortezomib, lenalidomide, and dexamethasone is a highly effective therapy for newly diagnosed multiple myeloma. Ixazomib is an investigational, oral, proteasome inhibitor with promising anti-myeloma effects and low rates of peripheral neuropathy. In a phase 1/2 trial we aimed to assess the safety, tolerability, and activity of ixazomib in combination with lenalidomide and dexamethasone in newly diagnosed multiple myeloma. We enrolled patients newly diagnosed with multiple myeloma aged 18 years or older with measurable disease, Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status 0-2, and no grade 2 or higher peripheral neuropathy, and treated them with oral ixazomib (days 1, 8, 15) plus lenalidomide 25 mg (days 1-21) and dexamethasone 40 mg (days 1, 8, 15, 22) for up to 12 28-day cycles, followed by maintenance therapy with ixazomib alone. In phase 1, we gave patients escalating doses of ixazomib (1·68-3·95 mg/m(2)) to establish the recommended dose for phase 2. The primary endpoints were maximum tolerated dose for phase 1, and the rate of very good partial response or better for phase 2. Safety analyses were done in all patients who received at least one dose of study drug; efficacy analyses were done in all patients who received at least one dose of study drug at the phase 2 dose, had measurable disease at baseline, and had at least one post-baseline response assessment. This study is registered at ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT01217957. Between Nov 22, 2010, and Feb 28, 2012, we enrolled 65 patients (15 to phase 1 and 50 to phase 2). Four dose-limiting toxic events were noted in phase 1: one at a dose of ixazomib of 2·97 mg/m(2) and three at 3·95 mg/m(2). The maximum tolerated dose of ixazomib was established as 2·97 mg/m(2) and the recommended phase 2 dose was 2·23 mg/m(2), which was converted to a 4·0 mg fixed dose based on population pharmacokinetic results. Grade 3 or higher adverse events related to any drug were reported in 41 (63%) patients, including skin and subcutaneous tissue disorders (11 patients, 17%), neutropenia (eight patients, 12%), and thrombocytopenia (five patients, 8%); drug-related peripheral neuropathy of grade 3 or higher occurred in four (6%) patients. Five patients discontinued because of adverse events. In 64 response-evaluable patients, 37 (58%, 95% CI 45-70) had a very good partial response or better. The all-oral combination of weekly ixazomib plus lenalidomide and dexamethasone was generally well tolerated and appeared active in newly diagnosed multiple myeloma. These results support the phase 3 trial development of this combination for multiple myeloma. Millennium Pharmaceuticals, a wholly owned subsidiary of Takeda Pharmaceutical International Company.

Proteasome inhibitors have become an integral part of myeloma therapy. Considerable efforts have gone into optimizing this therapeutic approach to obtain maximal proteasome inhibition with least toxicity. Ixazomib is the first oral proteasome inhibitor to enter the clinic and has been studied as a single agent as well as in various combinations. The current trial was designed to examine the efficacy and toxicity of combining 2 different doses of ixazomib (4 mg and 5.5 mg given weekly for 3 of 4 weeks) with 40 mg weekly of dexamethasone, in relapsed myeloma. Seventy patients were enrolled, 35 patients randomly assigned to each ixazomib dose. Overall, 30 (43%; 95% confidence interval, 31-55) of the patients achieved a confirmed partial response or better, with 31% achieving a response with 4 mg and 54% with 5.5 mg of ixazomib. The median event-free survival (EFS) for the entire study population was 8.4 months; 1-year overall survival was 96%. The EFS was 5.7 months for patients with prior bortezomib exposure and 11.0 months for bortezomib-naïve patients. A grade 3 or 4 adverse event considered at least possibly related to treatment was seen in 11 (32%) patients at 4 mg and in 21 (60%) at 5.5 mg. Dose reductions were more frequent with 5.5 mg dose. Overall, the ixazomib with dexamethasone has good efficacy in relapsed myeloma, is well-tolerated and with higher response rate at 5.5 mg, albeit with more toxicity. This study was registered at www.clinicaltrials.gov as #NCT01415882.

Despite the significant therapeutic advances achieved with proteasome inhibitors (PIs) such as bortezomib and carfilzomib in prolonging the survival of patients with multiple myeloma, the development of drug resistance, peripheral neuropathy, and pharmacokinetic limitations continue to pose major challenges when using these compounds. Ixazomib is a second-generation PI with improved activity over other PIs. Unlike bortezomib and carfilzomib, which are administered by injection, ixazomib is the first oral PI approved by US Food and Drug Administration. This review discusses the biochemical properties, mechanisms of action, preclinical efficacy, and clinical trial results leading to the US Food and Drug Administration approval of ixazomib.

This study was performed to determine whether the investigational proteasome inhibitor ixazomib demonstrated selective antineoplastic activity against acute myelogenous leukemia cells expressing a mutated nucleophosmin-1 gene and to gain a better understanding of its mechanisms of action. The cytotoxic effects of ixazomib treatment were analyzed in human acute myelogenous leukemia (AML) cell lines and primary AML samples expressing wild-type or mutated NPM1 (NPMc(+)). The potential roles of oxidative stress in mediating cytotoxic activity were determined using flow cytometry, enzyme-based assays, and Western blots. Apoptosis induced by ixazomib was abrogated by knockdown of NPM1/NPMc(+)expression using an inducible shRNA construct and enhanced by NPMc(+)overexpression. Cytotoxicity was associated with superoxide generation and was reduced by the addition of the antioxidant N-acetylcysteine. AML cells expressing NPMc(+)had significantly reduced levels of intracellular glutathione and NADPH associated with reduced antioxidant responses to drug treatment. Treatment of 3 patients with relapsed NPMc(+)AML resulted in an antileukemic effect in 1 patient as demonstrated by a marked reduction of leukemic blasts in the peripheral blood. Efficacy was associated with superoxide generation, reduced glutathione levels, and reduced mRNA and protein expression of antioxidant effectors in responding cells. In this study, a direct association was observed between NPMc(+)expression in AML, reduced antioxidant responses, and enhanced sensitivity to an oral proteasome inhibitor that induces oxidative stress. These data suggest that intracellular determinants of antioxidant responses may be good predictors of therapeutic response to ixazomib.

Proteasomes are multisubunit enzyme complexes. They contain three enzymatic active sites which are termed chymotrypsin-like, trypsin-like, and caspase-like. The elementary function of the proteasomes is degradation of damaged proteins. Proteasome inhibition leads to accumulation of damaged protein, which leads to caspase activation and cell death. This relationship is used in cancer therapy. Bortezomib is the first proteasome inhibitor approved by the US Food and Drug Administration for the treatment of relapsed/refractory multiple myeloma. Carfilzomib belongs to the second generation of drugs, which was approved by the US FDA in 2012. Currently in the study phase there are four new inhibitors: ixazomib (MLN9780/MLN2238), delanzomib (CEP-18770), oprozomib (ONX0912/PR-047) and marizomib (NPI-0052).

Proteasome inhibition represents one of the more important therapeutic targets in the treatment of multiple myeloma (MM), since by suppressing nuclear factor-κB activity, which promotes myelomagenesis, it makes plasma cells susceptible to proapoptotic signals. Bortezomib, the first proteasome inhibitor approved for MM therapy, has been shown to increase response rate and improve outcome in patients with relapsed/refractory disease and in the frontline setting, particularly when combined with immunomodulatory drugs and alkylating agents. Among second-generation proteasome inhibitors, ixazomib (MLN9708) is the first oral compound to be evaluated for the treatment of MM. Ixazomib has shown improved pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic parameters compared with bortezomib, in addition to similar efficacy in the control of myeloma growth and prevention of bone loss. Ixazomib was found to overcome bortezomib resistance and to trigger synergistic antimyeloma activity with dexamethasone, lenalidomide, and histone deacetylase inhibitors. Phase I/II studies using ixazomib weekly or twice weekly in relapsed/refractory MM patients suggested antitumor activity of the single agent, but more promising results have been obtained with the combination of ixazomib, lenalidomide, and dexamethasone in newly diagnosed MM. Ixazomib has also been used in systemic amyloidosis as a single agent, showing important activity in this difficult-to-treat plasma-cell dyscrasia. More frequent side effects observed during administration of ixazomib were thrombocytopenia, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, fatigue, and rash, whereas severe peripheral neuropathy was rare. Here, we review the chemical characteristics of ixazomib, as well as its mechanism of action and results from preclinical and clinical trials.

Bone disease is a characteristic feature of multiple myeloma, a malignant plasma cell dyscrasia. In patients with multiple myeloma, the normal process of bone remodeling is dysregulated by aberrant bone marrow plasma cells, resulting in increased bone resorption, prevention of new bone formation, and consequent bone destruction. The ubiquitin-proteasome system, which is hyperactive in patients with multiple myeloma, controls the catabolism of several proteins that regulate bone remodeling. Clinical studies have reported that treatment with the first-in-class proteasome inhibitor bortezomib reduces bone resorption and increases bone formation and bone mineral density in patients with multiple myeloma. Since the introduction of bortezomib in 2003, several next-generation proteasome inhibitors have also been used clinically, including carfilzomib, oprozomib, ixazomib, and delanzomib. This review summarizes the available preclinical and clinical evidence regarding the effect of proteasome inhibitors on bone remodeling in multiple myeloma.
