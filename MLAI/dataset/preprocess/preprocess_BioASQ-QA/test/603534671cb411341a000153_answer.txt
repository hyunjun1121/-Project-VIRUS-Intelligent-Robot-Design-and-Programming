IDEAL_ANSWER:
- msDNA is actually a complex of DNA, RNA, and probably protein. It is composed of a small, single-stranded DNA, linked to a small, single-stranded RNA molecule. The 5' end of the DNA molecule is joined to an internal guanosine residue of the RNA molecule by a unique 2'-5' phosphodiester bond. msDNA is produced in many hundreds of copies per cell, but its function remains unknown.
