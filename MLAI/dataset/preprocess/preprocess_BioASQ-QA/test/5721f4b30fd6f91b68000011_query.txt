Which inherited disorder is known to be caused by mutations in the NEMO gene?

[PMID: 22036144]
Incontinentia pigmenti (IP) is a rare neurocutaneous disorder with a frequency of 1 in 50,000 newborn, and is associated with mutations in IKBKG gene (NEMO) in Xq28, inherited as an X-linked dominant trait. Clinical manifestations detected since the newborn period are highly variable, with 3 well established sequential or overlapped states and each with a characteristic differential diagnosis. With PCR+RFLPs, we analyzed the IKBKG gene in 4 patients with different clinical manifestations and characteristic skin biopsy. In all 4 patients the same deletion of exons 4 to 10 was identified. In female patients in whom the dermatological lesions lead to the suspicion of an IP diagnosis, it is important to have the complete, multidisciplinary and molecular analysis of their first level female relatives. This should give us a clear diagnosis, which is the first step to complete genetic counselling.

Incontinentia pigmenti (IP) is a rare, inherited, multisystem genodermatosis. It is transmitted as an X-linked dominant trait. The disorder is a consequence of mutations in the NEMO gene (Xq28) that completely abolish expression of the NF-kappaB essential modulator. Here we present a female infant of healthy nonconsanguinous, young parents with a clinically evident first phase of IP. PCR analysis of patient's peripheral blood lymphocytes DNA was done for detection of NEMO delta4-10 deletion. Skin changes present at birth appertain to first inflammatory stage. However, a pathohistological feature of the skin biopsy showed second phase of disease. Genetic testing of diseased child revealed delta4-10 in NEMO gene. However, the assumption that the female child has familial IP was rejected as PCR performed on the mother's leukocytes did not record the presence of the same mutation. Moreover, the existence of a healthy male infant of the same mother as well as the lack of any phenotypic signs of the disease in other family members additionally support that IP was not inherited, but it was a consequence of de novo NEMO gene mutation. In conclusion, here we describe a Croatian female with clinical IP phenotype having de novo genomic rearrangements in the NEMO gene.

Amorphic mutations in the NF- kappa B essential modulator (NEMO) cause X-dominant incontinentia pigmenti, which is lethal in males in utero, whereas hypomorphic mutations cause X-recessive anhidrotic ectodermal dysplasia with immunodeficiency, a complex developmental disorder and life-threatening primary immunodeficiency. We characterized the NEMO mutation 110_111insC, which creates the most-upstream premature translation termination codon (at codon position 49) of any known NEMO mutation. Surprisingly, this mutation is associated with a pure immunodeficiency. We solve this paradox by showing that a Kozakian methionine codon located immediately downstream from the insertion allows the reinitiation of translation. The residual production of an NH(2)-truncated NEMO protein was sufficient for normal fetal development and for the subsequent normal development of skin appendages but was insufficient for the development of protective immune responses.

Mutations in the inhibitor of kappa light polypeptide gene enhancer in B-cells, kinase gamma (IKBKG), also called nuclear factor-kappaB (NF-kB) essential modulator (NEMO), gene are the most common single cause of incontinentia pigmenti (IP) in females and anhydrotic ectodermal dysplasia with immunodeficiency (EDA-ID) in males. The IKBKG gene, located in the Xq28 chromosomal region, encodes for the regulatory subunit of the inhibitor of kappaB (IkB) kinase (IKK) complex required for the activation of the NF-kB pathway. Therefore, the remarkably heterogeneous and often severe clinical presentation reported in IP is due to the pleiotropic role of this signaling transcription pathway. A recurrent exon 4_10 genomic rearrangement in the IKBKG gene accounts for 60 to 80% of IP-causing mutations. Besides the IKBKG rearrangement found in IP females (which is lethal in males), a total of 69 different small mutations (missense, frameshift, nonsense, and splice-site mutations) have been reported, including 13 novel ones in this work. The updated distribution of all the IP- and EDA-ID-causing mutations along the IKBKG gene highlights a secondary hotspot mutation in exon 10, which contains only 11% of the protein. Furthermore, familial inheritance analysis revealed an unexpectedly high incidence of sporadic cases (>65%). The sum of the observations can aid both in determining the molecular basis of IP and EDA-ID allelic diseases, and in genetic counseling in affected families.

Inherited distubances in skin structure and its function are the main cause of diseases classified as genodermatoses. The following clinical entities are classified as genodermatoses: epidermolysis bullosa, keratotic disorders, disorders of skin color, ectodermal genodermatoses, genodermatoses associated with connective tissue, vascular genodermatoses and genodermatoses with skin manifestation and elevated cancer risk. One of the most clinically heterogenous group of genodermatoses, is epidermolysis bullosa. Four main subtypes were described: simplex, dystrophic, junctional and Kindler syndrome. These diseases are caused by mutations in the genes encoding proteins forming junctions between the dermis and epidermis (eg. COL7A1, COL17A1, KRT14, KRT5 or genes coding for 332 laminin). They are inherited in an autosomal recessive or dominant manner. The disease that is inherited as a dominant, sex dependent trait, is incontinenia pigmenti (Bloch-Sulzberger syndrome) characterized by the presence of extensive pigmentation changes already in the neonatal period. In patients with incontinenia pigmenti, mutations in the NEMO gene are found. The protein encoded by NEMO is involved in the negative regulation of activity of the NFκB transcription factor that is responsible for apoptosis and cell proliferation control. In the regulation of cell proliferation, the neurofibromin (NF1) - the suppressor of RAS/MAPK signaling pathway activity, is also involved. The mutations in the NF1 gene are identified in neurofibromatosis type I - a genodermatosis with higher risk of cancer development and tumor formation. Herein, a review of selected genodermatoses in the context of their molecular pathology is presented.

Mendelian susceptibility to mycobacterial disease (MSMD) is a rare syndrome conferring predisposition to clinical disease caused by weakly virulent mycobacteria, such as Mycobacterium bovis Bacille Calmette Guérin (BCG) vaccines and nontuberculous, environmental mycobacteria (EM). Since 1996, MSMD-causing mutations have been found in six autosomal genes involved in IL-12/23-dependent, IFN-γ-mediated immunity. The aim of this review is to provide the description of the two described forms of X-linked recessive (XR) MSMD. Germline mutations in two genes, NEMO and CYBB, have long been known to cause other human diseases-incontinentia pigmenti (IP) and anhidrotic ectodermal dysplasia with immunodeficiency (EDA-ID) (NEMO/IKKG), and X-linked chronic granulomatous disease (CGD) (CYBB)-but specific mutations in either of these two genes have recently been shown to cause XR-MSMD. NEMO is an essential component of several NF-κB-dependent signaling pathways. The MSMD-causing mutations in NEMO selectively affect the CD40-dependent induction of IL-12 in mononuclear cells. CYBB encodes gp91(phox) , which is an essential component of the NADPH oxidase in phagocytes. The MSMD-causing mutation in CYBB selectively affects the respiratory burst in macrophages. Mutations in NEMO and CYBB may therefore cause MSMD by selectively exerting their deleterious impact on a single signaling pathway (CD40-IL-12, NEMO) or a single cell type (macrophages, CYBB). These experiments of Nature illustrate how specific germline mutations in pleiotropic genes can dissociate signaling pathways or cell lineages, thereby resulting in surprisingly narrow clinical phenotypes.

Incontinentia pigmenti is a rare, X-linked, dominant genodermatosis affecting skin, teeth, eyes, and central nervous system. Symptoms are associated with mutations in the nuclear factor-kappa B essential modulator (NEMO) gene on chromosome Xq28. Here, a subpopulation of Chinese patients with incontinentia pigmenti were examined to investigate the frequency and pattern of NEMO mutations, and to analyze their clinical features. From January 1996 to August 2006, 52 participants (21 probands and 31 family members) were screened for symptoms of incontinentia pigmenti and NEMO gene mutations. We designed a NEMO-specific PCR primer, referred to as In2S, to detect a deletion of exon 4-10 of the NEMO gene, which represents the mutation most frequently associated with incontinentia pigmenti. For participants without this deletion, all exons were sequenced to screen for other NEMO mutations. In addition, the clinical manifestations and family histories of the participants were analyzed. Exon 4-10 was deleted in 13 probands, and one proband had a novel point mutation (G549C) in exon 5 that converted a glutamine to a histidine. Seven probands (33%) had no mutation in any of the exons of the NEMO gene. One of four participants who presented with hyperpigmentation also had the exon 4-10 deletion. One patient had a positive family history before the study took place, but no NEMO mutation was identified in any of the family members. Remarkably, the mothers of three of the probands exhibited the exon 4-10 deletion; however, their clinical manifestations were subtle and unrecognizable. Mutational analysis of the NEMO gene was helpful in diagnosing incontinentia pigmenti among participants with a nearly normal phenotype or an incomplete form of the disease that only caused hyperpigmentation symptoms.

Genetic conditions are increasingly recognised as a cause of multisystem diseases in children. We report a 6-year-old boy with hypohidrotic ectodermal dysplasia, immunodeficiency, osteopetrosis and lymphoedema, associated with a novel mutation in the NF-κβ essential modulator (NEMO) gene. He is the longest surviving of three reported boys with these clinical features. Hypohidrotic ectodermal dysplasia, a congenital disorder of teeth, hair and eccrine sweat glands is most commonly inherited as an X-linked recessive trait. Associated immunodeficiency (HED-ID) may give rise to serious infections in early life. Mutations in the NEMO gene give rise to a heterogeneous group of disorders, including the X-linked dominant disorder incontinentia pigmenti. This is characterised by typical skin changes leading to linear pigmentary change and variable associated features; in males, prenatal death usually occurs. Our patient, like one if the previous cases and all of their mothers, demonstrates features of incontinentia pigmenti.

Osteopetrosis, lymphedema, hypohidrotic ectodermal dysplasia, and immunodeficiency (OL-HED-ID) is a rare X-linked disorder with only three reported prior cases in the English-language literature. We describe a case of OL-HED-ID in a male infant who initially presented with congenital lymphedema, leukocytosis, and thrombocytopenia of unknown etiology at 7 days of age. He subsequently developed gram-negative sepsis and multiple opportunistic infections including high-level cytomegalovirus viremia and Pneumocystis jiroveci pneumonia. The infant was noted to have mildly xerotic skin, fine sparse hair, and periorbital wrinkling, all features suggestive of ectodermal dysplasia. Skeletal imaging showed findings consistent with osteopetrosis, and immunologic investigation revealed hypogammaglobulinemia and mixed T- and B-cell dysfunction. Genetic testing revealed a novel mutation in the nuclear factor kappa beta (NF-KB) essential modulator (NEMO) gene, confirming the diagnosis of OL-HED-ID. Mutations in the NEMO gene have been reported in association with hypohidrotic ectodermal dysplasia with immunodeficiency (HED-ID), OL-HED-ID, and incontinentia pigmenti. In this case, we report a novel mutation in the NEMO gene associated with OL-HED-ID. This article highlights the dermatologic manifestations of a rare disorder, OL-HED-ID, and underscores the importance of early recognition and prompt intervention to prevent life-threatening infections.

Incontinentia pigmenti (IP) is a rare inherited multisystem disorder characterized by a distinctive swirling pattern of the skin; defects of teeth, hair, and nails; and ophthalmic, central nervous system, and musculoskeletal abnormalities. It progresses through several well-defined stages. IP is transmitted as a dominant X-linked trait with variable expressivity, but many--if not most--cases are sporadic. IP has been shown to result from mutations in the NEMO gene that completely abolish expression of NF-kappaB essential modulator. The diagnosis of IP typically is made based on characteristic clinical findings. Molecular analysis of the NEMO gene is now possible, as is analysis of skewed X-chromosome inactivation, which can further reduce diagnostic confusion. A number of disorders, including hypomelanosis of Ito, should be considered in the differential diagnosis. The considerations vary according to the stage of IP. Careful head-to-toe clinical evaluation is critical in the evaluation of a child with suspected IP given the frequent multisystem involvement. A multidisciplinary approach including dermatology, ophthalmology, neurology, and dental consults is typically warranted. The skin manifestations of IP do not require specific treatment other than reassurance; spontaneous resolution of the lesions usually occurs.

Incontinentia pigmenti (IP) is a rare X-linked dominant disorder that affects ectodermal tissues. In IP, mutations in NEMO lead to the complete loss of NF-kB activation creating a susceptibility to cellular apoptosis in response to TNF-alpha. Recently, a second nonfunctional copy of the gene, Delta NEMO was identified, opposite in direction to NEMO. Almost 90% of IP whose gene mutation type had been recognized have a recurrent genomic deletion of exons 4-10 of the NEMO (IKK gamma) gene, called NEMO Delta 4-10, which is necessary to activate the NF-kB pathway. Therefore, PCR-based detection of the NEMO deletion is a diagnostic measurement for IP. This study sought to analyze the NEMO Delta 4-10 deletion in NEMO gene of Chinese IP cases. Seven IP cases and part of their families totally 15 persons were enrolled in this study. The 7 IP cases were aged 41 days to 8 years. Among them 1 was male and 6 were female. Four cases had family history of IP, the other 3 were sporadic cases. Fifty healthy children without any congenital diseases were taken as normal control group. According to the gene characteristics of IP, by PCR measurement NEMO Delta 4-10 deletion in NEMO gene was tested with specific primers In2/JF3R, and NEMO Delta 4-10 deletion in pseudogene Delta NEMO was checked out by primers Rev-2/JF3R. Five out of the 7 tested cases (case 1, 2, 3, 4, and 6) showed NEMO Delta 4-10 deletion in NEMO gene. The mothers of case 1 and case 6, 1a and 6a, also suffered from this disease, and their results were just the same as their daughters. For pseudogene Delta NEMO only case 2 and case 4 were proved having NEMO Delta 4-10 deletion, while other cases and families had negative results. For normal control group, NEMO Delta 4-10 deletion was not found either in NEMO gene or in their pseudogene Delta NEMO. Incontinentia pigmenti in most cases were caused by NEMO Delta 4-10 deletion in NEMO gene.

IKBKG/NEMO gene mutations cause an X-linked, dominant neuroectodermal disorder named Incontinentia Pigmenti (IP). Located at Xq28, IKBKG/NEMO has a unique genomic organization, as it is part of a segmental duplication or low copy repeat (LCR1-LCR2, >99% identical) containing the gene and its pseudogene copy (IKBKGP). In the opposite direction and outside LCR1, IKBKG/NEMO partially overlaps G6PD, whose mutations cause a common X-linked human enzymopathy. The two LCRs in the IKBKG/NEMO locus are able to recombine through non-allelic homologous recombination producing either a pathological recurrent exon 4-10 IKBKG/NEMO deletion (IKBKGdel) or benign small copy number variations. We here report that the local high frequency of micro/macro-homologies, tandem repeats and repeat/repetitive sequences make the IKBKG/NEMO locus susceptible to novel pathological IP alterations. Indeed, we describe the first two independent instances of inter-locus gene conversion, occurring between the two LCRs, that copies the IKBKGP pseudogene variants into the functional IKBKG/NEMO, causing the de novo occurrence of p.Glu390ArgfsX61 and the IKBKGdel mutations, respectively. Subsequently, by investigating a group of 20 molecularly unsolved IP subjects using a high-density quantitative polymerase chain reaction assay, we have identified seven unique de novo deletions varying from 4.8 to ∼115 kb in length. Each deletion removes partially or completely both IKBKG/NEMO and the overlapping G6PD, thereby uncovering the first deletions disrupting the G6PD gene which were found in patients with IP. Interestingly, the 4.8 kb deletion removes the conserved bidirectional promoterB, shared by the two overlapping IKBKG/NEMO and G6PD genes, leaving intact the alternative IKBKG/NEMO unidirectional promoterA. This promoter, although active in the keratinocytes of the basal dermal layer, is down-regulated during late differentiation. Genomic analysis at the breakpoint sites indicated that other mutational forces, such as non-homologous end joining, Alu-Alu-mediated recombination and replication-based events, might enhance the vulnerability of the IP locus to produce de novo pathological IP alleles.

Incontinentia pigmenti (IP; MIM308310) is a rare neurocutaneous X-dominant inherited disorder. Besides skin and neurological abnormalities, there is also ophthalmologic and dental involvement. The first stage is characterised by inflammation and apoptosis of the skin and central nervous system. The first stage consists of vesicles and the second of verrucous elements; the third stage is characterised by hyperpigmentation while the fourth is characterised by slightly atrophic hypopigmentations. The skin abnormalities follow the lines of Blaschko. The disorder is observed almost exclusively in girls, but diseased boys are more seriously affected. The IP gene is localised on chromosome Xq28. Mutations in the NEMO-gene are responsible for IP. This gene codes for the nuclear factor-KB essential modulator protein (NEMO; synonym: inhibitor kappaB kinase (IKK)y). In the absence of serious neurological symptoms, the prognosis is not poor.

Incontinentia pigmenti (IP) is an X-linked-dominant Mendelian disorder caused by mutation in the IKBKG/NEMO gene, encoding for NEMO/IKKgamma, a regulatory protein of nuclear factor kappaB (NF-kB) signaling. In more than 80% of cases, IP is due to recurrent or nonrecurrent deletions causing loss-of-function (LoF) of NEMO/IKKgamma. We review how the local architecture of the IKBKG/NEMO locus with segmental duplication and a high frequency of repetitive elements favor de novo aberrant recombination through different mechanisms producing genomic microdeletion. We report here a new microindel (c.436_471delinsT, p.Val146X) arising through a DNA-replication-repair fork-stalling-and-template-switching and microhomology-mediated-end-joining mechanism in a sporadic IP case. The LoF mutations of IKBKG/NEMO leading to IP include small insertions/deletions (indel) causing frameshift and premature stop codons, which account for 10% of cases. We here present 21 point mutations previously unreported, which further extend the spectrum of pathologic variants: 14/21 predict LoF because of premature stop codon (6/14) or frameshift (8/14), whereas 7/21 predict a partial loss of NEMO/IKKgamma activity (two splicing and five missense). We review how the analysis of IP-associated IKBKG/NEMO hypomorphic mutants has contributed to the understanding of the pathophysiological mechanism of IP disease and has provided important information on affected NF-kB signaling. We built a locus-specific database listing all IKBKG/NEMO variants, accessible at http://IKBKG.lovd.nl.

Disruption of the X-linked gene encoding NF-kappa B essential modulator (NEMO) produces male embryonic lethality, completely blocks NF-kappa B activation by proinflammatory cytokines, and interferes with the generation and/or persistence of lymphocytes. Heterozygous female mice develop patchy skin lesions with massive granulocyte infiltration and hyperproliferation and increased apoptosis of keratinocytes. Diseased animals present severe growth retardation and early mortality. Surviving mice recover almost completely, presumably through clearing the skin of NEMO-deficient keratinocytes. Male lethality and strikingly similar skin lesions in heterozygous females are hallmarks of the human genetic disorder incontinentia pigmenti (IP). Together with the recent discovery that mutations in the human NEMO gene cause IP, our results indicate that we have created a mouse model for that disease.
