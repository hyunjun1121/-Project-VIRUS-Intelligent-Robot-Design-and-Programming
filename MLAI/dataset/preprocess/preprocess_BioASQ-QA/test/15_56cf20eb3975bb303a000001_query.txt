Activation of large conductance Ca(2+)-activated potassium (BK) channels hastens action potential repolarisation and generates the fast afterhyperpolarisation in hippocampal pyramidal neurons. A rapid coupling of Ca(2+) entry with BK channel activation is necessary for this to occur, which might result from an identified coupling of Ca(2+) entry through N-type Ca(2+) channels to BK channel activation. This selective coupling was extremely rapid and resistant to intracellular BAPTA, suggesting that the two channel types are close. Using reciprocal co-immunoprecipitation, we found that N-type channels were more abundantly associated with BK channels than L-type channels (Ca(V)1.2) in rat brain. Expression of only the pore-forming alpha-subunits of the N-type (Ca(V)2.2) and BK (Slo(27)) channels in a non-neuronal cell-line gave robust macroscopic currents and reproduced the interaction. Co-expression of Ca(V)2.2/Ca(V)beta(3) subunits with Slo(27) channels revealed rapid functional coupling. By contrast, extremely rare examples of rapid functional coupling were observed with co-expression of Ca(V)1.2/Ca(V)beta(3) and Slo(27) channels. Action potential repolarisation in hippocampal pyramidal neurons was slowed by the N-type channel blocker omega-conotoxin GVIA, but not by the L-type channel blocker isradipine. These data showed that selective functional coupling between N-type Ca(2+) and BK channels provided rapid activation of BK channels in central neurons.

This study examines the molecular basis for the T-type and L-type Ca(2+) currents in canine Purkinje cells. The I(CaT) in Purkinje cells was completely suppressed by 200 nM kurtoxin, a specific blocker of both Ca(v)3.1 and Ca(v)3.2 channels. Since only Ca(v)3.2 mRNA is expressed at high levels in Purkinje fibres, being approximately 100-fold more abundant than either Ca(v)3.1 or Ca(v)3.3 mRNAs, it is concluded that the Ca(v)3.2 gene encodes the bulk of the T-type Ca(2+) channels in canine Purkinje cells. This conclusion is consistent with the sensitivity of the current to blockade by Ni(2+) ions (K(D) = 32 microM). For L-type channels, Ca(v)1.2 mRNA was most abundant in Purkinje fibres but a significant level of Ca(v)1.3 mRNA expression was also found. A comparison of the sensitivity to blockade by isradipine of the L-type currents in Purkinje cells and ventricular epicardial myocytes, which only express Ca(v)1.2, suggests that the Ca(v)1.3 channels make, at most, a minor contribution to the L-type current in canine Purkinje cells.

There is strong evidence that intracellular calcium dysregulation plays an important pathological role in Alzheimer's disease, and specifically that beta amyloid may induce increases in intracellular calcium and lead to neuronal cell dysfunction and death. Here we investigated the feasibility of modifying Alzheimer's pathology with the L-type voltage-gated calcium channel blockers verapamil, diltiazem, isradipine and nimodipine. All four compounds protected MC65 neuroblastoma cells from amyloid beta protein precursor C-terminal fragment (APP CTF)-induced neurotoxicity. Isradipine was the most potent blocker, preventing APP CTF neurotoxicity at nanomolar concentrations. Intracellular beta amyloid expression was associated with increased expression of Cav 1.2 calcium channels and increased intracellular calcium influx from the extracellular space. Despite the cytoprotection afforded by calcium channel blockers, amyloid beta oligomer formation was not suppressed. The mechanism of cell death in MC65 cells is appeared to be caspase-3 independent. With the goal of determining if there is sufficient experimental support to move forward with animal trials of isradipine, we determined its bioavailability in the triple transgenic mouse model of AD. Subcutaneous implantation of carrier-bound isradipine (3 Î¼g/g/day) for 60 days resulted in nanomolar concentrations in both the plasma and brain. Taken together, our in vitro results support the theory that calcium blockers exert protective effects downstream of the effects of beta amyloid. Isradipine's neuroprotective effect at concentrations that are clinically relevant and achievable in vitro and in vivo suggests that this particular calcium blocking agent may have therapeutic value in the treatment of Alzheimer's disease.

In cochlea inner hair cells (IHCs), L-type Ca(2+) channels (LTCCs) formed by alpha1D subunits (D-LTCCs) possess biophysical and pharmacological properties distinct from those of alpha1C containing C-LTCCs. We investigated to which extent these differences are determined by alpha1D itself by analyzing the biophysical and pharmacological properties of cloned human alpha1D splice variants in tsA-201 cells. Variant alpha1D(8A,) containing exon 8A sequence in repeat I, yielded alpha1D protein and L-type currents, whereas no intact protein and currents were observed after expression with exon 8B. In whole cell patch-clamp recordings (charge carrier 15-20 mm Ba(2+)), alpha1D(8A) - mediated currents activated at more negative voltages (activation threshold, -45.7 versus -31.5 mV, p < 0.05) and more rapidly (tau(act) for maximal inward currents 0.8 versus 2.3 ms; p < 0.05) than currents mediated by rabbit alpha1C. Inactivation during depolarizing pulses was slower than for alpha1C (current inactivation after 5-s depolarizations by 90 versus 99%, p < 0.05) but faster than for LTCCs in IHCs. The sensitivity for the dihydropyridine (DHP) L-type channel blocker isradipine was 8.5-fold lower than for alpha1C. Radioligand binding experiments revealed that this was not due to a lower affinity for the DHP binding pocket, suggesting that differences in the voltage-dependence of DHP block account for decreased sensitivity of D-LTCCs. Our experiments show that alpha1D(8A) subunits can form slowly inactivating LTCCs activating at more negative voltages than alpha1C. These properties should allow D-LTCCs to control physiological processes, such as diastolic depolarization in sinoatrial node cells, neurotransmitter release in IHCs and neuronal excitability.

The motor symptoms of Parkinson's disease (PD) are due to the progressive loss of dopamine (DA) neurons in substantia nigra pars compacta (SNc). Nothing is known to slow the progression of the disease, making the identification of potential neuroprotective agents of great clinical importance. Previous studies using the 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine (MPTP) model of PD have shown that antagonism of L-type Ca2+ channels protects SNc DA neurons. However, this was not true in a 6-hydroxydopamine (6-OHDA) model. One potential explanation for this discrepancy is that protection in the 6-OHDA model requires greater antagonism of Cav1.3 L-type Ca2+ channels thought to underlie vulnerability and this was not achievable with the low affinity dihydropyridine (DHP) antagonist used. To test this hypothesis, the DHP with the highest affinity for Cav1.3L-type channels-isradipine-was systemically administered and then the DA toxin 6-OHDA injected intrastriatally. Twenty-five days later, neuroprotection and plasma concentration of isradipine were determined. This analysis revealed that isradipine produced a dose-dependent sparing of DA fibers and cell bodies at concentrations achievable in humans, suggesting that isradipine is a potentially viable neuroprotective agent for PD.

Following chronic liver injury, hepatic stellate cells (HSCs) transdifferentiate into myofibroblast-like cells, which develop contractile properties and contribute to increased resistance to blood flow. We investigated whether this phenotypic activation includes changes in the expression of L-type voltage-operated Ca2+ channels (VOCC), which mediate Ca2+ influx and regulate cell contraction in vascular cell types. Rat HSCs were studied in the quiescent phenotype and after their activation in vitro (cultured on plastic for 14 days) and in vivo (isolated from rats with CCl(4)-induced cirrhosis). Patch-clamp studies showed Ca2+ currents through L-type VOCC in HSCs activated both in vitro and in vivo, whereas no currents were detected in quiescent HSCs. Moreover, binding studies with (3)H-isradipine, a specific L-type VOCC antagonist, showed a large number of binding sites in activated HSCs, while no specific binding was found in quiescent HSCs. Finally, messenger RNA (mRNA) encoding L-type VOCC was not detected in quiescent HSCs as assessed by reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) and Northern blot analysis, whereas it was present in activated HSCs. Stimulation of L-type VOCC with KCl resulted in a marked increase in [Ca2+](i) followed by cell contraction in HSCs activated both in vitro and in vivo, whereas no effects were observed in quiescent HSCs. We conclude that the activation of HSCs is associated with up-regulation of L-type VOCC that mediate Ca2+ influx and cell contraction. These results may be relevant to the pathogenesis of portal hypertension.

We have previously demonstrated that L-type Ca(2+) channels are involved in post-tetanic potentiation (PTP) of GABAergic IPSCs in cultured hippocampal neurons. Here we have used intracellular Fluo-3 to detect [Ca(2+)](i) in single GABAergic boutons in response to stimulation that evokes PTP. During control stimulation of the presynaptic GABAergic neuron at 40 Hz for 1-2 s, DeltaF/F(0) increased rapidly to a peak value and started to decline shortly after the train ended, returning to baseline within 10-20 s. The L-type channel blocker, isradipine (5 microM), had no significant effect on the amplitude or kinetics of the Ca(2+) signal. Following blockade of N- and P/Q-type Ca(2+)-channels, the amplitude was reduced by 52.9+/-3%. Isradipine caused a reduction of the remaining response (by 26.6+/-5%, P<0.01), that was fully reversible on washing. The L-type channel "agonist", BayK 8644 (8 microM), caused a significant enhancement of the peak (by 18.7%+/-7%, P<0.05). The rising phase of the Ca(2+) signal, which is related to the rate of entry of Ca(2+) into the bouton, was decreased by isradipine (by 25.5+/-6%, P<0.05) and enhanced by BayK 8644 (by 45.2%+/-16%, P<0.05). These Ca(2+) imaging experiments support the putative role of L-type channels in PTP of GABAergic synapses on cultured hippocampal neurons. We expect L-channels to be few in number, although they may couple strongly to intracellular signalling cascades that could amplify a signal that regulates synaptic vesicle turnover in the GABAergic boutons.

Permanent or transient focal cerebral ischemia was induced in spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHR) using the intraluminal filament method. Successful occlusion of the middle cerebral artery (MCA) was achieved using 4/O filaments (terminal diameter 0.20-0.25 mm) coated with poly-L-lysine. The L-type calcium channel blocker isradipine (2.5 mg/kg) administered subcutaneously 30 min following permanent MCA occlusion significantly reduced the volume of ischemic brain damage in the cerebral hemisphere (25%; P = 0.0001), cerebral cortex (18%; P = 0.0034), and caudate nucleus (33%; P = 0.0002) when assessed at 24 h post-MCA occlusion. Isradipine did not affect the functional deficit (measured using a subjective neurological scoring system) induced by MCA occlusion. In SHR undergoing transient (2 h) MCA occlusion isradipine administered 30 min post-MCA occlusion produced a significant reduction (47%; P = 0.001) in hemispheric infarct volume, whereas isradipine administered at the onset of reperfusion did not confer any significant neuroprotection. No change in functional deficit was seen with isradipine with either dosing paradigm at 24 h post-MCA occlusion. These results demonstrate that the intraluminal filament method of MCA occlusion can be used in the SHR strain and also substantiates the neuroprotective efficacy of isradipine in SHR models of permanent and transient focal cerebral ischemia.

Hypobaric hypoxia leads to cognitive dysfunctions due to increase in intracellular calcium through ion channels. The purpose of this study was to examine the temporal contribution of L-type calcium channels and N-methyl-D-aspartate receptors (NMDARs) in mediating neuronal death in male Sprague Dawley rats exposed to hypobaric hypoxia simulating an altitude of 25,000 ft for different durations. Decreasing exogenous calcium loads by blocking voltage-gated calcium influx with isradipine (2.5 mg kg(-1)), and its efficacy in providing neuroprotection and preventing memory impairment following hypoxic exposure was also investigated. Effect of isradipine on calcium-dependent enzymes mediating oxidative stress and apoptotic cell death was also studied. Blocking of L-type calcium channels with isradipine reduced hypoxia-induced activation of calcium dependent xanthine oxidases, monoamine oxidases, cytosolic phospholipase A(2) and cycloxygenases (COX-2) along with concomitant decrease in free radical generation and cytochrome c release. Increased expression of calpain and caspase 3 was also observed following exposure to hypobaric hypoxia along with augmented neurodegeneration and memory impairment which was adequately prevented by isradipine administration. Administration of isradipine during hypoxic exposure protected the hippocampal neurons following 3 and 7 days of exposure to hypobaric hypoxia along with improvement in spatial memory.

Previous studies have shown that 17 beta-estradiol (beta-E2) has a direct acute inhibitory effect on vascular smooth muscle (VSM) contraction. To investigate the mechanisms underlying this phenomenon, we utilized whole cell patch-clamping techniques to study effects of beta-E2 on voltage-dependent Ca2+ channels in cultured VSM cells (VSMC). T- and L-type Ca2+ currents were characterized with ramp and pulse protocols in A7r5 cultured VSMC. T-type current, inactivated in < 100 ms, was reduced by Ba2+ and was comparatively little affected by isradipine. L-type current required higher voltages to activate, inactivated slowly, was greatly increased by Ba2+, and could be completely inhibited by 5 microM isradipine. beta-E2 (10 microM) significantly reduced peak L-type Ba2+ current and T-type Ca2+ current within 1-2 min, whereas alpha E2 (a hormonally inactive isomer of estradiol) caused significantly less reduction in both types of current. Vehicle (0.1% ethanol) had no significant effect on either current. The inhibitory effect of beta-E2 on voltage-dependent Ca2+ currents may contribute to previously demonstrated beta-E2 attenuation of VSM contraction.

Parkinson's disease is a common neurodegenerative disorder of unknown cause. There is no cure or proven strategy for slowing the progression of the disease. Although there are signs of pathology in many brain regions, the core symptoms of Parkinson's disease are attributable to the selective degeneration of dopaminergic neurons in the substantia nigra pars compacta. A potential clue to the vulnerability of these neurons is their increasing reliance on Ca(2+) channels to maintain autonomous activity with age. This reliance could pose a sustained metabolic stress on mitochondria, accelerating cellular ageing and death. The Ca(2+) channels underlying autonomous activity in dopaminergic neurons are closely related to the L-type channels found in the heart and smooth muscle. Systemic administration of isradipine, a dihydropyridine blocker of L-type channels, forces dopaminergic neurons in rodents to revert to a juvenile, Ca(2+)-independent mechanism to generate autonomous activity. More importantly, reversion confers protection against toxins that produce experimental parkinsonism, pointing to a potential neuroprotective strategy for Parkinson's disease with a drug class that has been used safely in human beings for decades. These studies also suggest that, although genetic and environmental factors can hasten its onset, Parkinson's disease stems from a distinctive neuronal design common to all human beings, making its appearance simply a matter of time.

Halothane has been previously shown in vitro to decrease both the inward calcium current in isolated cells and the density of calcium antagonist binding sites in cardiac sarcolemmal membranes prepared from several species, including humans, presumably contributing to the negative inotropic effects seen with volatile anesthetics. In this study we examined whether halothane produced similar changes in calcium channel antagonist binding characteristics ex vivo in an intact perfused heart by using isradipine, a dihydropyridine calcium channel blocker that binds specifically to the alpha 1 subunit of the L-type voltage-dependent calcium channel. The rat hearts were perfused by the Langendorff method in the presence of halothane and unlabeled isradipine. After the hearts were homogenized and prepared into membranes, a radioligand binding assay was performed and binding curves obtained. Data were analyzed by nonlinear regression analysis of a one-site binding equation and were evaluated by a paired t test. Halothane protected or inhibited the binding of unlabeled isradipine to calcium channels in a dose-dependent manner such that as the halothane is removed during the membrane preparation process, previously obscured sites were then available for specific binding of the radioligand. The sites that were protected by halothane had a lower affinity for [3H]-isradipine than controls. In both isolated membranes and the intact heart, halothane changes the availability of calcium channel antagonist binding sites, indicating a change in conformation of the voltage-dependent calcium channel in the presence of anesthetic. This change may result from a direct effect on the protein or from an indirect effect mediated through the membrane lipid bilayer. It also is demonstrated that halothane "protected" channels are probably a modified class of channels compared to those in control tissues as exemplified by the much lower affinity that the protected channels have for [3H]-isradipine. We conclude that a major mechanism by which halothane depresses contractility is mediated through the voltage-dependent calcium channel, and this process results from a conformational change in the channel.

Invertebrate L-type calcium channel, LCa(v) 1, isolated from the pond snail Lymnaea stagnalis is nearly indistinguishable from mammalian Ca(v) 1.2 (Î±1C) calcium channel in biophysical characteristics observed in vitro. These L-type channels are likely constrained within a narrow range of biophysical parameters to perform similar functions in the snail and mammalian cardiovascular systems. What distinguishes snail and mammalian L-type channels is a difference in dihydropyridine sensitivity: 100 nM isradipine exhibits a significant block of mammalian Ca(v) 1.2 currents without effect on snail LCa(v)1 currents. The native snail channel serves as a valuable surrogate for validating key residue differences identified from previous experimental and molecular modeling work. As predicted, three residue changes in LCa(v)1 (N_3o18, F_3i10, and I_4i12) replaced with DHP-sensing residues in respective positions of Ca(v) 1.2, (Q_3o18, Y_3i10, and M_4i12) raises the potency of isradipine block of LCa(v)1 channels to that of mammalian Ca(v) 1.2. Interestingly, the single N_3o18_Q mutation in LCa(v) 1 channels lowers DHP sensitivity even further and the triple mutation bearing enhanced isradipine sensitivity, still retains a reduced potency of agonist, (S)-Bay K8644.

Alzheimer's disease is the most devastating neurodegenerative disorder in the elderly, yet treatment options are severely limited. The drug development effort to modify Alzheimer's disease pathology by intervention at beta amyloid production sites has been largely ineffective or inconclusive. The greatest challenge has been to identify and define downstream mechanisms reliably predictive of clinical symptoms. Beta amyloid accumulation leads to dysregulation of intracellular calcium by plasma membrane L-type calcium channels located on neuronal somatodendrites and axons in the hippocampus and cortex. Paradoxically, L-type calcium channel subtype Ca(v)1.2 also promotes synaptic plasticity and spatial memory. Increased intracellular calcium modulates amyloid precursor protein processing and affects multiple downstream pathways including increased hyperphosphorylated tau and suppression of autophagy. Isradipine is a Federal Drug Administration-approved dihydropyridine calcium channel blocker that binds selectively to Ca(v)1.2 in the hippocampus. Our studies have shown that isradipine in vitro attenuates beta amyloid oligomer toxicity by suppressing calcium influx into cytoplasm and by suppressing Ca(v)1.2 expression. We have previously shown that administration of isradipine to triple transgenic animal model for Alzheimer's disease was well-tolerated. Our results further suggest that isradipine became bioavailable, lowered tau burden, and improved autophagy function in the brain. A better understanding of brain pharmacokinetics of calcium channel blockers will be critical for designing new experiments with appropriate drug doses in any future clinical trials for Alzheimer's disease. This review highlights the importance of Ca(v)1.2 channel overexpression, the accumulation of hyperphosphorylated tau and suppression of autophagy in Alzheimer's disease and modulation of this pathway by isradipine.

We have demonstrated that both high-K+ and electrical stimulation of the vagus nerves release endogenous glutamate from the vascularly-perfused rat stomach in a calcium-dependent manner. In the present study, we examined properties of calcium channel subtypes mediating endogenous glutamate release from the stomach. Application of 50 mM KCl elicited a release of glutamate, and this release was abolished in calcium-free medium. The release of glutamate was significantly inhibited by both omega-agatoxin IVA, a P/Q-type calcium channel antagonist, and isradipine, an L type calcium channel antagonist. Omega-conotoxin GVIA, an N type calcium channel antagonist and flunarizine, a nonselective T-type calcium channel antagonist were without effect. In contrast to this case of glutamate, omega-conotoxin GVIA induced a marked inhibition in the release of gastric noradrenaline. The combined treatment with omega-agatoxin IVA plus isradipine produced a marked synergistic inhibition of the glutamate release. This inhibition was, however, much less than that by cadmium. The present results suggest that P/Q and L type calcium channels coexist to regulate the release of gastric glutamate. Furthermore, it is possible that unidentified calcium channels other than P/Q and L type channels are also involved in the release of glutamate in the stomach.
