What is the frequency of mutations induced spontaneously through Ethylnitrosourea (ENU) mutagenesis?

[PMID: 18504270]
A perceived disadvantage of transgenic rodent mutation assays is that spontaneous mutant frequencies are high compared to those of endogenous genes and may consequently reduce sensitivity to induced mutation. We have previously argued that unrepaired G:T mismatches from spontaneous deamination of 5-methylcytosine at CpG sites could be converted to apparent in vivo mutations in the bacterial recovery systems because of rapid, random, mismatch repair in Escherichia coli. In this study, we have measured mutation frequencies in spleen of male mice induced by N-ethyl-N-nitrosourea (ENU) using the PhiX174 transgene, which is not subject to mismatch repair in E.coli, using single-burst analysis, a unique method to identify in vivo mutation. In order to compare our results to those using the lacI and cII transgenes, we converted all mutant frequencies to base pair substitution (bps) mutation frequencies per nucleotide based on mutant spectra from this study and published literature. We found this frequency in control spleen to be similar for lacI (3.8 +/- 0.7 x 10(-8)) and PhiX174 (3.1 +/- 1.2 x 10(-8)) at 6 weeks of age. We found a strong age dependence for spontaneous lacI mutation that extrapolated to a value at conception (1.8 +/- 0.9 x 10(-8)) that was not significantly different from the human germ line bps mutation frequency per nucleotide of 1.7 +/- 0.2 x 10(-8). These two transgenes provided similar mutational responses to 40 mg/kg ENU, 7- to 9-fold. In contrast, the cII target gene in the same tissue produces both spontaneous and induced mutation frequencies approximately 10 times higher, for unknown reasons. We conclude that the spontaneous mutant frequencies measured by the lacI and PhiX174 transgenes in this moderately dividing tissue accurately measure in vivo mutation frequencies at early ages. For these two transgenes, seemingly high mutant frequencies may reflect the expected accumulation of somatic mutation with age.

To explore the molecular spectra and mechanism of human hypoxanthine guanine phosphoribosyl transferase (HPRT) gene mutation induced by ethyluitrosourea (ENU). Single cell cloning culture, two-way screening, multiple PCR amplification and electrophoresis technique were used. With dose of ENU increasing, cell plating efficiency reduced (in the group with 100-200 micro g/ml doses, P < 0.01) and mutation frequency increased (in the group with 12.5-200.0 micro g/ml doses, P < 0.05) significantly. There was no all exons deletion in spontaneous mutations, and only 7.7% of them were detected as single exon deletion. But, deletion was found in 79.7% of ENU-induced mutations (62.5%-89.4%, P < 0.01), and deletion mutations in all nine exons of HPRT gene. Most of ENU-induced mutations were chain deletion with multiple exons (88.1%). The spectra in spontaneous mutations differed completely from ENU-induced ones. ENU was liable to cause bigger changes in genetic structure, which suggested a stronger ENU's mutagenesis.

Bloom Syndrome (BS) is characterized by both cancer and genomic instability, including chromosomal aberrations, sister chromosome exchanges, and mutations. Since BS heterozygotes are much more frequent than homozygotes, the issue of the sensitivity of heterozygotes to cancer is an important one. This and many other questions concerning the effects of BLM (the gene responsible for the BS) are more easily studied in mice than in humans. To gain insight into genomic instability associated with loss of function of BLM, which codes for a DNA helicase, we compared frequencies of micronuclei, somatic mutations, and loss of heterozygosity (LOH) in Blmtm3Brd homozygous, heterozygous, and wild-type mice carrying a cII transgenic reporter gene. It should be noted that the Blmtm3Brd is inserted into the endogenous locus with a partial duplication of the gene, so some function of the locus may be retained. The cII reporter gene was introduced from the Big Blue mouse by crossing them with Blmtm3Brd mice. All measurements were made on F2 mice from this cross. The reticulocytes of Blmtm3Brd homozygous mice had more micronuclei than heterozygous or wild-type mice (4.5, 2.7, and 2.5 per thousand, respectively; P < 0.01) but heterozygotes did not differ significantly from wild-type. Unlike spontaneous chromosome damage, spontaneous mutant frequencies did not differ significantly among homozygous, heterozygous, and wild-type mice (3.2 x 10(-5), 3.1 x 10(-5), and 3.1 x 10(-5), respectively; P > 0.05). Mutation measurements were also made on mice that had been treated with ethyl-nitrosourea (ENU) because Bloom Syndrome cells are sensitive to ethylating agents. The ENU-induced mutation frequency in Blmtm3Brd homozygous, heterozygous, and wild mice were 54 x 10(-5), 35 x 10(-5), and 25 x 10(-5) mutants/plaques, respectively. ENU induced more mutations in Blmtm3Brd homozygous mice than in wild-type mice (P < 0.01), but not significantly more in heterozygous mice (P = 0.06). Spontaneous LOH did not differ significantly among the genotypes, but ENU treatment induced much more LOH in Blmtm3Brd homozygous mice, as measured by means of the Dlb-1 test of Vomiero-Highton and Heddle. Hence, these Blmtm3Brd mice resemble Bloom Syndrome except that they have normal frequencies of spontaneous mutation. The fact that these mice have elevated rates of both cancer and chromosomal aberrations (as shown by more micronuclei and LOH) but normal rates of spontaneous mutation, shows the greater importance of chromosomal events than mutations in the origin of their cancers.

In order to maximize the mutagenic effectiveness of N-ethyl-N-nitrosourea in mouse stem-cell spermatogonia, advantage was taken of the fact that these cells can accumulate mutations from repeated doses given over relatively long time periods. Repeated doses (100 mg/kg) of ethylnitrosourea injected intraperitoneally into male mice at weekly intervals were found to allow adequate survival and fertility with total dosages of 300 and 400 mg/kg. The specific-locus mutation frequencies at these dosages were, respectively, 1.8 and 2.2 times that obtained with the maximal practicable single dose of 250 mg/kg. The mutation frequency induced by a 400 mg/kg dosage of ethylnitrosourea is 12 times the maximal mutation frequency achievable with a single exposure to x-rays and 36 times that reported for procarbazine, the most effective chemical mutagen previously known for mouse stem-cell spermatogonia. Ethylnitrosourea is already the mutagen of choice in deliberate attempts to create mouse models for human disease and in any experiments in which a maximal mutation rate is desired. Repeated-dose regimens similar to the ones reported here should increase the efficiency of such studies.

The ability to generate mutations is a prerequisite to functional genetic analysis. Despite a long history of using mice as a model system for genetic analysis, the scientific community has not generated a comprehensive collection of multiple alleles for most mouse genes. The chemical mutagen of choice for mouse has been N-ethyl-N-nitrosourea (ENU), an alkylating agent that mainly causes base substitutions in DNA, and therefore allows for recovery of complete and partial loss-, as well as gain-, of-function alleles . Specific locus tests designed to detect recessive mutations showed that ENU is the most efficient mutagen in mouse with an approximate mutation rate of 1 in 1,000 gametes. In fact, several genome-wide and region-specific screens based on phenotypes have been carried out. The anticipation of the completion of the human and mouse genome projects, however, now emphasizes genotype-driven genetics--from sequence to mutants. To take advantage of the mutagenicity of ENU and its ability to create allelic series of mutations, we have developed a complementary approach to generating mutations using mouse embryonic stem (ES) cells. We show that a high mutation frequency can be achieved and that modulating DNA-repair activities can enhance this frequency. The treated cells retain germline competency, thereby rendering this approach applicable for efficient generation of an allelic series of mutations pivotal to a fine-tuned dissection of biological pathways.

Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells in culture were utilized to determine the cytotoxicity, specific-locus mutation induction, and DNA alkylation which result from treatment of the cells with a range of concentrations of N-methyl-N-nitrosourea (MNU) or N-ethyl-N-nitrosourea (ENU). With [3H]MNU over the concentration range 0.43--13.7 mM, methylation of DNA was found to increase linearly, with a mean value of 56.7 pmol residue per mumol nucleoside per mM. With [1-3H]ENU over the concentration range 1.7--26.8 mM, ethylation was linear, with a mean value of 3.8 pmol residue per mumol nucleotide per mM. Mutation induction at the hypoxanthine-guanine phosphoribosyl transferase (HGPRT) locus was quantified by determination of the frequency of resistance to 6-thioguanine under stringently-defined selection conditions. The mutation frequency increased linearly with MNU or ENU concentration (0.01--2.0 mM); mean values were 2800 and 840 mutants per 10(6) clonable cells per mM, respectively. At equal levels of DNA alkylation, ENU was found to be approx. 4.5 times as mutagenic as MNU.

Treating mice with ethylnitrosourea (ENU) is an efficient means for mutagenizing spermatogonial cells, and this treatment has been proven effective in a variety of screens for both dominant and recessive mutations. However, a significant problem for this technology is that the efficiency of mutagenesis is assessed most often by the empiric determination of a per-locus mutation frequency by using the specific locus test, which is expensive, time-consuming, and logistically difficult. To approach this question more directly and more efficiently, one can utilize methods of PCR-based mutation detection for the characterization of progeny of mutagenized mice. Since this analysis can be done after a single generation of breeding, it is useful as a rapid means for the assessment of the efficiency of mutagen treatment. Furthermore, it is readily imaginable that this strategy can be applied for the general determination of gene function in a systematic manner. Theoretical considerations and empirical analysis suggest that the per-base mutation frequency for a fractionated-dose treatment protocol is on the order of 1 sequence change per 10(5) bp.
