Which protein is mutated in Erythropoietic Protoporphyria?

[PMID: 29610169]
The porphyrias are a group of rare metabolic disorders that result from defects in heme biosynthesis. Erythropoietic protoporphyria (EPP) is the most common inherited porphyria in children and is diagnosed in most individuals after the onset of cutaneous manifestations. Hepatobiliary disease affects the minority of individuals with EPP and usually manifests in patients with an established diagnosis of EPP. We report on a classic but rare case of EPP that masqueraded as cholestasis. An 8-year-old boy was referred to the Hepatology Clinic after an abrupt onset of jaundice with a longstanding history of dermatitis. The diagnosis of EPP was established with liver biopsy, which revealed dense, dark-brown pigment in hepatocytes and Kupffer cells that, on polarization, displayed bright-red birefringence and centrally located Maltese crosses. Plasma total porphyrins and erythrocyte protoporphyrin were elevated and confirmed a diagnosis of EPP. We hope to raise awareness of this diagnosis among pediatricians, hepatologists, and pathologists and increase the consideration of EPP in patients with cholestatic liver disease and chronic dermatitis.

A 27-year-old man bearing an erythropoietic protoporphyria (EPP)-associated ferrochelatase (FECH) mutation was admitted to our hospital for general malaise and marked elevation of the serum levels of hepatobiliary enzymes and bilirubin. Initial treatment with plasma exchange did not reduce the blood protoporphyrin or serum liver enzyme levels, so phlebotomy was started. Surprisingly, weekly phlebotomy normalized the serum levels of liver enzymes, accompanied by a marked reduction in the blood protoporphyrin levels. The clinical course of this case strongly suggests that phlebotomy may be a suitable treatment option for EPP-related hepatopathy.

Erythropoietic protoporphyria (EPP) is a rare inherited disorder of the heme biosynthesis pathway resulting in the accumulation of protoporphyrins in the blood, erythrocytes, and other tissues. Because of a gene mutation in the FECH gene, ferrochelatase, the enzyme involved in the final step of heme synthesis, is deficient in these patients. Although the major symptom of this disorder is photosensitivity, rarely, it can cause progressive liver disease requiring liver transplantation (LT). However, LT is not curative and only bone marrow transplantation (BMT) can correct the underlying enzymatic defect. Because liver disease results from accumulation of protoporphyrin in the liver, LT without hematopoietic stem cell transplantation leaves the new liver at risk for similar EPP-related damage. A handful of pediatric patients undergoing sequential LT and stem cell transplantation have been described in the literature; however, to date none has been described in detail in adults. We report a case of an adult male with EPP and liver failure who successfully underwent a sequential liver and hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT).
