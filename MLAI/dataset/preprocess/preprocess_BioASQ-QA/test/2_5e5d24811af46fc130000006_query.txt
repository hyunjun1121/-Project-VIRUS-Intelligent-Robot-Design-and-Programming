What is romiplostim targeting?

[PMID: 29191945]
Congenital amegakaryocytic thrombocytopenia (CAMT) is an inherited disorder characterized at birth by thrombocytopenia with reduced megakaryocytes, which evolves into generalized bone marrow aplasia during childhood. Although CAMT is genetically heterogeneous, mutations of <i>MPL</i>, the gene encoding for the receptor of thrombopoietin (THPO), are the only known disease-causing alterations. We identified a family with three children affected with CAMT caused by a homozygous mutation (p.R119C) of the <i>THPO</i> gene. Functional studies showed that p.R119C affects not only ability of the cytokine to stimulate MPL but also its release, which is consistent with the relatively low serum THPO levels measured in patients. In all the three affected children, treatment with the THPO-mimetic romiplostim induced trilineage hematological responses, remission of bleeding and infections, and transfusion independence, which were maintained after up to 6.5Â years of observation. Recognizing patients with <i>THPO</i> mutations among those with juvenile bone marrow failure is essential to provide them with appropriate substitutive therapy and prevent the use of invasive and unnecessary treatments, such as hematopoietic stem cell transplantation or immunosuppression.

Thrombocytopenia is frequent among sick neonates. While most cases are transient, some neonates experience prolonged and severe thrombocytopenia. These infants often pose diagnostic and therapeutic challenges, and may receive large numbers of platelet transfusions. Romiplostim (ROM) is a thrombopoietin (TPO)-receptor-agonist approved for treatment of adults with chronic immune thrombocytopenia (ITP). The immature platelet fraction (IPF) is a novel measure of newly produced platelets, which could aid with the diagnostic evaluation of thrombocytopenic neonates. This study had the following two objectives: (1) compare the response of newborn and adult mice to escalating doses of ROM in vivo and (2) assess the correlation between IPF and megakaryocyte (MK) mass in newborn and adult treated and untreated mice. In the first set of studies, newborn (day 1) and adult mice received a single subcutaneous (SC) dose of ROM ranging from 0 to 300 ng/g, and platelet counts were followed every other day for 14 days. Both sets of mice responded with dose-dependent platelet and IPF increases, peaking on days 5-7 post-treatment, but neonates had a blunted response (2.1-fold compared to 4.2-fold maximal increase in platelet counts, respectively). On day 5 post-treatment with 300 ng/g ROM, MKs in the bone marrow (BM) and spleen of adult mice were significantly increased in numbers and size (p < 0.0001 for both) compared to controls. MKs in the spleen and BM (but not liver) of treated neonates also increased in number, but not in size. The immature platelet count (IPC, calculated as IPF x platelet count) was highly correlated with the MK number and size in neonatal and adult BM and spleen, but not neonatal liver. The lack of response of neonatal liver MKs was not due to a cell-intrinsic reduced responsiveness to TPO, since neonatal liver progenitors were more sensitive to murine TPO (mTPO) in vitro than adult BM progenitor. In vivo treatment of newborn mice with high mTPO doses or with higher doses of ROM (900 ng/g) resulted in peak platelet counts approaching 3-fold of controls. Taken together, our data indicate that newborn mice are less responsive to ROM than adult mice in vivo, due to a combination of likely pharmacokinetic differences and developmental differences in the response of MKs to thrombopoietic stimulation, evidenced by neonatal MKs increasing in numbers but not in size. PK/PD studies in human infants treated with ROM are warranted.
