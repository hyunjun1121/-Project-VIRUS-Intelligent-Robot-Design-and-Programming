What class of drugs is commonly associated with Drug-induced interstitial lung disease (DIILD)?

[PMID: 2185802]
Cytotoxic agents may cause interstitial or eosinophilic pneumonitis, alveolar proteinosis, pulmonary venous occlusive disease, pulmonary fibrosis, pneumothorax, or pulmonary oedema. These agents may also potentiate lung injury caused by radiotherapy or high oxygen fractions in inspired air. Clinical and roentgenological features of lung damage induced by cytotoxic drugs are usually non-specific, and differential diagnoses include progression of the malignant disease and a plethora of opportunistic infections. Monitoring of blood gases and carbon monoxide transfer factor may facilitate early detection of drug induced lung injury. Fiberoptic bronchoscopy, bronchoalveolar lavage, transbronchial biopsy, or open lung biopsy may be necessary for reliable diagnosis. Early detection of lung damage and immediate withdrawal of the responsible agent(s) are essential. Steroids may be of therapeutic value in some patients.

Drug-induced interstitial lung disease (DI-ILD) is a rare, yet life-threatening complication associated with tyrosine-kinase inhibitor (TKI) therapy. Third-generation epidermal growth factor receptor-TKI, osimertinib use can be associated with a benign radiological finding called transient asymptomatic pulmonary opacities that can be confused with an infectious pulmonary process resulting in overtreatment with antibiotics or premature treatment withdrawal or severe DI-ILD. In this case, our patient with newly diagnosed metastatic non-small cell lung cancer on treatment with osimertinib developed very early onset severe DI-ILD (grade-IV) with a unique pattern of pulmonary involvement and was treated with high-dose corticosteroids with a response. She was later successfully rechallenged with osimertinib and responded well to the treatment. Our case highlights the importance of being cognizant of the possibility that DI-ILD can rarely occur within a week of treatment initiation with osimertinib and safe reintroduction of the drug is possible in select patients following complete resolution of pulmonary radiographic findings and clinical symptoms even with high-grade adverse events.

The problem of the drug induced pulmonary toxicity (cytotoxic and non-cytotoxic drugs) is discussed. This domain of modern pathology is in continuous development, although yet insufficiently delineated. The essential pathogenic mechanisms are presented as well as the main histopathological lesions (i.e., interstitial pneumonia and pulmonary fibrosis). The usual lesional aspects specific to certain drugs are also reviewed. For the principal chemical substances in this category, the clinical and radiological aspects are given, also the various treatment indicated, the evolution and the prognosis of the drugs induced pulmonary disease.

Treatment of patients often includes the administration of medications and sometimes radiation. While the intent is to treat an underlying condition, in some cases, adverse effects occur due to these agents. Most of these adverse effects are mild, however, some can be severe and life-threatening. Furthermore, while these effects are often reversible upon cessation of exposure, especially if the inciting agent is recognized and withdrawn early, others might be permanent or even progressing. Most common histopathologic findings in drug-induced interstitial lung disease include nonspecific interstitial pneumonia (cellular and/or fibrotic), organizing pneumonia with or without bronchiolitis, eosinophilic pneumonia, pulmonary edema, diffuse alveolar damage, hypersensitivity pneumonitis, granulomatous interstitial lung disease, chronic bronchiolitis, and pulmonary hemorrhage. Pulmonary vascular changes or constrictive bronchiolitis can also occur. Drugs that are more commonly associated with lung toxicity include nitrofurantoin, amiodarone, and chemotherapeutic agents such as bleomycin and methotrexate. More recently introduced immune modulating agents including rituximab and immune checkpoint inhibitors such as anti-CTLA4, anti-PD-1 and anti-PD-L1 agents have also been associated with adverse effects in the lung. Radiation therapy to the chest can trigger acute or chronic lung toxicity. While newer radiation techniques are aimed to decrease and minimize side effects other risk factors such as additional chemotherapy, oxygen, and older age may be rising. Foreign substances such as talc, hydrogel, and medical devices such as hydrophilic polymer coated catheter may rarely also lead to pulmonary complications. It is important that clinicians and pathologists are aware of these potential adverse effects of drugs, radiation and medical devices and raise the possibility of drug-induced lung toxicity after exclusion of other differential diagnoses. It is the role of the clinician to provide the pathologist with an appropriate drug history. Early intervention to a drug-induced lung toxicity might prevent progression of side effects and permanent changes.

To review published cases of induced or exacerbated interstitial lung disease (ILD) in rheumatoid arthritis (RA) associated with non-biologic disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs (nbDMARDs) and biologics and to discuss clinical implications in daily practice. We performed a systematic literature review from 1975 to July 2013 using Medline, Embase, Cochrane, and abstracts from the ACR 2010-2012 and EULAR 2010-2013 annual meetings. Case reports and series that suggest a causative role of nbDMARDs (methotrexate [MTX], leflunomide [LEF], gold, azathioprine [AZA], sulfasalazine [SSZ], and hydroxychloroquine [HCQ]) and biologic agents (TNF inhibitors [TNFi], rituximab [RTX], tocilizumab [TCZ], abatacept [ABA], and anakinra) in causing ILD or worsening a pre-existing ILD in RA patients were included. Results from observational and postmarketing studies as well as reviews on this topic were excluded from the qualitative analysis but still considered to discuss the implication of such drugs in generating or worsening ILD in RA patients. Comparisons were made between MTX-induced ILD in RA and the cases reported with other agents, in terms of clinical presentation, radiological features, and therapeutic management and outcomes. The literature search identified 32 articles for MTX, 12 for LEF (resulting in 34 case reports), 3 for gold, 1 for AZA, 4 for SSZ, 27 for TNFi (resulting in 31 case reports), 3 for RTX, 5 for TCZ (resulting in 8 case reports), and 1 for ABA. No case was found for HCQ or anakinra. Common points are noted between LEF- and TNFi-related ILD in RA: ILD is a rare severe adverse event, mostly occurs within the first 20 weeks after initiation of therapy, causes dyspnea mostly in older patients, and can be fatal. Although no definitive causative relationship can be drawn from case reports and observational studies, these data argue for a pulmonary follow-up in RA patients with pre-existing ILD, while receiving biologic therapy or nbDMARDs. As previously described for MTX, growing evidence highlights that LEF, TNFi, RTX, and TCZ may induce pneumonitis or worsen RA-related pre-existing ILD. Nonetheless, identifying a causal relationship between RA therapy and ILD-induced toxicity clearly appears difficult, partly because it is a rare condition.

The pathology of drug-induced pulmonary toxicity in children is poorly understood and probably under-estimated, in the absence of any prospective studies evaluating in a systematic fashion the side effect of medication on the respiratory apparatus. The pulmonary toxicity of thoracic irradiation has markedly receded with more restricted indications for this sort of treatment. Three clinical patterns are most commonly encountered in drug induced lung disease in children: interstitial lung disease, hypersensitivity lung disease and non-cardiogenic pulmonary oedema. The diagnosis is a diagnosis of exclusion and rests on a group of clinical arguments and also on the progress of the disease. Broncho-alveolar lavage rules out infectious disease. Respiratory function tests show non-specific anomalies. A lung biopsy may be indicated. The mechanism of the pulmonary toxicity are associated with disequilibrium of the oxidant/antioxidant and protease/antiprotease system as well as disturbance of the immune response or alteration of the pulmonary matrix by disease of the collagen system. Increased toxicity may be seen in children because of a very significant cumulative dose. The cytotoxic drugs which are most often implicated in causing this are bleomycin, methotrexate, cyclophosphamide and busulfan. Other drugs which are responsible for toxic lung disease are nitrofurantoin, sulfasalazine, D-penicillamine, betalactams, Diphenyl-hydantoin and carbamazepine. Acute post-radiation lung disease is rare. Post-radiation fibrosis is found six months after irradiation and hinders thoraco-pulmonary growth in the child. It is important to assess lung function in all children before any chemotherapy or thoracic irradiation. Cytotoxic drugs are the most common cause of toxic lung disease. This iatrogenic disease requires a multi-discipline approach to ensure the quality of care for these children.

Pulmonary drug toxicity is increasingly being diagnosed as a cause of acute and chronic lung disease. Numerous agents including cytotoxic and noncytotoxic drugs have the potential to cause pulmonary toxicity. The clinical and radiologic manifestations of these drugs generally reflect the underlying histopathologic processes and include diffuse alveolar damage (DAD), nonspecific interstitial pneumonia (NSIP), bronchiolitis obliterans organizing pneumonia (BOOP), eosinophilic pneumonia, obliterative bronchiolitis, pulmonary hemorrhage, edema, hypertension, or veno-occlusive disease. DAD is a common manifestation of pulmonary drug toxicity and is frequently caused by cytotoxic drugs, especially cyclophosphamide, bleomycin, and carmustine. It manifests radiographically as bilateral hetero- or homogeneous opacities usually in the mid and lower lungs and on high-resolution computed tomographic (CT) scans as scattered or diffuse areas of ground-glass opacity. NSIP occurs most commonly as a manifestation of carmustine toxicity or of toxicity from noncytotoxic drugs such as amidarone. At radiography, it appears as diffuse areas of heterogeneous opacity, whereas early CT scans show diffuse ground-glass opacity and late CT scans show fibrosis in a basal distribution. BOOP, which is commonly caused by bleomycin and cyclophosphamide (as well as gold salts and methotrexate), appears on radiographs as hetero- and homogeneous peripheral opacities in both upper and lower lobes and on CT scans as poorly defined nodular consolidation, centrilobular nodules, and bronchial dilatation. Knowledge of these manifestations and of the drugs most frequently involved can facilitate diagnosis and institution of appropriate treatment.

A number of anticancer drugs, especially molecularly-targeted drugs, have been developed every year. Drug-induced interstitial lung disease(DILD)is a common adverse event associated with molecularly-targeted drugs, and it is therefore important to obtain information about the DILD risks of each drug. Recently, all-case surveillance of new drugs have been carried out frequently as post-marketing surveillance. This allows one to understand the accurate status of DILD, such as its incidence rate and prognosis. The diagnosis of DILD is often difficult because there is no specific diagnostic approach. It is necessary to distinguish DILD from various other diseases including infectious disease, cancer progression, congestive heart failure, etc. Among those, respiratory infection is an important disease in the differential diagnosis of DILD, because patients receiving anticancer drugs are likely to be susceptible to infection. As for the treatment of DILD, the general rule is the discontinuation of the offending drug, and if necessary, the administration of corticosteroid is indicated. However, an exceptional treatment is required for DILD caused by mTOR inhibitor, for which we must take account of the adequate management.

A rare but serious complication of epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI) therapy is a lung injury syndrome commonly referred to as a drug-induced interstitial lung disease (ILD). It has a typical clinical presentation of rapidly progressive acute or subacute dyspnea and a histopathology of diffuse alveolar damage (DAD). The incidence, severity, and risk factors for EGFR TKI-induced ILD remain poorly understood. Whether concurrent chemotherapy increases its risk is also unclear. The primary focus of this blinded review was to determine the incidence of ILD leading to death in 1059 TRIBUTE patients randomized to chemotherapy plus erlotinib or placebo. All fatal serious adverse events (SAEs) were reviewed by an independent three-person panel composed of a medical oncologist, radiologist, and pulmonologist not associated with the study and without knowledge of treatment assignment. Fatal respiratory SAEs were identified and assigned to one of four potential attributions: progressive cancer, concurrent illness, drug-induced ILD, or other toxicities not related to ILD. Each panel member first made an independent assignation; then each case was discussed jointly. If needed, consensus was reached by vote. Fatal SAEs were reported in 80 of 1059 patients (7.6%): 53 of 526 patients on erlotinib (10.1%) and 27 of 533 on placebo (5.1%) (p < 0.05). Consensus assignation for 41 fatal respiratory SAEs was as follows: cancer, 18 (44%); concurrent illness, 15 (37%); other toxicities not related to ILD, five (12%); ILD, three (7%). All three ILD cases occurred in the erlotinib arm (3/526; 0.6%). The one biopsy-confirmed case of ILD revealed bronchiolitis obliterans organizing pneumonia, a histopathologic finding that has not previously been reported. All three cases of fatal ILD had a typical clinical presentation of acute or subacute onset of dyspnea with rapid progression to respiratory failure. This independent blinded analysis of the TRIBUTE study identified fatal ILD in 0.6% of cases treated with the combination of erlotinib plus chemotherapy, possibly higher than previous reports of EGFR TKIs alone in the non-Japanese population. Fatal ILD alone does not fully account for the imbalance in fatal SAEs observed in TRIBUTE. EGFR TKI-induced fatal ILD typically presents with acute or subacute dyspnea with rapid progression and a typical histopathology of diffuse alveolar damage both consistent with the acute respiratory distress syndrome, but can also be associated with a histopathology of bronchiolitis obliterans organizing pneumonia. Further studies designed to better understand the underlying pathophysiology and risk factors for ILD are needed.

Treatment of rheumatoid arthritis (RA)-related interstitial lung disease (ILD) is challenging, and many conventional and biologic disease-modifying anti-rheumatic drugs (DMARDs) have been associated with ILD development or progression. The aim of this multicentric retrospective study was to analyze the evolution of ILD in Italian RA-ILD patients treated with abatacept (ABA). All RA-ILD patients treated with ABA for at least six months were retrospectively evaluated. Serology, previous and concurrent therapies, chest high-resolution computer tomography (HRCT), forced vital capacity (FVC), and lung diffusion of carbon monoxide (CO, DLCO) were collected. Forty-four patients were included; HRCT, FVC, and DLCO were analyzed at baseline, at one year, and at the end of follow-up. A remission or a low disease activity of RA was reached in 41/44 patients. Overall, FVC and DLCO remained stable or increased in 86.1% and 91.7% of patients, respectively, while HRCT was stable or improved in 81.4% of them. Previous and concurrent treatments, in particular, methotrexate, serology, age, sex, joint and lung disease duration were not associated with the outcome at univariate analysis. The management of RA-ILD patients remains a critical unmet medical need. Waiting for prospective controlled studies, ABA has shown a good safety profile in our cohort of Italian RA-ILD patients.

Drug-induced interstitial lung disease (DIILD) is a serious side effect of chemotherapy in cancer patients with an extremely high mortality rate. In this study, to identify genetic variants with greater risk of DIILD, we carried out whole genome sequencing (WGS) of germline DNA samples from 26 patients who developed DIILD, and conducted a case-control association study between these 26 cases and general Japanese population controls registered in the integrative Japanese Genome Variation Database (iJGVD) as a screening study. The associations of 42 single nucleotide variants (SNVs) showing P < 0.0001 were further validated using an independent cohort of 18 DIILD cases as a replication study. A further combined analysis of the screening and replication studies showed a possible association of two SNVs, rs35198919 in intron 1 of the chromosome 22 open reading frame 34 (C22orf34) and rs12625311 in intron 1 of the teashirt zinc finger homeobox 2 (TSHZ2), with DIILD (Pcombined = 1.87 × 10-5 and 5.16 × 10-5, respectively). Furthermore, in a subgroup analysis of epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR)-tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI)-induced interstitial lung disease (ILD), we observed seven candidate SNVs that were possibly associated with ILD (P < 0.00001). This is the first study to identify genetic markers for the risk of DIILD using WGS. Collectively, our novel findings indicate that these SNVs may be applicable for predicting the risk of DIILD in patients receiving chemotherapy.

Although pneumothorax has been reported to be a major pulmonary adverse event in patients treated with pazopanib, a multikinase inhibitor, drug-induced interstitial lung disease (DILD) has not been reported. A 74-year-old Japanese man who received pazopanib for the treatment of femoral leiomyosarcoma and lung metastasis presented with dyspnea and fatigue. He had mild interstitial pneumonia when pazopanib treatment was initiated. Chest computed tomography revealed progressive bilateral ground-glass opacity (GGO) and traction bronchiectasis. We diagnosed DILD due to pazopanib. The patient's pazopanib treatment was interrupted and a steroid was administered. The symptoms and GGO were improved with treatment. Physicians should be aware of DILD due to pazopanib in patients with pre-existing interstitial lung disease.

The study objective was to determine the incidence and characteristics of drug-induced interstitial lung disease (ILD) associated with an orally available small-molecule tyrosine kinase inhibitor, crizotinib, in a real-world clinical setting. Post-marketing surveillance was performed in Japan to obtain information on the safety and efficacy of crizotinib. Target patients included all patients with anaplastic lymphoma kinase-positive NSCLC who received crizotinib during the enrollment period between May 2012 and December 2014. The observation period was 52 weeks. Expert analysis of the ILD incidence was performed by an ILD independent review committee composed of five medical specialists. The safety analysis set included 2028 patients, and more than half of the patients (56.4%) were nonsmokers. The incidence of ILD associated with crizotinib therapy was 5.77%; and 3.45% patients showed grade 3 or greater. Pulmonary edema-like shadows with or without diffuse alveolar damage pattern were observed in crizotinib-associated ILD (incidence: 0.39%), but a causal relationship with the prognosis could not be identified. ILD developed within 4 weeks from initiation of crizotinib administration in 41.9% and within 8 weeks in 69.2% of the patients. Age 55 years or older, Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status 2-4, smoking history, previous or concomitant ILD, and comorbid pleural effusion were statistically determined as significant risk factors for crizotinib-induced ILD. Crizotinib therapy should be applied to the NSCLC patients with any of above risk factors under a cautious monitoring for ILD occurrence, and clinicians should pay attention to the risks of severe ILD.

Drug-induced interstitial lung disease (D-ILD) can be caused by various drugs, including antibiotics, amiodarone, antitumor, rheumatological and non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs. D-ILD includes hypersensitivity reactions, organizing and non-specific interstitial pneumonia, eosinophilic lung diseases, diffuse alveolar damage and alveolar hypoventilation. To exclude other causes of pulmonary diseases, an assessment of the medical history, physical data and examination results, which may include chest X-ray/multispiral computed tomography (MSCT), lung function tests, and bronchoscopy with bronchoalveolar lavage, are necessary. Diagnosis of D-ILD is difficult due to the heterogeneity of clinical, radiological and histological data. The X-ray pathological phenotype of D-ILD is different; a specific MSCT pattern has not been identified. Treatment includes drug withdrawal and, in some cases, glucocorticoid therapy, although there are no prospective studies on their effect on the outcome of the disease. This article provides various drugs that cause ILD, approaches to their diagnosis and treatment.

With an increasing number of therapeutic drugs, the list of drugs that is responsible for severe pulmonary disease also grows. Many drugs have been associated with pulmonary complications of various types, including interstitial inflammation and fibrosis, bronchospasm, pulmonary edema, and pleural effusions. Drug-induced interstitial lung disease (DILD) can be caused by chemotherapeutic agents, antibiotics, antiarrhythmic drugs, and immunosuppressive agents. There are no distinct physiologic, radiographic or pathologic patterns of DILD, and the diagnosis is usually made when a patient with interstitial lung disease (ILD) is exposed to a medication known to result in lung disease. Other causes of ILD must be excluded. Treatment is avoidance of further exposure and systemic corticosteroids in patients with progressive or disabling disease.

A 69-year-old woman was diagnosed with a breakpoint cluster region-Abelson-positive chronic myeloid leukaemia and treated with dasatinib for 14 months. She presented with one month of high-grade fever and persistent dry cough. Chest computed tomography revealed non-segmental subpleural consolidation, ground-glass opacities, and interlobular septal thickening. The bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) and transbronchial lung biopsy confirmed a diagnosis of drug-induced interstitial lung disease (ILD) associated with dasatinib. Then, systemic corticosteroid treatment was initiated, which was effective and the interstitial shadow disappeared after two weeks. The acid-fast bacilli culture test of BAL fluid after three weeks was positive for <i>Mycobacterium tuberculosis</i>, and combination therapy with four antituberculosis drugs was added. It is known that drug-induced ILD and susceptibility to infection associated with dasatinib occur in a dose-dependent manner. This is the first case of dasatinib-induced ILD which coincided with active tuberculosis.

Drug-induced interstitial lung disease (DIILD) occurs as a result of numerous agents, but the risk often only becomes apparent after the marketing authorisation of such agents. In this PRISMA-compliant systematic review, we aimed to evaluate and synthesise the current literature on DIILD. Following a quality assessment, 156 full-text papers describing more than 6000 DIILD cases were included in the review. However, the majority of the papers were of low or very low quality in relation to the review question (78%). Thus, it was not possible to perform a meta-analysis, and descriptive review was undertaken instead. DIILD incidence rates varied between 4.1 and 12.4 cases/million/year. DIILD accounted for 3⁻5% of prevalent ILD cases. Cancer drugs, followed by rheumatology drugs, amiodarone and antibiotics, were the most common causes of DIILD. The radiopathological phenotype of DIILD varied between and within agents, and no typical radiological pattern specific to DIILD was identified. Mortality rates of over 50% were reported in some studies. Severity at presentation was the most reliable predictor of mortality. Glucocorticoids (GCs) were commonly used to treat DIILD, but no prospective studies examined their effect on outcome. Overall high-quality evidence in DIILD is lacking, and the current review will inform larger prospective studies to investigate the diagnosis and management of DIILD.

Although gefitinib used for the treatment of non-small-cell lung cancer is a well-known cause of interstitial lung disease (ILD), few case reports on erlotinib-induced ILD have been issued. The common risk factor of both of these two drug-induced ILDs is idiopathic interstitial pneumonia, but ILD in a patient with radiation fibrosis has not been previously reported. Report of a case. We recently experienced a case of fatal erlotinib-induced ILD, diagnosed based on clinical and radiologic findings, which occurred in a patient with radiation fibrosis. A 50-year-old male patient was started on erlotinib as a third-line chemotherapy. Six days after taking erlotinib, a chest radiograph showed rapid progression of reticular infiltration in both lung fields. High-resolution computed tomography scan findings were consistent with ILD, which was sufficient to diagnose as erlotinib-induced ILD. The patient died of respiratory failure after 8 days of steroid infusion and erlotinib discontinuation. Our case shows a fatal side effect of erlotinib. This case had radiation fibrosis, so we suggest that radiation fibrosis may be another contributor of the occurrence of ILD in patients taking erlotinib.
