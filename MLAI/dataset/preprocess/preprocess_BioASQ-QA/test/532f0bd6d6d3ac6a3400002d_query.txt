What is the mode of inheritance of Marchesani syndrome?

[PMID: 10707143]
Weill-Marchesani syndrome is a rare systemic connective tissue disorder consisting of brachymorphy, brachydactyly, ectopia lentis, spherophakia and glaucoma. We report 6 patients with Weill-Marchesani syndrome (with or without ocular involvement) in three generations, identified by screening 26 members of two families. This is the largest family in the literature showing an autosomal dominant pattern of inheritance. Presenile vitreous liquefaction was present in all the younger cases. Weill-Marchesani syndrome was full-blown in two cases in the third generation, in which asymmetrical axial length and glaucomatous damage were present. To our knowledge this is the first report regarding asymmetrical axial length and glaucomatous damage, and presenile vitreous liquefaction in Weill-Marchesani syndrome with or without ocular involvement. The longer axial length might be the precursor of impending severe glaucomatous damage. Presenile vitreous liquefaction in subtle young cases should alert the physician to the diagnosis of Weill-Marchesani syndrome on screening of the family members.

Weill-Marchesani syndrome comprises short stature, brachydactyly, microspherophakia, glaucoma, and ectopia lentis is regarded as an autosomal recessive trait (McKusick 277600). We present two families each with affected individuals in 3 generations demonstrating autosomal dominant inheritance of Weill-Marchesani syndrome. Linkage analysis in these 2 families suggests a gene for Weill-Marchesani syndrome maps to 15q21.1. The dislocated lenses and connective tissue disorder in these families suggests that fibrillin-1 and microfibril-associated protein 1, which both map to 15q21.1, are candidate genes for Weill-Marchesani syndrome. Immunohistochemistry staining of skin sections from family 1 showed an apparent decrease in fibrillin staining compared to control individuals.

The acromelic dysplasia group includes three rare disorders: Weill-Marchesani syndrome (WMS), Geleophysic dysplasia (GD) and Acromicric dysplasia (AD) all characterized by short stature, short hands and stiff joints. The clinical overlap between the three disorders is striking. Indeed, in addition to the diagnostic criteria, they all share common features including delayed bone age, cone shaped epiphyses, thick skin and heart disease. In contrast, a microspherophakic lens seems to be a characteristic feature of WMS whereas hepatomegaly and a severe outcome are encountered only in the most severe forms of GD. Finally, WMS is transmitted either by an autosomal dominant or an autosomal recessive (AR) mode of inheritance, GD by an autosomal recessive mode of inheritance and AD by an autosomal dominant mode of inheritance. Using genetic approaches, we have identified the molecular basis of WMS and GD which both involved the same superfamily of proteins, the ADAMTS [A Disintegrin-like And Metalloproteinase domain (reprolysin type) with ThromboSpondin type 1 repeats (TSR)]. We have found ADAMTS10 mutations in the recessive form of WMS and Fibrillin 1 mutations in the dominant form of WMS. More recently, we have identified ADAMTSL2 mutations in GD. The function of ADAMTS1 0 and AD AMTSL 2 are unknown. But the findings of FBN1 and ADAMTS10 mutations in WMS suggest a direct link between the two proteins. Using a yeast double hybrid screen, we have identified LTBP1 (Latent TGFbeta Binding protein 1) as a partner of ADAMTSL2. The combination of these findings suggests that ADAMTS10 and ADAMTSL2 are both involved in the microfibrillar network.

Weill-Marchesani syndrome is a rare, generalized disorder of connective tissue manifested by short stature, brachymorphia, and spherophakia. Inheritance is autosomal recessive. In the less than 50 reported cases, joint stiffness in the hands and thenar atrophy have been noted in adults. A kindred is reported here in which release of multiple trigger fingers and bilateral carpal tunnel syndrome in childhood has improved hand function in a brother and sister.

Weill-Marchesani syndrome (WMS) is a well-characterized disorder in which patients develop eye and skeletal abnormalities. Autosomal-recessive and autosomal-dominant forms of WMS are caused by mutations in ADAMTS10 and FBN1 genes, respectively. Here we report on 13 patients from seven unrelated families from the Arabian Peninsula. These patients have a constellation of features that fall within the WMS spectrum and follow an autosomal-recessive mode of inheritance. Individuals who came from two families and met the diagnostic criteria for WMS were each found to have a different homozygous missense mutation in ADAMTS10. Linkage analysis and direct sequencing of candidate genes in another two families and a sporadic case with phenotypes best described as WMS-like led to the identification of three homozygous mutations in the closely related ADAMTS17 gene. Our clinical and genetic findings suggest that ADAMTS17 plays a role in crystalline lens zonules and connective tissue formation and that mutations in ADAMTS17 are sufficient to produce some of the main features typically described in WMS.

Weill-Marchesani syndrome (WMS) is a connective tissue disorder characterised by short stature, brachydactyly, joint stiffness, and characteristic eye anomalies including microspherophakia, ectopia of the lenses, severe myopia, and glaucoma. Both autosomal recessive (AR) and autosomal dominant (AD) modes of inheritance have been described and a gene for AR WMS has recently been mapped to chromosome 19p13.3-p13.2. Here, we report on the exclusion of chromosome 19p13.3-p13.2 in a large AD WMS family and show that, despite clinical homogeneity, AD and AR WMS are genetically heterogeneous entities. Because two AD WMS families were consistent with linkage to chromosome 15q21.1, the fibrillin-1 gene was sequenced and a 24 nt in frame deletion within a latent transforming growth factor-beta1 binding protein (LTBP) motif of the fibrillin-1 gene was found in a AD WMS family (exon 41, 5074_5097del). This in frame deletion cosegregated with the disease and was not found in 186 controls. This study strongly suggests that AD WMS and Marfan syndrome are allelic conditions at the fibrillin-1 locus and adds to the remarkable clinical heterogeneity of type I fibrillinopathies.

Weill-Marchesani syndrome (WMS) is a rare condition characterized by short stature, brachydactyly, joint stiffness, and characteristic eye abnormalities including microspherophakia, ectopia of lens, severe myopia, and glaucoma. Both autosomal recessive (AR) and autosomal dominant (AD) modes of inheritance have been described for WMS. A locus for AR WMS has recently been mapped to chromosome 19p13.3-p13.2 while mutation within the fibrillin-1 gene (15q21.1) was found in one AD WMS family. In order to answer the question of whether or not genetic heterogeneity could be related to a clinical heterogeneity, we reviewed 128 WMS patients from the literature (including 57 AR, 50 AD, and 21 sporadic cases), with a particular attention to clinical features. Statistical analyses using Fischer exact test were used to compare the proportions of 12 clinical parameters between AR and AD patients. There was no significant difference between both groups for myopia, glaucoma, cataract, short stature, brachydactyly, thick skin, muscular build, and mental retardation. Significant results were found for microspherophakia (94% in AR, 74% in AD, Fischer 0.007), ectopia lentis (64% in AR, 84% in AD, Fischer 0.016), joint limitations (49% in AR, 77% in AD, Fischer 0.010), and cardiac anomalies (39% in AR, 13% in AD, Fischer 0.004). Nevertheless, we failed to distinguish AR from AD inheritance in individual cases. These results support the clinical homogeneity but the genetic heterogeneity of WMS.

Weill-Marchesani syndrome (WMS) is a rare disease characterized by short stature, brachydactyly, joint stiffness, and characteristic eye abnormalities, including microspherophakia, ectopia lentis, and glaucoma. Both autosomal recessive and autosomal dominant modes of inheritance have been described in association with WMS. We have performed a genome-wide search in two large consanguineous families of Lebanese and Saudian origin consistent with an autosomal recessive mode of inheritance. Here, we report the linkage of the disease gene to chromosome 19p13.3-p13.2 (Zmax=5.99 at theta=0 at locus D19S906). A recombination event between loci D19S905 and D19S901 defines the distal boundary, and a second recombination event between loci D19S221 and D19S840 defines the proximal boundary of the genetic interval encompassing the WMS gene (12.4 cM). We hope that our ongoing studies will lead to the identification of the disease-causing gene.
