Rachmilewitz Index is used for which diseases?

[PMID: 30130840]
Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) is considered a chronic condition characterized by mucosal or transmural inflammation in the gastrointestinal tract. Endoscopic diagnosis and surveillance in patients with IBD have become crucial. In addition, endoscopy is a useful modality in estimation and evaluation of the disease, treatment results, and efficacy of treatment delivery and surveillance. In relation to these aspects, endoscopic disease activity has been commonly estimated in clinical practices and trials.<br/> At present, many endoscopic indices of ulcerative colitis have been introduced, including the Truelove and Witts Endoscopy Index, Baron Index, Powell-Tuck Index, Sutherland Index, Mayo Clinic Endoscopic Sub-Score, Rachmilewitz Index, Modified Baron Index, Endoscopic Activity Index, Ulcerative Colitis Endoscopic Index of Severity, Ulcerative Colitis Colonoscopic Index of Severity, and Modified Mayo Endoscopic Score. Endoscopic indices have been also suggested for Crohn's disease, such as the Crohn's Disease Endoscopic Index of Severity, Simple Endoscopic Score for Crohn's Disease, and Rutgeerts Postoperative Endoscopic Index. However, most endoscopic indices have not been validated owing to the complexity of their parameters and inter-observer variations. Therefore, a chronological approach for understanding the various endoscopic indices relating to IBD is needed to improve the management.

Improving health-related quality of life is a primary target of therapy for patients with inflammatory bowel disease. Physical activity has been demonstrated to improve health-related quality of life in several patient populations with chronic disease. There are very few studies investigating the effects of physical activity on health-related quality of life in inflammatory bowel disease. The primary purpose of this study is to investigate the effects of 10 weeks of moderate physical activity on health-related quality of life in patients with inflammatory bowel disease. Thirty patients with mild to moderate IBD (Crohn's Disease Activity Index (CDAI) <220 or Rachmilewitz Index (RI) <11) were randomized 1:1 to either supervised moderate-intensity running thrice a week for 10 weeks or a control group who were not prescribed any exercise. Health-related quality of life, symptoms, and inflammation were assessed at baseline and after 10 weeks. Participants were 41 ± 14 years (73% female), had a body mass index of 22.8 ± 4.1 kg/m(2), and an average CDAI or RI of 66.8 ± 42.4 and 3.6 ± 3.1. No adverse events occurred during the 10-week training period. Health-related quality of life, reported as IBDQ total score, improved 19% in the intervention group and 8% in the control group. Scores for the IBDQ social sub-scale were significantly improved in the intervention group compared with controls (ΔIBDQsocial = 6.27 ± 5.46 vs. 1.87 ± 4.76, p = 0.023). Patients suffering from moderately active IBD are capable of performing symptom-free regular endurance exercise. Our data support the assumption that PA is feasible in IBD patients. PA may furthermore improve quality of life through improvements in social well-being, and may, therefore, be a useful adjunct to IBD therapy.

To elaborate optimal cell culture administration regimens to enhance the efficiency of anti-inflammatory therapy for inflammatory bowel diseases. Three groups of patients with chronic continuous or chronic recurrent ulcerative colitis (UC) were formed according to the treatment option: 1) 15 patients with UC, in whom mesenchymal stromal cells (MSC) were thrice administered for a month at a one-week interval; 2) 20 patients with UC who received MSC once; 3) 20 patients with UC who had standard anti-inflammatory therapy with 5-aminosalycilic acid (5-ASA) preparations and glucocorticosteroids (GCS). The clinical activity of UC was evaluated using the Rachmilewitz index; its endoscopic pattern was assessed with the Mayo index. UC histological specimens were scored using the Gebs scale. To ascertain the duration of remission, the authors used the Kaplan-Maier survival curve method and calculated relative risk (RR) and odds ratio with 95% confidence intervals. Following 12 months, allogeneic bone marrow (BM) MSC transplantation performed thrice during a month caused the greatest reduction in the Rachmilewitz clinical activity index, Mayo endoscopic activity index, and Gebs pathohistological index in patients with UC as compared to those who had underwent one transplantation or received 5-ASA preparations and GCS (p < 0.05). The duration of remission also depended on the chosen therapy option for UC and the frequency of cell culture administration: the longer duration was recorded in patients who were infused thrice with allogeneic BM MSC. In the patients who had undergone one MSC administration, the risk of recurrent UC was higher than in those who had received MSC thrice during a month (a 2-year follow-up) and comparable with the RR of recurrent UC in the patient receiving only 5-ASA preparations, GCS, and/or immunosuppressants.

Ulcerative colitis (UC) and Crohn's disease (CD) are the nonspecific inflammatory bowel diseases with unknown etiology. Existing diagnostic methods are in many cases insufficient for proper diagnosis and choice of treatment method. In 10% cases of inflammatory bowel disease indeterminate colitis (IC) is described. It includes cases with diverse clinical manifestations, range and histopathological picture. New methods to distinguish inflammatory bowel diseases, chose proper treatment and monitor their activity are searched. Anti-Saccharomyces cerevisiae antibodies (ASCA) and antineutrophil cytoplasmatic antibodies (pANCA) seem to be a new markers used in this end. Comparison of ASCA and pANCA appearance in CD and UC searching of correlation between serum levels of antibodies, activity and clinical picture of disease and appearance of ASCA and pANCA in IC. We examined 63 patients with UC aged 24 to 74 (30 men and 33 women), 14 patients with CD aged 27 to 64 (10 men and 4 women) and 11 patients with IC aged 21 to 53 (4 men and 7 women). Mean duration time of diseases respectively for UC, CD and IC was 7.9 (from 1.0 to 32), 9 (from 1 to 20) and 3.04 (0.5 to 7) years. Diagnosis in specific clinical picture was established with endoscopic and histopathologic examination. Disease activity was described according to Rachmilewitz scale in UC and in CD according to Crohn's disease activity index (CDAI). Control group consisted of 24 healthy men. Examination of pANCA, IgA and IgG ACSA was performed with ELISA kits respectively by Congent Diagnostics and Genesis Diagnostic. There were 39 of UC patients and of CD patients with active disease according to Rachmilewitz scale (above 3 points) and CDAI. We observed statistically more often pANCA in patients with UC (58%; n=31) than in patients with CD (28%; n=4) (p<0.05). Both IgA and IgG ACSCA occurred more often in patients with CD (57%; n=8) than in patients with UC (24%; n=15) (p<0.05). There were no significant differences between antibodies according to duration time, activity, location and treatment method of diseases. Obtained results besides the help with understanding of pathologic mechanisms, indicate for use of antibodies as an diagnostic tool in inflammatory bowel diseases.

The combination of clinical remission and mucosal healing represents a major goal of different treatment strategies for ulcerative colitis (UC). This study aimed to assess which of the endoscopic indices used to evaluate mucosal changes in UC are correlated with clinical indices currently used to determine disease activity, as well as which of the endoscopic indices are correlated with the Geboes Index used for histological evaluation. It also aimed to find correlations between the currently used clinical activity indices and the histological Geboes Index. A group of 49 patients with a confirmed diagnosis of UC and a group of 52 individuals without a diagnosis of gastrointestinal disease, who constituted the control group, were investigated. All patients were evaluated by colonoscopy, and the severity of mucosal changes was scored in terms of nine different endoscopic indices commonly used in both pharmacological trials and clinical practice. Evaluation was also carried out using clinical and histological indices. Endoscopic indices used for UC were then correlated with different clinical and histological indices to find the strongest correlations. A high correlation was demonstrated between three of the 11 evaluated clinical indices - Improvement Based on Individual Symptom Scores, Ulcerative Colitis Disease Activity Index, and Schroeder Index - and all nine endoscopic indices - Ulcerative Colitis Endoscopic Index of Severity, Baron Score, Schroeder Index, Feagan Index, Powell-Tuck Index, Rachmilewitz Index, Sutherland Index, Lofberg Index, and Lemman Index. Improvement Based on Individual Symptom Scores was the index with the highest correlation with all the endoscopic indices used for UC. The above indices are recommended for clinical evaluation of UC activity. The Ulcerative Colitis Endoscopic Index of Severity was moderately correlated with a histological index, and it is therefore recommended for routine endoscopic mucosal evaluation in patients with UC.

82 consecutive outpatients with Crohn's disease (n = 52) and ulcerative colitis (n = 30) were examined ambulatory. Rheumatic complaints, objective results and diagnosis were correlated to the activity of the underlying illness and the extent of the bowel affected. 61% of the examined patients complaint about rheumatic pains. In two thirds this could be attributed to noninflammatory causes (30% insertion tendinitis. 16% degenerative arthritis, 16% wrong carriage), which appeared to be independent of the activity and severity of the underlying disease. One fourth of the rheumatic complaints was caused by inflammation (21% arthritis, 5% sacroileitis). In these cases a dependency on the disease activity and the extent of the colon involvement could be found. No cause was found for 12% of the rheumatic complaints. In patients with ulcerative colitis suffering from arthritis a significant increase of disease activity (Rachmilewitz index) could be shown as compared to ulcerative colitis patients without arthritis (p < 0.02). For patients with Crohn's disease no significant correlation between arthritis and disease activity could be established. In these cases the occurrence of arthritis was associated with the colon involvement (Chi2 = 8.48). The data indicate the high frequency of rheumatic complaints in inflammatory bowel diseases due to noninflammatory causes.

Fecal biomarkers have emerged as an important tool for assessing and monitoring disease activity in patients with inflammatory bowel diseases (IBDs). We performed a prospective head-to-head comparison of the diagnostic accuracy of both fecal calprotectin (fCal) and neopterin (fNeo), and serum C-reactive protein in predicting endoscopic disease severity in patients with IBD. A total of 133 consecutive patients with IBD (78 Crohn's disease [CD] and 55 ulcerative colitis [UC]) undergoing a colonoscopy provided fecal samples for the measurement of fCal and fNeo concentrations and a blood sample for the serum C-reactive protein measurement. Endoscopic disease activities were scored independently according to the Simple Endoscopic Score for CD in patients with CD and to the Rachmilewitz Index in patients with UC. The respective performances of the fecal markers with respect to endoscopic disease severity were assessed by computing correlations, sensitivities, specificities, and overall accuracies at adjusted cutoffs and also test operating characteristics. The fCal and fNeo concentrations differed significantly in clinically and endoscopically active IBD when compared with those in patients with inactive disease. Both fCal and fNeo concentrations correlated closer with endoscopic scores in UC (r = 0.75 and r = 0.72, respectively; P < 0.0001 for both) than in CD (r = 0.53 and r = 0.47, respectively; P < 0.0001 for both). Using cutoffs of 250 μg/g for fCal and 200 pmol/g for fNeo, both fecal markers had similar overall accuracies to predict endoscopic activity in patients with CD (74%) and also a higher and similar accuracies (88% and 90%, respectively) in patients with UC, whereas accuracies of C-reactive protein were slightly lower in patients with CD and UC. The fNeo is a novel reliable surrogate biomarker with the potential to identify patients with IBD with active mucosal lesions and represents an alternative marker as accurate as fCal to predict and monitor the severity of mucosal damages in patients with IBD.

Scoring systems for assessment of clinical activity of IBD were used to evaluate 62 children with IBD (14 with CD, 35 with CU and 13 with CNS). The PCDAI system was most effective in children with CD. In children with CU, both modified Truelove-Witts and Rachmilewitz indexes are equally effective, however use of the Truelove-Witts scale is simpler. The Rachmilewitz scale is better in distinguishing between UC and CNS.

The accuracy of noninvasive markers for the detection of endoscopically active ulcerative colitis (UC) according the Rachmilewitz Score is so far unknown. The aim was to evaluate the correlation between endoscopic disease activity and fecal calprotectin, Clinical Activity Index, C-reactive protein (CRP), and blood leukocytes. UC patients undergoing colonoscopy were prospectively enrolled and scored independently according the endoscopic and clinical part of the Rachmilewitz Index. Patients and controls provided fecal and blood samples for measuring calprotectin, CRP, and leukocytes. Values in UC patients (n = 134) compared to controls (n = 48): calprotectin: 396 ± 351 versus 18.1 ± 5 μg/g, CRP 16 ± 13 versus 3 ± 2 mg/L, blood leukocytes 9.9 ± 3.5 versus 5.4 ± 1.9 g/L (all P < 0.001). Endoscopic disease activity correlated closest with calprotectin (Spearman's rank correlation coefficient r = 0.834), followed by Clinical Activity Index (r = 0.672), CRP (r = 0.503), and leukocytes (r = 0.461). Calprotectin levels were significantly lower in UC patients with inactive disease (endoscopic score 0-3, calprotectin 42 ± 38 μg/g), compared to patients with mild (score 4-6, calprotectin 210 ± 121 μg/g, P < 0.001), moderate (score 7-9, calprotectin 392 ± 246 μg/g, P = 0.002), and severe disease (score 10-12, calprotectin 730 ± 291 μg/g, P < 0.001). The overall accuracy for the detection of endoscopically active disease (score ≥4) was 89% for calprotectin, 73% for Clinical Activity Index, 62% for elevated CRP, and 60% for leukocytosis. Fecal calprotectin correlated closest with endoscopic disease activity, followed by Clinical Activity Index, CRP, and blood leukocytes. Furthermore, fecal calprotectin was the only marker that reliably discriminated inactive from mild, moderate, and highly active disease, which emphasizes its usefulness for activity monitoring.

Calcineurin inhibitors are highly effective in patients with corticosteroid-refractory ulcerative colitis (UC). When therapy with calcineurin inhibitors fails, adalimumab can be considered to avoid colectomy. The efficacy and safety of this sequential alternative salvage therapy remain unknown. Therefore, the present study was performed to investigate the short- and long-term efficacy and safety of adalimumab after failure of calcineurin inhibitors in corticosteroid-refractory UC. Patients with a corticosteroid-refractory flare of UC who did not respond to calcineurin inhibitors and received continuing salvage therapy with adalimumab were included in this retrospective, observational, single-centre study. The cumulative rates of colectomy were calculated using the Kaplan-Meier method. Clinical remission and response were evaluated based on the Rachmilewitz index. The cumulative rates of colectomy were calculated. Predictive factors for clinical remission and colectomy were identified. In the safety evaluation, any adverse event occurring after the administration of adalimumab was considered. Forty-one patients were enrolled; 78% had extensive colitis and 87% had moderate to severe colitis. Seventeen patients (41%) underwent colectomy during the follow-up period. At week 8, 26, and 52 after adalimumab injection, 27%, 39%, and 32% of patients achieved clinical remission, respectively. The adverse event rate was 17%, including one case of tuberculosis. The efficacy of adalimumab for calcineurin inhibitor-refractory UC was examined for the first time. Treatment with adalimumab avoided the need for colectomy in two-thirds of patients with corticosteroid-refractory UC in whom calcineurin inhibitors had failed. However, attention is needed to avoid adverse events, especially infection.

The aim of this study was to assess the concordance between the Rachmilewitz endoscopic activity index (EAI) and the Harpaz histopathological activity scoring system (HSS), which are used for evaluating the disease activity of ulcerative colitis (UC). This study included 109 patients with UC. Based on the disease extent, patients were divided into two groups as left-sided colitis and pancolitis. Patients were grouped as inactive, mild, moderate and severe depending on the Rachmilewitz EAI and Harpaz HSS. Kendal's tau and kappa (x03BA;) statistics were used to assess the agreement between endoscopic and histopathological scores. A receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve was also analyzed to evaluate the sensitivity and specificity of endoscopic scores to predict inactive histopathological disease. In the left-sided colitis group, there were slight and poor agreements in the inactive endoscopic subscores (ESS) with inactive Harpaz HSS (x03BA;: 0.598, p < 0.001) and moderate ESS with moderate Harpaz HSS (x03BA;: 0.236, p = 0.046). There was no agreement between mild ESS and mild Harpaz HSS and between severe ESS and severe Harpaz HSS (x03BA;: 0.071, p = 0.573 and x03BA;: 0.160, p = 0.151, respectively). In the pancolitis group, there was no significant agreement between inactive, mild, moderate and severe ESS and the equivalent Harpaz HSS grades (x03BA;: -0.194, p = 0.187; x03BA;: 0.125, p = 0.397; x03BA;: 0.148, p = 0.175 and x03BA;: 0.174, p = 0.153, respectively). The ROC curve showed that the ESS indicating inactive disease had a low sensitivity to predict histologically inactive disease. The concordance between the endoscopic and histopathological indices was poor. Using both scores in the follow-up of patients with UC is necessary for treatment planning.

Granulocyte-monocyte apheresis (GMA) is an emerging therapeutic option in active course of ulcerative colitis (UC). Appropriate GMA dose, including total number, frequency, and duration of the individual GMA session, is a matter of debate. It was the aim of the present study to evaluate the efficacy of a dose-intensified GMA regimen in patients with moderately to severely active UC. A prospective open-label, single-center study was performed in 10 patients with active UC (Rachmilewitz Clinical Activity Index [CAI] ≥ 8 points; Rachmilewitz Endoscopic Index ≥ 7 points). Patients had failed to improve after treatment with steroids and/or immunomodulators. GMA was performed twice weekly for 2 h to a maximum of 10 sessions. In each GMA session, the adsorber was changed after 1 h of treatment time. Four patients achieved remission with a CAI ≤ 4 points. Three patients had a response with an improvement of CAI of ≥3 points. Three patients showed no benefit from GMA. The quality of life score determined by the inflammatory bowel disease questionnaire-Deutschland increased by 26 points in median. First and second filters had similar efficiency in granulocyte and monocyte adsorption. No major adverse effects were observed. Dose-intensified GMA as reported in this study provided an encouraging short-term response rate of 70% in patients with moderately to severely active UC not responding to standard steroid or immunomodulator therapy. Although all patients relapsed not later than 16 weeks, GMA might be useful to reduce steroid and immunomodulator usage, or to delay surgery in this patient group.

The aim of this study was to evaluate plasma transforming growth factor-B1 concentration in patients with inflammatory bowel disease at different stages of disease activation and to compare these values with those of healthy controls. A total of 70 patients (31 women) evaluated in the Inflammatory Bowel Disease Clinics of TUrkiye YUksek Ihtisas Hospital, Gastroenterology Department, and 20 healthy controls (10 women) were enrolled in the study. Serum samples were obtained from 40 patients with ulcerative colitis (female/male: 18/22, mean age: 41.5+/-12), 30 patients with Crohn's disease (female/male: 17/13, mean age: 36.9+/-1.9) and 20 healthy controls (female/ male: 10/10, mean age: 32.1+/-1.7). The control group included normal blood donors without gastrointestinal complaints or a familial history of inflammatory bowel disease. Clinical activity in Chron's disease was measured by Crohn disease activity index and in ulcerative colitis patients by Rachmilewitz endoscopic index. Chron's disease patients with a Chron's disease activity index >150 and ulcerative colitis patients with a Rachmilewitz index > or =4 were accepted to have active disease. Determination of transforming growth factor-B1 level was performed with the enzyme- linked immunosorbent assay. Serum transforming growth factor-B1 levels were measured as: Chron's disease 1133.3+/-766.5 pg/ml, ulcerative colitis 1362.5+/-880.6 pg/ml and control group 1230.0+/-572.7 pg/ml. There were no significant differences between the three groups. In patients with active disease in ulcerative colitis, transforming growth factor-B1 level was measured as 1952.5+/-543.7, while this value was 772.5+/-750.5 in patientsin remission in ulcerative colitis. There was a significant difference between patients with active ulcerative colitis and remission ulcerative colitis. In inflammatory bowel disease, transforming growth factor-B1 can be used as a marker for differential diagnosis of active ulcerative colitis patients and remission ulcerative colitis patients. Nevertheless, more studies with larger patient groups are necessary.

We aimed to identify ischemia-modified albumin (IMA) levels in inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) and IBD subgroups, and to examine its relation with disease activity index. Sixty-eight patients with IBD (35 ulcerative colitis [UC] and 33 crohn disease [CD]) and 65 healthy volunteers were included in the study. Rachmilewitz scoring system (endoscopic activity index [EAI]) was used to determine UC activity, and as for CD activity, CD activity index (CDAI) scoring was used. IMA measurement was performed with ELISA kit. Ischemia-modified albumin levels in IBD, UC, and CD groups were comparably higher than the control group (37.7 ng/mL vs 42.4 ng/mL vs 36.4 ng/mL vs 21.8 ng/mL, respectively; P < 0.05). In IBD group, a positive correlation was identified between IMA level and CRP (r = 0.325, P = 0.011), EAI(r = 0.302, P = 0.020), and CDAI (r = 0.311, P = 0.013). In stepwise regression model; it was identified that IMA(OR = 1.496; P = 0.016) and CRP(OR = 3.457; P = 0.015) are predictors of IBD in comparison with the control group. In linear regression model, it was identified that risk factors such as log(IMA) and log(CRP) were independent predictors of log(CDAI) and log(EAI) levels. This is the first study showing that IMA levels in IBD were determined higher in comparison with the control group. Moreover, IMA being a predictor for IBD and being positively correlated with disease activity indexes were determined for the first time in the study. In accordance with these results, it is possible to say that IMA in IBD might be related with the pathogenesis of disease and correlated with the severity of the disease.

To investigate whether anxiety and depression levels are associated with Heat Shock Protein 70 (HSP70) induction in the colon of patients with ulcerative colitis (UC). The design was cross-sectional. Clinical activity was assessed by the Rachmilewitz Index (CAI). Three psychometric questionnaires were used: Zung Depression Rating Scale (ZDRS), Spielberg State-Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI), Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS). Colon biopsies were obtained from each affected anatomical site. Severity of inflammation was assessed by eosin/hematoxylin. Constitutive (HSP70c) and inducible (HSP70i) HSP70 expression were immunohistochemically studied. 29 UC patients were enrolled (69% men). Mean age was 46.5 years (SD: 19.5). Inflammation severity was moderate in 17 patients, severe in 6, and mild in 6. The mean number of years since diagnosis was 7.9 (SD: 6.5). The mean CAI was 6.4 (SD: 3.1). In active UC, there was downregulation of HSP70c in inflamed epithelium, without significant HSP70 induction. In 22/29 cases of active cryptitis, polymorphonuclear cells (PMN) clearly expressed HSP70i, with weak, focal positivity in the other 7 cases. Except for the hospital anxiety scale, scores in all psychometric tools were higher in patients with strong HSP70i immunoreactivity in the PMN. Logistic regression showed a strong positive relationship between HSP70i immunoreactivity in the PMN cells and scores in the trait anxiety, ZDRS, and hospital depression scales, (Odds ratios 1.3, 1.3, and 1.5; P = 0.018, 0.023, and 0.038; Wald test, 5.6, 5.2, and 4.3 respectively) and a weaker but significant positive correlation with the CAI (Odds ratio 1.654; P = 0.049; Wald test 3.858). HSP70 is induced in PMN cells of UC patients and its induction correlates with depression and anxiety levels.

The association between inflammatory bowel disease and pulmonary involvement has not been clearly established. The aim of this prospective study was to define the features of pulmonary function tests and high resolution computed tomography in inflammatory bowel disease patients and the relation between these and disease activity. Fifty-two patients with inflammatory bowel disease (20 with Crohn's disease and 32 with ulcerative colitis) were enrolled. The standard pulmonary function tests and thorax high resolution computed tomography findings were investigated with respect to inflammatory bowel disease activity. Crohn's disease activity index and the Rachmilewitz endoscopic activity index for ulcerative colitis were used to assess disease activity. Medications used and smoking status were also documented. Among the patients with ulcerative colitis, 6.25% had an obstructive and/or restrictive ventilatory defect compared with 25% of the patients with Crohn's disease. Fifty percent of the patients with ulcerative colitis and 60% of the patients with Crohn's disease showed abnormal findings in high resolution computed tomography. Pulmonary function tests and high resolution computed tomography abnormalities did not differ significantly between Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis. No significant difference related to inflammatory bowel disease activity was found (P > 0.05). Findings of high resolution computed tomography and the pulmonary function tests did not differ between ulcerative colitis and Crohn's disease. Bowel disease activity did not seem to affect these measurements.
