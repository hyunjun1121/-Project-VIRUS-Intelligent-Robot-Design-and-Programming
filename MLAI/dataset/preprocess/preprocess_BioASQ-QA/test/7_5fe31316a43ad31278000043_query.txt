What induces downstream of gene (DoG) readthrough transcription?

[PMID: 28928151]
Transcription is a highly regulated process, and stress-induced changes in gene transcription have been shown to play a major role in stress responses and adaptation. Genome-wide studies reveal prevalent transcription beyond known protein-coding gene loci, generating a variety of RNA classes, most of unknown function. One such class, termed downstream of gene-containing transcripts (DoGs), was reported to result from transcriptional readthrough upon osmotic stress in human cells. However, how widespread the readthrough phenomenon is, and what its causes and consequences are, remain elusive. Here we present a genome-wide mapping of transcriptional readthrough, using nuclear RNA-Seq, comparing heat shock, osmotic stress, and oxidative stress in NIH 3T3 mouse fibroblast cells. We observe massive induction of transcriptional readthrough, both in levels and length, under all stress conditions, with significant, yet not complete, overlap of readthrough-induced loci between different conditions. Importantly, our analyses suggest that stress-induced transcriptional readthrough is not a random failure process, but is rather differentially induced across different conditions. We explore potential regulators and find a role for HSF1 in the induction of a subset of heat shock-induced readthrough transcripts. Analysis of public datasets detected increases in polymerase II occupancy in DoG regions after heat shock, supporting our findings. Interestingly, DoGs tend to be produced in the vicinity of neighboring genes, leading to a marked increase in their antisense-generating potential. Finally, we examine genomic features of readthrough transcription and observe a unique chromatin signature typical of DoG-producing regions, suggesting that readthrough transcription is associated with the maintenance of an open chromatin state.

In cells productively infected with adenovirus type 5, transcription is not terminated between the E1a gene and the adjacent downstream E1b gene. Insertion of the mouse beta(maj)-globin transcription termination sequence (GGT) into the E1a coding region dramatically reduces early, but not late, E1b expression (E. Falck-Pedersen, J. Logan, T. Shenk, and J. E. Darnell, Jr., Cell 40:897-905, 1985). In the study described herein, we showed that base substitution mutations in the globin DNA that specifically relieved transcription termination also restored early E1b promoter activity in cis, establishing that maximal early E1b expression requires readthrough transcription originating from the adjacent upstream gene. To identify potential targets of readthrough activation, a series of recombinant viruses with double mutations was constructed. Each double-mutant virus strain had the transcription termination sequences in the first exon of E1a and a deletion within the transcription control region of E1b. Early E1b expression from the double-mutant strains was more defective than that from strains containing either mutation alone, indicating that the deleted regions (positions -362 to -35) are not the target for readthrough activation. Two findings suggested that a cis-dominant property of early viral templates is important for readthrough activation. First, the early E1b defect caused by the GGT insertion was not complemented in trans by factors present in late-infected cells. Second, restoration of E1b transcription at late times occurred concurrently with viral DNA replication. Readthrough activation may help convert virion DNA into a transcriptionally competent template prior to DNA replication and late transcription.

Recent studies have described a widespread induction of transcriptional readthrough as a consequence of various stress conditions in mammalian cells. This novel phenomenon, initially identified from analysis of RNA-seq data, suggests intriguing new levels of gene expression regulation. However, the mechanism underlying naturally occurring transcriptional readthrough, as well as its regulatory consequences, still remain elusive. Furthermore, the readthrough response to stress has thus far not been investigated outside of mammalian species, and the occurrence of readthrough in many physiological and disease conditions remains to be explored. To facilitate a wider investigation into transcriptional readthrough, we created the DoGFinder software package, for the streamlined identification and quantification of readthrough transcripts, also known as DoGs (Downstream of Gene-containing transcripts), from any RNA-seq dataset. Using DoGFinder, we explore the dependence of DoG discovery potential on RNA-seq library depth, and show that stress-induced readthrough induction discovery is robust to sequencing depth, and input parameter settings. We further demonstrate the use of the DoGFinder software package on a new publically available RNA-seq dataset, and discover DoG induction in human PME cells following hypoxia - a previously unknown readthrough inducing stress type. DoGFinder will enable users to explore, in a few simple steps, the readthrough phenomenon in any condition and organism. DoGFinder is freely available at https://github.com/shalgilab/DoGFinder .

Naturally occurring stress-induced transcriptional readthrough is a recently discovered phenomenon, in which stress conditions lead to dramatic induction of long transcripts as a result of transcription termination failure. In 2015, we reported the induction of such downstream of gene (DoG) containing transcripts upon osmotic stress in human cells, while others observed similar transcripts in virus-infected and cancer cells. Using the rigorous methodology Cap-Seq, we demonstrated that DoGs result from transcriptional readthrough, not de novo initiation. More recently, we presented a genome-wide comparison of NIH3T3 mouse cells subjected to osmotic, heat, and oxidative stress and concluded that massive induction of transcriptional readthrough is a hallmark of the mammalian stress response. In their recent letter, Huang and Liu in contrast claim that DoG transcripts result from novel transcription initiation near the ends of genes. Their conclusions rest on analyses of a publicly available transcription start site (TSS-Seq) dataset from unstressed NIH3T3 cells. Here, we present evidence that this dataset identifies not only true transcription start sites, TSSs, but also 5'-ends of numerous snoRNAs, which are generally processed from introns in mammalian cells. We show that failure to recognize these erroneous assignments in the TSS-Seq dataset, as well as ignoring published Cap-Seq data on TSS mapping during osmotic stress, have led to misinterpretation by Huang and Liu. We conclude that, contrary to the claims made by Huang and Liu, TSS-Seq reads near gene ends cannot explain the existence of DoGs, nor their stress-mediated induction. Rather it is, as we originally demonstrated, transcriptional readthrough that leads to the formation of DoGs.

In recent years, the realization that most of the genome is transcribed has transformed the study of mammalian gene expression. Much effort has gone into investigating how this pervasive transcription is regulated and what the functions of the resulting transcripts are, if any. We recently discovered that stress-induced transcriptional readthrough generates very long downstream of gene containing transcripts (DoGs), which may explain up to 20% of intergenic transcription. DoGs are induced by osmotic stress at the level of transcription by a mechanism that depends on calcium release from the endoplasmic reticulum mediated by IP3 receptors. Here, we discuss DoG induction and function in the context of the literature, with special focus on 2 outstanding questions. First, we discuss possible molecular mechanisms underlying DoG induction through reduced transcription termination. Second, we explore how DoGs may function in maintaining euchromatin after nuclear scaffold stress. In short, we review important aspects of DoG biogenesis and function, and provide an outlook for continued DoG study.

The calcium ion (Ca<sup>2+</sup>) is a key intracellular signaling molecule with far-reaching effects on many cellular processes. One of the most important such Ca<sup>2+</sup> regulated processes is transcription. A body of literature describes the effect of Ca<sup>2+</sup> signaling on transcription initiation as occurring mainly through activation of gene-specific transcription factors by Ca<sup>2+</sup>-induced signaling cascades. However, the reach of Ca<sup>2+</sup> extends far beyond the first step of transcription. In fact, Ca<sup>2+</sup> can regulate all phases of transcription, with additional effects on transcription-associated events such as alternative splicing. Importantly, Ca<sup>2+</sup> signaling mediates reduced transcription termination in response to certain stress conditions. This reduction allows readthrough transcription, generating a highly inducible and diverse class of downstream of gene containing transcripts (DoGs) that we have recently described.

Previous studies demonstrated that massive induction of transcriptional readthrough generates downstream of gene-containing transcripts (DoGs) in cells under stress condition. Here, we analyzed TSS-seq (transcription start site sequencing) data from the DBTSS database. We investigated TSS tags at the end of gene for all pan-stress and untreated-cell DoGs, in comparison with expression-matched non-DoGs. We observed significantly more TSS tags at the end of pan-stress and untreated-cell DoG genes than non-DoG genes, even though their TSS tags in the promoter is the same. Importantly, the median value of TSS tags at gene end normalized to gene promoter is significantly higher than the median expression ratio of short DoG to host gene and of long DoG to host gene. Our results indicate that downstream overlapping long non-coding RNAs derived from the TSS at the gene end may be an important source of DoGs.
