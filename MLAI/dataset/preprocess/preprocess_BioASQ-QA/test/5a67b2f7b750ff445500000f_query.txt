Which type of urinary incontinence is diagnosed with the Q tip test?

[PMID: 3056562]
Thirty-two female patients with clinical and urodynamic findings of genuine stress urinary incontinence were evaluated before and 6 months after surgery for stress urinary incontinence. Twenty-nine control patients had identical evaluations before and 6 months after surgery which did not involve the urethrovesical junction. Twenty-four patients with primary bladder instability had similar evaluations and served as a second control group. Anatomical landmarks indicating support to the urethrovesical junction were evaluated by the position of the urethra at the most dependent point in the bladder on straining and the urethral descent on straining to beneath the posterior ramus of the symphysis pubis on bead chain cystography. The urethrovesical junction drop on straining was evaluated by transrectal ultrasonography. Cystographic and ultrasonographic tests for the position of the urethrovesical junction at the most dependent position in the bladder during straining were very sensitive in women with stress urinary incontinence (94 and 87% respectively) but much less specific (45 and 48% respectively). When evaluating anatomical support to the urethrovesical junction and its descent on straining, these tests were both highly sensitive (97 and 94% respectively) and specific (76 and 96% respectively) in women with genuine stress urinary incontinence. Simple clinical tests for support of the urethrovesical junction, such as the Q tip test, are non-specific in patients with stress urinary incontinence. Transrectal ultrasonography is a simple and quick out-patient procedure. The availability of ultrasound equipment in most clinics and the high sensitivity and specificity of the test make it an attractive and cost-effective alternative to X-ray cystography in the pre-operative evaluation of anatomical support to the urethrovesical junction.

To clarify the association between clinically defined simple stress urinary incontinence (SUI) symptoms and urodynamic SUI, we examined the relationship between Valsalva leak point pressure (VLPP) as measured by the Q-tip test and Stamey grade in simple female SUI. Two hundred grade I or II female SUI patients with SUI symptom were examined by reviewing medical history; physical examination; urethral mobility as assessed by Q-tip test; stress test; and cystometry, including VLPP measurement. On the basis of the VLPP, patients were classified into urethral hypermobility [UH, subdivided into anatomical incontinence (AI) and equivocal incontinence (EI)] or intrinsic sphincter deficiency groups for analysis of the relationship between VLPP and Stamey grade and Q-tip angle. Seventy-eight patients were included, and the mean patient age was 54 ± 7.5 years, mean SUI symptom duration 2.8 years (range 0.5-6 years), mean VLPP 103.6 ± 18.4 cm H2O, and mean Q-tip angle 28.6° ± 7.2°. Fifty-three patients were categorized as Stamey grade I, 25 as Stamey grade II, 51 as AI, and 27 as EI. VLPP was found to be negatively correlated with Q-tip angle (Rs = -0.798, Y = -0.313X + 60.95, P < 0.001), and classifications of VLPP and Stamey grade have positive correlation (χ (2) = 4.9130, P = 0.0267). In simple female SUI, VLPP is associated with the Q-tip angle and Stamey grade, which may help to reduce some of urodynamic items.

To evaluate the impact of a more limited paraurethral dissection, avoidance of perforating the obturator membrane with scissors or guide, and a more medial trajectory of the trocar in positioning the TVT-O device on stress urinary incontinence cure rates. One hundred and ten patients were recruited for this randomized, single blind, multicenter, non-inferiority study, with a 1:1 ratio to undergo the traditional (n=55) or the modified (n=55) technique. Preoperatively, patients underwent POP-Q staging, Q-tip test, challenge stress test and urodynamics, and completed the I-QoL, PISQ-12, and PGI-S questionnaires. During the post-operative period, patients attributed a pain VAS score 1, 3, 6, 12 and 24h after the procedure and were followed up at 12 months, undergoing the same baseline evaluations. The primary outcome was the cure rate (absence of urine leaks at the challenge stress test or urodynamic testing) one year after the procedure. The primary outcome was evaluated using a non-inferiority test. No differences were observed in cure rates (traditional technique 92.3% vs. modified technique 88.8% and non-inferiority P<0.05) and in questionnaire scores between the two groups. Post-operative pain was significantly lower in the modified technique group at each time point assessed, with the exception of 12h post-operatively. No differences between the two groups were observed in the number of analgesic vials administered. The modified technique does not seem to reduce the efficacy of TVT-O, but induces a reduction of post-operative pain.

Fifteen women with a clinical and urodynamic diagnosis of stress urinary incontinence had a negative Q-tip test (greater than or equal to 30 degrees Q-tip angle change on straining). All 15 had retropubic surgical procedures for stress incontinence in the form of a revised Pereyra procedure (n = 6) or Burch retropubic urethropexy (n = 9). Five of the nine patients undergoing the Burch procedure (55%) and three of the six undergoing the Peyreya procedure (50%) failed the procedure, for an overall failure rate of 53%. This rate was five times higher than that among women with stress urinary incontinence and a positive Q-tip test who underwent the same procedures (P less than .01). We conclude that women with stress urinary incontinence and no anatomic defect in the support of the urethrovesical junction should not undergo retropubic procedures because of their high failure rate. Other occlusive procedures, such as sling operations, should be considered for this group.

The Q-tip test was applied on 105 patients. Fifty-one had stress urinary incontinency (SUI), 28 had bladder instability by clinical and urodynamic criteria, and 36 had mild or moderate pelvic relaxation without urinary pathology. More than 90% of the patients with SUI and no previous surgery had a positive Q-tip test, with 90% test sensitivity in this group. More than one-third of the patients with bladder instability and almost one-half of the patients with pelvic relaxation and no urinary incontinence had a positive Q-tip test, for low test specificity. The Q-tip test is a simple clinical tool for diagnosing pelvic relaxation, which at times leads to SUI. Almost all patients with primary SUI have pelvic relaxation. The Q-tip test alone does not stand as a diagnostic test. When it is positive, the diagnosis of genuine stress incontinence is possible although not absolute. A negative test should cause one to question the diagnosis of genuine stress incontinence, and sophisticated and more expensive tests should be ordered before establishing a final diagnosis.

To assess the effectiveness of inside-out TVT-ABBREVO in the surgical treatment of female stress urinary incontinence (SUI) with mean two-year follow-up. Fifty-six women underwent surgery for moderate-severe SUI. The technology used was the TVT-ABBREVO inside-out. Each woman at 12 and 24 months underwent postoperative evaluation by means of urodynamics, Q-tip test, CST, transperineal ultrasonography, and administration of "King's Health Questionnaire" (KHQ). The mean age of the women was 57.03 +/- 11.1 years (range 42-75). Postoperative urodynamics (12 months follow-up) resulted to be normal in 43/56 patients (76.79%), in 10/56 (17.86%) cases resulted in a considerable improvement of the symptomatology, and only 1/56 (1.78%) case had de novo overactive bladder (OAB), in 2/56 (3.57%) symptomatology unchanged. After administration of the KHQ 43/56 cases (76.79%) had resolution of the symptomatology, 10/56 cases (17.86%) improvement of the symptomatology, and no change in 3/56 cases (5.36%). In the authors' experience, the TVT-ABBREVO resulted technically simple. The TVT-ABBREVO procedure provides high objective and subjective long-term efficacy, a clinically meaningful improvement in patient quality of life, and an excellent safety profile.

To compare the outcome of outside-in biological and synthetic transobturator tape (TOT) operation, including subjective and objective success rates, urodynamics, and quality of life. One hundred patients suffering from clinical and/or urodynamic stress urinary incontinence (SUI) were randomized into biological material TOT (PELVILACE® TO) or synthetic material TOT (ALIGN®TO Urethral Support System) groups. Preoperative and at 1 year postoperative urogynecological symptom assessment, 1-h pad test, 4-day bladder diary, stress test, Q-tip test, and urodynamics were performed. For the evaluation of quality of life, the King's Health Questionnaire, Urogenital Distress Inventory-6, Incontinence Impact Questionnaire-7, and Prolapse Quality of Life were used. There was no significant difference between the two groups regarding objective and subjective cure rates and quality of life. At 1-year follow-up, the subjective cure rate was 68 % in the biological material TOT and 70 % in the synthetic material TOT group. No perioperative complications developed. Groin pain developed in 2 patients in the biological TOT group and 1 patient had dehiscence in the periurethral incision, which healed with local estrogen. Two patients had transient urinary retention in the synthetic TOT group, 1 patient developed groin pain, and 1 patient had mesh erosion observed at the 1-year follow-up. Transobturator tape with biological material in the management of SUI has a rate of success and patient satisfaction similar to those of synthetic material at 1-year follow-up. Studies with longer follow-up and larger cohorts are necessary to evaluate possible autolysis and degradation of biological slings and a possible reduction in efficacy over time.

To compare the change of urethral mobility after midurethral sling procedures in stress urinary incontinence with hypermobile urethra and assess these findings with surgical outcomes. 141 women who agreed to undergo midurethral sling operations due to stress urinary incontinence with hypermobile urethra were enrolled in this non-randomized prospective observational study. Preoperatively, urethral mobility was measured by Q tip test. All women were asked to complete Urogenital Distress Inventory Short Form (UDI-6) and Incontinence Impact Questionnaire Short Form (IIQ-7) to assess the quality of life. Six months postoperatively, Q tip test and quality of life assessment were repeated. The primary surgical outcomes were classified as cure, improvement and failure. Transient urinary obstruction, de novo urgency, voiding dysfunction were secondary surgical outcomes. Of 141 women, 50 (35. 5%) women underwent TOT, 91 (64.5%) underwent TVT. In both TOT and TVT groups, postoperative Q tip test values, IIQ-7 and UDI-6 scores were statistically reduced when compared with preoperative values. Postoperative Q tip test value in TVT group was significantly smaller than in TOT group [25°(15-45°) and 20° (15-45°), respectively]. When we compared the Q-tip test value, IIQ-7 and UDI-6 scores changes, there were no statistically significant changes between the groups. Postoperative urethral mobility was more frequent in TOT group than in TVT group (40% vs 23.1%, respectively). Postoperative primary and secondary outcomes were similar in both groups. Although midurethral slings decrease the urethtal hypermobility, postoperative mobility status of urethra does not effect surgical outcomes of midurethral slings in women with preoperative urethral hypermobility.

The aim of the study was to exclude neurovascular damage due to prosthetic mini-invasive surgery using transobturator tape (TOT) by pre- and postoperative electromyography (EMG) of the striated urethral sphincter and a color Doppler ultrasonography evaluation of clitoral blood flow. A total of 25 women affected by clinical stress urinary incontinence (SUI) were enrolled. After undergoing urodynamic assessment, pelvic organ prolapse quantification, urine culture, Q-tip test, and stress test, each subject underwent color Doppler ultrasonography to record clitoral blood flow and EMG of the urethral sphincter with a needle electrode inserted through the mucosa into the muscle tissue before surgery. A single urogynecologist performed the TOT surgical technique for the treatment of all patients. Urogynecologic examination, EMG, and color Doppler ultrasound follow-up were performed at 1 and 6 months after surgery. At the urogynecologic examination performed 1 and 6 months after the TOT approach the stress test was negative, urethral hypermobility was reduced, and sling exposure was not observed for each patient. There was no statistically significant difference in electromyographic values (p > 0.05) in both the follow-ups with regard to baseline values. Pulsatility index (PI), resistance index (RI), and peak systolic velocity (PSV) values increased during the first follow-up (p < 0.01); PI and RI values increased during the second follow-up with respect to baseline values (p < 0.01) TOT prosthesis surgery, avoiding denervation and devascularization of pelvic structures, does not damage the urethral sphincter.
