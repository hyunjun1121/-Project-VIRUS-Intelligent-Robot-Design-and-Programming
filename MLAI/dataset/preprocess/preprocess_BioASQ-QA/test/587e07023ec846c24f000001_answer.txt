IDEAL_ANSWER:
- PHYLUCE is a software package for the analysis of conserved genomic loci. It identifies targeted, enriched loci from the off-target background data; aligns enriched contigs representing conserved loci to one another; and prepare and manipulate these alignments for subsequent phylogenomic inference. PHYLUCE is an efficient and easy-to-install software package that accomplishes these tasks across hundreds of taxa and thousands of enriched loci
