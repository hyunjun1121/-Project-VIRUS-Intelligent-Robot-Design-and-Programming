Which is the phenotype of the disease fibrodysplasia ossificans progressiva?

[PMID: 29033382]
Fibrodysplasia ossificans progressiva (FOP) is an ultra-rare genetic disorder in which heterotopic bone forms in the soft tissues. This often occurs in response to injury or inflammation, leading to joint immobilization and significant disability. There are currently no definitive treatment options for this devastating disease. Although the most dramatic phenotype in FOP is the episodic and progressive heterotopic ossification, patients report a number of symptoms that affect other organ systems. Post-mortem examination of FOP patients may contribute to our understanding of the underlying pathophysiology and complications of this disease. Here, we present the autopsy findings from three patients with FOP. Autopsy findings in two of the three patients confirmed that the cause of death was cardiorespiratory failure in the setting of severe thoracic insufficiency from heterotopic ossification. Both of these patients also had evidence of right ventricular dilatation likely secondary to thoracic insufficiency. The third patient died from complications of a traumatic head injury after a fall but also had post-mortem evidence of thoracic insufficiency syndrome. All three patients had extensive, widespread heterotopic ossification and joint deformities consistent with FOP. There was extensive ossification of the spinal ligament in these patients, which may contribute to cervical spine rigidity. One patient was diagnosed post-mortem with a brainstem malformation. No additional significant abnormalities were noted in the other organ systems. Finally, we also demonstrate that cadaveric skin fibroblasts can be isolated for use as a potential source for future in vitro cell culture studies. This autopsy case series provides valuable information about the underlying complications of FOP and contributes significantly to our knowledge of this rare yet debilitating disorder. Thoracic insufficiency syndrome, right heart dysfunction, widespread heterotopic ossification, spinal ligament ossification, and CNS malformations were clearly evident; however, most other non-bone tissues appeared to be spared from gross malformations. Finally, the ability to isolate live cells from cadaveric skin is an important technique that will facilitate future studies, particularly as induced pluripotent stem cells and other cell-based technologies evolve. This case series highlights the importance of post-mortem examinations and their contribution to our current knowledge of disease pathophysiology and comorbidities.

Metaphyseal bony outgrowths are a well-recognized feature of fibrodysplasia ossificans progressiva (FOP) phenotype, but its genuine frequency, topographic distribution, morphological aspect, and potential implications are not fully established. To better ascertain the frequency and characteristics of osteocartilaginous exostoses in FOP disease, we conducted a cross-sectional radiological study based on all the traceable cases identified in a previous comprehensive national research. Metaphyseal exostoses were present in all the 17 cases of FOP studied. Although most often arising from the distal femoral (where metaphyseal exostoses adopt a peculiar not yet reported appearance) and proximal tibial bones, we have found that they are not restricted to these areas, but rather can be seen scattered at a variety of other skeletal sites. Using nuclear magnetic resonance imaging, we show that these exophytic outgrowths are true osteochondromas. As a whole, these results are in agreement with data coming from the literature review. Our study confirms the presence of metaphyseal osteochondromas as a very frequent trait of FOP phenotype and an outstanding feature of its anomalous skeletal developmental component. In line with recent evidences, this might imply that dysregulation of BMP signaling, in addition to promoting exuberant heterotopic ossification, could induce aberrant chondrogenesis and osteochondroma formation. Unveiling the molecular links between these physiopathological pathways could help to illuminate the mechanisms that govern bone morphogenesis.

Fibrodysplasia ossificans progressiva (FOP), a congenital heterotopic ossification (HO) syndrome caused by gain-of-function mutations of bone morphogenetic protein (BMP) type I receptor ACVR1, manifests with progressive ossification of skeletal muscles, tendons, ligaments, and joints. In this disease, HO can occur in discrete flares, often triggered by injury or inflammation, or may progress incrementally without identified triggers. Mice harboring an Acvr1<sup>R206H</sup> knock-in allele recapitulate the phenotypic spectrum of FOP, including injury-responsive intramuscular HO and spontaneous articular, tendon, and ligament ossification. The cells that drive HO in these diverse tissues can be compartmentalized into two lineages: an Scx<sup>+</sup> tendon-derived progenitor that mediates endochondral HO of ligaments and joints without exogenous injury, and a muscle-resident interstitial Mx1<sup>+</sup> population that mediates intramuscular, injury-dependent endochondral HO. Expression of Acvr1<sup>R206H</sup> in either lineage confers aberrant gain of BMP signaling and chondrogenic differentiation in response to activin A and gives rise to mutation-expressing hypertrophic chondrocytes in HO lesions. Compared to Acvr1<sup>R206H</sup>, expression of the man-made, ligand-independent ACVR1<sup>Q207D</sup> mutation accelerates and increases the penetrance of all observed phenotypes, but does not abrogate the need for antecedent injury in muscle HO, demonstrating the need for an injury factor in addition to enhanced BMP signaling. Both injury-dependent intramuscular and spontaneous ligament HO in Acvr1<sup>R206H</sup> knock-in mice were effectively controlled by the selective ACVR1 inhibitor LDN-212854. Thus, diverse phenotypes of HO found in FOP are rooted in cell-autonomous effects of dysregulated ACVR1 signaling in nonoverlapping tissue-resident progenitor pools that may be addressed by systemic therapy or by modulating injury-mediated factors involved in their local recruitment.
