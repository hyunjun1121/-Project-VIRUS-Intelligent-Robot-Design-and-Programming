What causes Bathing suit Ichthyosis(BSI)?

[PMID: 22801880]
Bathing suit ichthyosis (BSI) and self-improving collodion ichthyosis (SICI) are 2 minor variants of generalized autosomal recessive congenital ichthyosis. Bathing suit ichthyosis is characterized by scaling of the skin in a bathing suit pattern, mainly limited to the trunk, whereas SICI is characterized by complete disappearance of the skin lesions. We report genotypic and phenotypic data from a series of 9 patients who were collodion babies and developed BSI or SICI owing to mutations in the transglutaminase-1 gene (TGM1), including 3 previously unreported missense mutations. All of our patients with BSI or SICI carried at least 1 specific missense mutation in TGM1 concerning an arginine at position 307 or 315. In 2 patients, the disease evolved (BSI to SICI or BSI to autosomal recessive congenital ichthyosis). The remaining 7 patients exhibited a stable BSI phenotype after shedding of the collodion membrane. This study highlights the possibility of variable evolution of the phenotype of patients with identical mutations in the same gene. Combined with data from the literature, these findings confirm the hypothesis that only a restricted spectrum of TGM1 mutations leads to a BSI and/or an SICI phenotype. This phenotypic variability also depends on other genetic and external factors.

Bathing suit ichthyosis (BSI) is a rare congenital disorder of keratinization characterized by restriction of scale to sites of relatively higher temperature such as the trunk, with cooler areas remaining unaffected. Fewer than 40 cases have been reported in the literature. Bathing suit ichthyosis is caused by recessive, temperature-sensitive mutations in the transglutaminase-1 gene (TGM1). Clear genotype-phenotype correlations have been difficult to establish because several of the same TGM1 mutations have been reported in BSI and other forms of congenital ichthyosis. We identify novel and recurrent mutations in 16 participants with BSI. To expand the genotypic spectrum of BSI, identifying novel TGM1 mutations in patients with BSI, and to use BSI genotypes to draw inferences about the temperature sensitivity of TGM1 mutations. A total of 16 participants with BSI from 13 kindreds were identified from 6 academic medical centers. A detailed clinical history was obtained from each participant, including phenotypic presentation at birth and disease course. Each participant underwent targeted sequencing of TGM1. Phenotypic and genotypic characteristics in these patients from birth onward. Of the 16 participants, 7 were male, and 9 were female (mean age, 12.6 years; range, 1-39 years). We found 1 novel TGM1 indel mutation (Ile469_Cys471delinsMetLeu) and 8 TGM1 missense mutations that to our knowledge have not been previously reported in BSI: 5 have been previously described in non-temperature-sensitive forms of congenital ichthyosis (Arg143Cys, Gly218Ser, Gly278Arg, Arg286Gln, and Ser358Arg), and 3 (Tyr374Cys, Phe495Leu, and Ser772Arg) are novel mutations. Three probands were homozygous for Arg264Trp, Arg286Gln, or Arg315Leu, indicating that these mutations are temperature sensitive. Seven of 10 probands with a compound heterozygous TGM1 genotype had a mutation at either arginine 307 or 315, providing evidence that mutations at these sites are temperature sensitive and highlighting the importance of these residues in the pathogenesis of BSI. Our findings expand the genotypic spectrum of BSI and the understanding of temperature sensitivity of TGM1 mutations. Increased awareness of temperature-sensitive TGM1 genotypes should aid in genetic counseling and provide insights into the pathophysiology of TGM1 ichthyoses, transglutaminase-1 enzymatic activity, and potential therapeutic approaches.

Bathing suit ichthyosis (BSI) is an uncommon phenotype classified as a minor variant of autosomal recessive congenital ichthyosis (ARCI). We report a case of BSI in a 3-year-old Tunisian girl with a novel mutation of the transglutaminase 1 gene (TGM1). This infant had been born with a collodion membrane encasing her entire body. From the age of three months, brownish scaling was noted on the bathing suit area. Histology showed orthohyperkeratosis with acanthosis of the epidermis. The granular layer was normal, and the superficial dermis was mildly inflammatory, confirming a diagnosis of proliferating ichthyosis. Molecular analysis in the patient and her parents revealed the mutation I304F of TGM1. Treatment with emollients and keratolytics partially improved the patient's skin condition. Bathing suit ichthyosis is an uncommon phenotype unique in its topography, which involves the trunk but spares the face and extremities. Previous studies using molecular analysis have shown that BSI is caused mainly by mutations in TGM1. Twenty missense mutations have been reported in BSI. Of these 20 missense mutations, nine occurred only in patients with the BSI phenotype and 11 were common to BSI and other types of ARCI. Until recently, there has been no genotype-phenotype correlation. Therefore, the same mutation of the transglutaminase 1 could result in either generalized ARCI or BSI. The present case demonstrates this phenotype in a White Tunisian patient with a novel mutation of TGM1 (I304F) not previously reported in BSI.

Bathing suit ichthyosis (BSI) is a striking and unique clinical form of autosomal recessive congenital ichthyosis characterized by pronounced scaling on the bathing suit areas but sparing of the extremities and the central face. Here we report on a series of 10 BSI patients. Our genetic, ultrastructural and biochemical investigations show that BSI is caused by transglutaminase-1 (TGase-1) deficiency. Altogether, we identified 13 mutations in TGM1-among them seven novel missense mutations and one novel nonsense mutation. Structural modeling for the Tyr276Asn mutation reveals that the residue is buried in the hydrophobic interior of the enzyme and that the hydroxyl side chain of Tyr276 is exposed to solvent in a cavity of the enzyme. Cryosections of healthy skin areas demonstrated an almost normal TGase activity, in contrast to the affected BSI skin, which only showed a cytoplasmic and clearly reduced TGase-1 activity. The distribution of TGase-1 substrates in the epidermis of affected skin corresponded to the situation in TGase-1 deficiency. Interestingly, the expression of TGase-3 and cathepsin D was reduced. Digital thermography validated a striking correlation between warmer body areas and presence of scaling in patients suggesting a decisive influence of the skin temperature. In situ TGase testing in skin of BSI patients demonstrated a marked decrease of enzyme activity when the temperature was increased from 25 to 37 degrees C. We conclude that BSI is caused by TGase-1 deficiency and suggest that it is a temperature-sensitive phenotype.

Bathing suit ichthyosis (BSI) is a rare variant of autosomal recessive lamellar ichthyosis due to transglutaminase-1 (TGase-1) gene mutations leading to a temperature sensitive phenotype. It is characterized by dark-grey or brownish scaling restricted to the 'bathing suit' areas, whereas the extremities and central face are almost completely spared. We report a 2-year-old African girl with BSI with ultrastructural and biochemical demonstration of TGase-1 deficiency over the affected skin. TGase-1 gene analysis disclosed the homozygous p.R315L mutation, which may lead to a temperature sensitive dysfunction of the enzyme.
