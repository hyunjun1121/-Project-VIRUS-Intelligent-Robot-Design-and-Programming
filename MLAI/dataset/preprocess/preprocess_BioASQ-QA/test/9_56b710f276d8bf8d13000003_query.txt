What is the effect of a defective CLN3 gene?

[PMID: 10332042]
Batten disease [juvenile-onset neuronal ceroid lipofuscinosis (JNCL)], the most common progressive encephalopathy of childhood, is caused by mutations in a novel lysosomal membrane protein (CLN3) with unknown function. In this study, we have confirmed the lysosomal localization of the CLN3 protein by immunoelectron microscopy by co-localizing it with soluble and membrane-associated lysosomal proteins. We have analysed the intracellular processing and localization of two mutants, 461-677del, which is present in 85% of CLN3 alleles and causes the classical JNCL, and E295K [corrected], which is a rare missense mutation associated with an atypical form of JNCL. Pulse-chase labelling and immunoprecipitation of the two mutant proteins in COS-1-cells indicated that 461-677del is synthesized as an approximately 24 kDa truncated polypeptide, whereas the maturation of E295K [corrected] resembles that of the wild-type CLN3 polypeptide. Transient expression of the two mutants in BHK cells showed that 461-677del is retained in the endoplasmic reticulum, whereas E295K [corrected] was capable of reaching the lysosomal compartment. The CLN3 polypeptides were expressed further in mouse primary neurons where the wild-type CLN3 protein was localized both in the cell soma and in neuronal extensions, whereas the 461-677del mutant was arrested in the cell soma. Interestingly, co-localization of the wild-type CLN3 and E295K [corrected] proteins with a synaptic vesicle marker indicates that the CLN3 protein might participate in synaptic vesicle transport/transmission. The data presented here provide clear evidence for a cellular distinction between classical and atypical forms of Batten disease both in neural and non-neural cells.

Mutations in the CLN3 gene, which encodes a lysosomal membrane protein, are responsible for the neurodegenerative disorder juvenile Batten disease. A previous study on the yeast homolog to CLN3, designated Btn1p, revealed a potential role for CLN3 in the transport of arginine into the yeast vacuole, the equivalent organelle to the mammalian lysosome. Lysosomes isolated from lymphoblast cell lines, established from individuals with juvenile Batten disease-bearing mutations in CLN3, but not age-matched controls, demonstrate defective transport of arginine. Furthermore, we show that there is a depletion of arginine in cells derived from individuals with juvenile Batten disease. We have, therefore, characterized lysosomal arginine transport in normal lysosomes and show that it is ATP-, v-ATPase- and cationic-dependent. This and previous studies have shown that both arginine and lysine are transported by the same transport system, designated system c. However, we report that lysosomes isolated from juvenile Batten disease lymphoblasts are only defective for arginine transport. These results suggest that the CLN3 defect in juvenile Batten disease may affect how intracellular levels of arginine are regulated or distributed throughout the cell. This assertion is supported by two other experimental approaches. First, an antibody to CLN3 can block lysosomal arginine transport and second, expression of CLN3 in JNCL cells using a lentiviral vector can restore lysosomal arginine transport. CLN3 may have a role in regulating intracellular levels of arginine possibly through control of the transport of this amino acid into lysosomes.

Juvenile neuronal ceroid lipofuscinosis (Batten disease) is a neurodegenerative disorder caused by defective function of the lysosomal membrane glycoprotein CLN3. The activity of the lysosomal acid phosphatase (LAP/ACP2) was found to be significantly increased in the cerebellum and brain stem of Cln3-targeted mice during the early stages of postnatal life. Histochemical localization studies revealed an increased LAP/ACP2 staining intensity in neurons of the cerebral cortex of 48-week-old Cln3-targeted mice as compared with controls. Additionally, the expression of another lysosomal membrane protein LAMP-2 was increased in all brain areas. Knockdown of CLN3 expression in HeLa cells by RNA interference also resulted in increased LAP/ACP2 and LAMP-2 expression. Finally in fibroblasts of two juvenile neuronal ceroid lipofuscinosis patients elevated levels of LAP/ACP2 were found. Both activation of gene transcription and increased protein half-life appear to contribute to increased LAP/ACP2 protein expression in CLN3-deficient cells. The data suggest that lysosomal dysfunction and accumulation of storage material require increased biogenesis of LAP/ACP2 and LAMP-2 positive membranes which makes LAP/ACP2 suitable as biomarker of Batten disease.

The vacuolar H(+)-ATPase (V-ATPase) along with ion channels and transporters maintains vacuolar pH. V-ATPase ATP hydrolysis is coupled with proton transport and establishes an electrochemical gradient between the cytosol and vacuolar lumen for coupled transport of metabolites. Btn1p, the yeast homolog to human CLN3 that is defective in Batten disease, localizes to the vacuole. We previously reported that Btn1p is required for vacuolar pH maintenance and ATP-dependent vacuolar arginine transport. We report that extracellular pH alters both V-ATPase activity and proton transport into the vacuole of wild-type Saccharomyces cerevisiae. V-ATPase activity is modulated through the assembly and disassembly of the V(0) and V(1) V-ATPase subunits located in the vacuolar membrane and on the cytosolic side of the vacuolar membrane, respectively. V-ATPase assembly is increased in yeast cells grown in high extracellular pH. In addition, at elevated extracellular pH, S. cerevisiae lacking BTN1 (btn1-Delta), have decreased V-ATPase activity while proton transport into the vacuole remains similar to that for wild type. Thus, coupling of V-ATPase activity and proton transport in btn1-Delta is altered. We show that down-regulation of V-ATPase activity compensates the vacuolar pH imbalance for btn1-Delta at early growth phases. We therefore propose that Btn1p is required for tight regulation of vacuolar pH to maintain the vacuolar luminal content and optimal activity of this organelle and that disruption in Btn1p function leads to a modulation of V-ATPase activity to maintain cellular pH homeostasis and vacuolar luminal content.

During brain development, excess neurons that are formed die by apoptosis. cln3 was recently identified as the gene defective in juvenile Batten disease, an inherited neurodegenerative disease of childhood. In this disease, neurons die by apoptosis. Overexpression of this gene increases survival of human NT2 neuronal precursor cells. We, therefore, hypothesized that cln3 may be present in developing neurons and may play an important role in regulating the developmental process. NT2 neuronal cells were induced to develop into mature neurons. We evaluated cln3 expression by reverse transcription PCR and immunohistochemistry over a 7-wk period of differentiation. Also, cln3 expression was characterized in neonatal rat brain during the first week of life (P-1, P0, P4, and P8) and at P30. cln3 was differentially expressed during neuronal development into nondividing post-mitotic neurons. The greatest expression was noted during wk 6 and then dropped to predifferentiation levels during wk 7. cln3 expression was detected in all the rat brain developmental stages evaluated. The greatest expression was seen at P0 and was double compared with the other stages. We conclude that cln3 is present during critical periods of neuronal cell differentiation and brain development. As cln3 is antiapoptotic, we hypothesize that cln3 plays an important role in regulating brain development. These findings may have implications for identifying strategies aimed at neuroprotection and neuronal survival during development.

Juvenile neuronal ceroid-lipofuscinosis (JNCL) or Batten/Spielmeyer-Vogt-Sjogren disease (OMIM #204200) is one of a group of nine clinically related inherited neurodegenerative disorders (CLN1-9). JNCL results from mutations in CLN3 on chromosome 16p12.1. The neuronal loss in Batten disease has been shown to be due to a combination of apoptosis and autophagy suggesting that CLN3P, the defective protein, may have an anti-neuronal death function. PANDER (PANcreatic-DERived factor) is a novel cytokine that was recently cloned from pancreatic islet cells. PANDER is specifically expressed in the pancreatic islets, small intestine, testis, prostate, and neurons of the central nervous system, and has been demonstrated to induce apoptosis. In this study, we over-expressed CLN3P in SH-SY5Y neuroblastoma cells and monitored the effects on PANDER-induced apoptosis. CLN3P significantly increased the survival rate of the SH-SY5Y cells in this system. This study provides additional evidence that the function of CLN3P is related to preventing neuronal apoptosis.

The endosomal/lysosomal transmembrane protein CLN3 is mutated in the Batten disease (juvenile neuronal ceroid lipofuscinosis, JNCL). However, the molecular mechanism of JNCL pathogenesis and the exact function of the CLN3 protein have remained unclear. Previous studies have shown that deletion of BTN1, the yeast orthologue of CLN3, leads to increased expression of BTN2. BTN2 encodes Btn2p, a proposed homologue to a novel microtubule-binding protein Hook1, which regulates endocytosis in Drosophila. We analysed here the putative interconnection between CLN3 and Hook1 in the mammalian cells and discovered that overexpression of human CLN3 induces aggregation of Hook1 protein, potentially by mediating its dissociation from the microtubules. Using in vitro binding assay we were able to demonstrate a weak interaction between Hook1 and the cytoplasmic segments of CLN3. We also found receptor-mediated endocytosis to be defective in CLN3-deficient JNCL fibroblasts, connecting CLN3, Hook1 and endocytosis in the mammalian system. Moreover, co-immunoprecipitation experiments showed that Hook1 physically interacts with endocytic Rab7, Rab9 and Rab11, hence delineating a manifold role for mammalian Hook1 in membrane trafficking events. These novel interactions between the microtubule-binding Hook1 and the large family of Rab GTPases also suggest a link between CLN3 function, microtubule cytoskeleton and endocytic membrane trafficking.

Batten disease (juvenile-onset neuronal ceroid lipofuscinosis, JNCL), the most common neurodegenerative disorder of childhood, is caused by mutations in a recently identified gene ( CLN3 ) localized to chromosome 16p11.2-12.1. To elucidate the biosynthesis and localization of the CLN3 protein, we expressed CLN3 cDNA in COS-1 and HeLa cell lines. In vitro translation, immunoprecipitation and Western blotting analyses detected an approximately 43 kDa polypeptide. Pulse-chase experiments indicated that the CLN3 protein is synthesized as an N -glycosylated single-chain polypeptide, which was not detected in growth medium. Confocal immunofluorescence microscopy revealed that the CLN3 protein is localized to the lysosomal compartment. These results provide evidence that Batten disease can be classified as a member of lysosomal diseases.

1. In order to investigate the biological function of the human CLN3 gene that is defective in Batten disease, we created a yeast strain by PCR-targeted disruption of the yeast gene (YHC3), which is a homologue of the human CLN3 gene. 2. The phenotypic characterization revealed that the yhc3 delta mutants are more sensitive to combined heat and alkaline stress than the wild-type strains as determined by inhibition of cell proliferation. 3. This suggests that the yhc3 delta mutant is a good model to investigate the biological function of human CLN3 gene in mammalian cells and to understand the pathophysiology of juvenile Batten disease.
