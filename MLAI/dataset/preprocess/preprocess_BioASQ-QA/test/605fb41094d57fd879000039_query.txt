What is caused by a gain-of-function mutation in CLCN2?

[PMID: 29403011]
Primary aldosteronism, a common cause of severe hypertension <sup>1</sup> , features constitutive production of the adrenal steroid aldosterone. We analyzed a multiplex family with familial hyperaldosteronism type II (FH-II) <sup>2</sup> and 80 additional probands with unsolved early-onset primary aldosteronism. Eight probands had novel heterozygous variants in CLCN2, including two de novo mutations and four independent occurrences of a mutation encoding an identical p.Arg172Gln substitution; all relatives with early-onset primary aldosteronism carried the CLCN2 variant found in the proband. CLCN2 encodes a voltage-gated chloride channel expressed in adrenal glomerulosa that opens at hyperpolarized membrane potentials. Channel opening depolarizes glomerulosa cells and induces expression of aldosterone synthase, the rate-limiting enzyme for aldosterone biosynthesis. Mutant channels show gain of function, with higher open probabilities at the glomerulosa resting potential. These findings for the first time demonstrate a role of anion channels in glomerulosa membrane potential determination, aldosterone production and hypertension. They establish the cause of a substantial fraction of early-onset primary aldosteronism.

Primary aldosteronism is the most common and curable form of secondary arterial hypertension. We performed whole-exome sequencing in patients with early-onset primary aldosteronism and identified a de novo heterozygous c.71G>A/p.Gly24Asp mutation in the CLCN2 gene, encoding the voltage-gated ClC-2 chloride channel <sup>1</sup> , in a patient diagnosed at 9 years of age. Patch-clamp analysis of glomerulosa cells of mouse adrenal gland slices showed hyperpolarization-activated Cl<sup>-</sup> currents that were abolished in Clcn2<sup>-/-</sup> mice. The p.Gly24Asp variant, located in a well-conserved 'inactivation domain'<sup>2,3</sup>, abolished the voltage- and time-dependent gating of ClC-2 and strongly increased Cl<sup>-</sup> conductance at resting potentials. Expression of ClC-2<sup>Asp24</sup> in adrenocortical cells increased expression of aldosterone synthase and aldosterone production. Our data indicate that CLCN2 mutations cause primary aldosteronism. They highlight the important role of chloride in aldosterone biosynthesis and identify ClC-2 as the foremost chloride conductor of resting glomerulosa cells.
