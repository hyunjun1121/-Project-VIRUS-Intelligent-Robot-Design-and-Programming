What disease is small bowel lymphoma commonly associated with

A 62-yr-old man presented with a 5-yr history of intermittent abdominal distention and pain. These symptoms persisted for several months and subsided without treatment. A diagnosis of suspected small bowel lymphoma was made based on plain radiograph and computerized tomogram findings, and he was referred to our institution for further evaluation. Segmental resection of the small intestine was performed and the diagnosis of marginal zone B-cell lymphoma associated with amyloidosis was made. This is the first case of marginal zone B-cell lymphoma of mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue (MALT) in the small intestine associated with amyloidosis in Korea.

Celiac disease is an autoimmune disorder triggered by ingestion of gluten-containing foods. Epidemiologic studies dating from the 1950s established its association with gastrointestinal malignancies, particularly small bowel lymphoma. Corrao et al. recently demonstrated that patients with celiac disease are at increased risk of mortality. Further, this risk is directly related to compliance with a gluten-free diet. Continued research is needed regarding the development of malignant complications related to celiac disease.

An increased incidence of small bowel lymphoma in patients with long-standing celiac sprue is well documented in the literature. Less common is the association of adenocarcinoma of the small intestine. We report a patient with celiac sprue who initially responded to a gluten-free diet. Eighteen months later, diarrhea, abdominal cramps, and bloating was found to have its origin in partial small bowel obstruction. At laparotomy, two distinct adenocarcinomas of the jejunum were resected. Celiac patients who initially respond to gluten withdrawal and subsequently suffer exacerbation while adhering to strict dietary therapy should be carefully evaluated for evidence of a small bowel malignancy.

'Flat and flexible truths are beat out by every hammer' (Sir Thomas Browne, writer and physician) The prevalence of gluten-sensitive enteropathy (GSE) or coeliac disease is likely to be as high as 1:200 to 1:400 in the developed world. Current medical practice leaves a significant proportion of these cases undiagnosed. An association between untreated coeliac disease and intestinal malignancy is well described so it is possible that patients with undiagnosed coeliac disease constitute a significant reservoir of preventable gastrointestinal malignancy. However, it is not clear whether all patients with coeliac disease are equally at risk of malignancy nor are all cases of intestinal malignancy necessarily associated with wheat protein sensitivity. Thus the precise links between GSE, villous atrophy and malignancy have not yet been established. However, there is evidence that products of activated T-cell clones, be they antigen specific or malignant, influence epithelial cell proliferation, differentiation and function thus contributing to the histological lesion characteristic of GSE or small bowel lymphoma.

The objective of our study was to evaluate the morphologic appearances of small-bowel lymphoma using MR enterography to identify key morphologic traits capable of providing an association between imaging manifestations and likely histologic diagnosis. Over a 54-month period, 10 patients with subsequently confirmed small-bowel lymphoma were imaged using a standardized MR enterography technique. Retrospective chart review was performed to detect associated disease processes, such as celiac disease. The morphologic characteristics of each segment with lymphomatous involvement were evaluated with respect to tumor location, tumor size, mural characteristics, fold features, loop dilatation, luminal stricturing, mesenteric or antimesenteric distribution, mesenteric involvement, and signal intensity. Nineteen distinct segments of lymphomatous involvement were identified in 10 patients, and underlying celiac disease was confirmed in six of the 10 patients. This patient group comprised 10 patients with non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (NHL) of various subtypes. No cases of Hodgkin's lymphoma were encountered. Analysis revealed celiac NHL enteropathy to have a tendency toward localization to a single, long (> 10 cm), smooth continuous bowel segment, often with aneurysmal loop dilatation, in the absence of a distinct mesenteric or antimesenteric distribution. Luminal stricturing was encountered in cases of low-grade lymphoma, whereas mesenteric fat infiltration represented a characteristic of high-grade disease. We describe the characteristics of small-bowel lymphoma on MR enterography, identifying a number of key features that may help the interpreting radiologist in suggesting the underlying histologic subtype and whether the presence of underlying celiac disease is likely.
