IDEAL_ANSWER:
- inhibited cell viability and migration
- While T cell growth in vitro, Satb1 knockdown was found to be effective in vivo by inhibiting T cell proliferation and activating apoptosis in a subset of T cells
- knock-out of Satb1 significantly inhibited cell viability and migration, and promoted Schwann cells apoptosis.
- SATB1 is essential for maintaining TCR responsiveness during the induction and effector phases and may provide a novel therapeutic target for T cell-mediated autoimmune diseases. knock-out of Satb1 significantly inhibited cell viability and migration, and promoted Schwann cells apoptosis.
- Knock-out of Satb1 significantly inhibited cell viability and migration, and promoted Schwann cells apoptosis.

EXACT_ANSWER:
- apoptosis
