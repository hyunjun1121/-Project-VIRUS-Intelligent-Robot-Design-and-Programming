[PMID: 7886456]
The human pathogen Helicobacter pylori is associated with gastritis, peptic ulcer disease, and gastric cancer. The pathogenesis of H. pylori infection in vivo was studied by adapting fresh clinical isolates of bacteria to colonize the stomachs of mice. A gastric pathology resembling human disease was observed in infections with cytotoxin-producing strains but not with noncytotoxic strains. Oral immunization with purified H. pylori antigens protected mice from bacterial infection. This mouse model will allow the development of therapeutic agents and vaccines against H. pylori infection in humans.

Strains of <i>Helicobacter pylori</i> that cause ulcer or gastric cancer typically express a type IV secretion system (T4SS) encoded by the <i>cag</i> pathogenicity island (<i>cag</i>PAI). CagY is an ortholog of VirB10 that, unlike other VirB10 orthologs, has a large middle repeat region (MRR) with extensive repetitive sequence motifs, which undergo CD4<sup>+</sup> T cell-dependent recombination during infection of mice. Recombination in the CagY MRR reduces T4SS function, diminishes the host inflammatory response, and enables the bacteria to colonize at a higher density. Since CagY is known to bind human α<sub>5</sub>β<sub>1</sub> integrin, we tested the hypothesis that recombination in the CagY MRR regulates T4SS function by modulating binding to α<sub>5</sub>β<sub>1</sub> integrin. Using a cell-free microfluidic assay, we found that <i>H. pylori</i> binding to α<sub>5</sub>β<sub>1</sub> integrin under shear flow is dependent on the CagY MRR, but independent of the presence of the T4SS pili, which are only formed when <i>H. pylori</i> is in contact with host cells. Similarly, expression of CagY in the absence of other T4SS genes was necessary and sufficient for whole bacterial cell binding to α<sub>5</sub>β<sub>1</sub> integrin. Bacteria with variant <i>cagY</i> alleles that reduced T4SS function showed comparable reduction in binding to α<sub>5</sub>β<sub>1</sub> integrin, although CagY was still expressed on the bacterial surface. We speculate that <i>cagY-</i>dependent modulation of <i>H. pylori</i> T4SS function is mediated by alterations in binding to α<sub>5</sub>β<sub>1</sub> integrin, which in turn regulates the host inflammatory response so as to maximize persistent infection.<b>IMPORTANCE</b> Infection with <i>H. pylori</i> can cause peptic ulcers and is the most important risk factor for gastric cancer, the third most common cause of cancer death worldwide. The major <i>H. pylori</i> virulence factor that determines whether infection causes disease or asymptomatic colonization is the type IV secretion system (T4SS), a sort of molecular syringe that injects bacterial products into gastric epithelial cells and alters host cell physiology. We previously showed that recombination in CagY, an essential T4SS component, modulates the function of the T4SS. Here we found that these recombination events produce parallel changes in specific binding to α<sub>5</sub>β<sub>1</sub> integrin, a host cell receptor that is essential for T4SS-dependent translocation of bacterial effectors. We propose that CagY-dependent binding to α<sub>5</sub>β<sub>1</sub> integrin acts like a molecular rheostat that alters T4SS function and modulates the host immune response to promote persistent infection.

Helicobacter Pylori (H. pylori) is a gram-negative bacteria infecting numerous people all over the world. It has been established that H. pylori play an important role in pathogenesis of gastritis, peptic ulcer and gastric cancer. Pathogenic features of this bacterium are mainly attributes to the existence of pathogenic islands (PAI) genes. The most known genes in these islands are cytotoxin-associated gene A (CagA) and vacuolating cytotoxin gene (VacA). Most studies demonstrated various frequency of CagA and VacA in patient with peptic ulcer or gastritis in different countries. This variation in CagA and VacA frequency may be due to the capability of this bacterium to be genetically versatile and can alter the expression of these genes with geographic diversity. Although H. pylori infection is not usually associated with any clinical symptoms, but sometimes leads to inflammation in gastrointestinal system and resulted in peptic ulcer and gastric cancer. In this regard, this review will illustrate the importance of Helicobacter pylori in pathogenesis of gastrointestinal disorders with focusing on CagA and VacA virulence factors.

Helicobacter pylori has been linked to chronic gastritis, peptic ulcers, gastric cancer and mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue lymphoma. Invasive tests are less sensitive than noninvasive tests in diagnosing H. pylori infection in patients with bleeding peptic ulcers. The H. pylori stool antigen test has been useful in diagnosing H. pylori in patients with peptic ulcers before and after eradication of H. pylori. The aim of this study was to evaluate the H. pylori stool antigen test in patients with bleeding peptic ulcers. Patients with bleeding and nonbleeding peptic ulcers underwent a rapid urease test, histology, bacterial culture and H. pylori stool antigen test. Positive H. pylori infection was defined as a positive culture or both a positive histology and a positive rapid urease test. Helicobacter pylori stool antigen was assessed with a commercial kit (Diagnostec H. pylori antigen EIA Kit, Hong Kong). Between October 2000 and April 2002, 93 patients with bleeding peptic ulcers (men/women: 78/15, gastric ulcer/duodenal ulcer: 58/35) and 59 patients with nonbleeding peptic ulcers (men/women: 47/12, gastric ulcer/duodenal ulcer: 30/29) were enrolled in this study. Forty-seven (50.5%) patients with bleeding peptic ulcers and 30 (50.8%) patients with nonbleeding peptic ulcers, were found to be infected with H. pylori (p > .1). Helicobacter pylori stool antigen tests were positive in 54 (58.1%) and 30 (50.8%) patients with bleeding peptic ulcers and nonbleeding peptic ulcers, respectively (p > .1). The sensitivity (82% vs. 93%), specificity (68% vs. 93%), positive predictive value (74% vs. 93%), negative predictive value (77% vs. 93%) and diagnostic accuracy (75% vs. 93%) were all lower in patients with bleeding vs. nonbleeding peptic ulcers. The specificity, positive predictive value, and diagnostic accuracy of the H. pylori stool antigen test in patients with bleeding peptic ulcers were significantly lower than those in patients with nonbleeding peptic ulcers (p = .01, p = .02 and p = .003, respectively). The H. pylori stool antigen test is not reliable for diagnosing H. pylori infection in patients with bleeding peptic ulcers.

Helicobacter pylori chronic infection is associated with chronic gastritis, peptic ulcer, and gastric cancer. Cytotoxin-associated gene A (cagA)-positive H. pylori strains increase the risk of gastric pathology. The carcinogenic potential of CagA is linked to its polymorphic EPIYA motif variants. The goals of this study were to investigate the frequency of cagA-positive Helicobacter pylori in Mexican patients with gastric pathologies and to assess the association of cagA EPIYA motif patterns with peptic ulcer and gastric cancer. A total of 499 patients were studied; of these, 402 had chronic gastritis, 77 had peptic ulcer, and 20 had gastric cancer. H. pylori DNA, cagA, and the EPIYA motifs were detected in total DNA from gastric biopsies by PCR. The type and number of EPIYA segments were determined by the electrophoretic patterns. To confirm the PCR results, 20 amplicons of the cagA 3' variable region were sequenced, and analyzed in silico, and the amino acid sequence was predicted with MEGA software, version 5. The odds ratio (OR) was calculated to determine the associations between the EPIYA motif type and gastric pathology and between the number of EPIYA-C segments and peptic ulcers and gastric cancer. H. pylori DNA was found in 287 (57.5%) of the 499 patients, and 214 (74%) of these patients were cagA-positive. The frequency of cagA-positive H. pylori was 74.6% (164/220) in chronic gastritis patients, 73.6% (39/53) in peptic ulcer patients, and 78.6% (11/14) in gastric cancer patients. The EPIYA-ABC pattern was more frequently observed in chronic gastritis patients (79.3%, 130/164), while the EPIYA-ABCC sequence was more frequently observed in peptic ulcer (64.1%, 25/39) and gastric cancer patients (54.5%, 6/11). However, the risks of peptic ulcer (OR = 7.0, 95% CI = 3.3-15.1; p < 0.001) and gastric cancer (OR = 5.9, 95% CI = 1.5-22.1) were significantly increased in individuals who harbored the EPIYA-ABCC cagA gene pattern. cagA-positive H. pylori is highly prevalent in southern Mexico, and all CagA variants were of the western type. The cagA alleles that code for EPIYA-ABCC motif patterns are associated with peptic ulcers and gastric cancer.

The concentrations of free D- and L-amino acids were determined in the gastric juice from four groups: patients suffering from early gastric carcinoma with or without Helicobacter pylori infection, and patients without carcinoma but with peptic ulcers, duodenal ulcers or chronic gastritis with or without H. pylori infection. H. pylori is a bacterium associated with gastric inflammation and peptic ulcers and is a risk factor for stomach cancer. The highest D-amino acid ratios (free D-amino acid concentration to the total corresponding free D- and L-amino acid concentration) were 29%, 26%, 18%, 4% and 1% for proline, alanine, serine, aspartate and glutamate, respectively. The gastric juice levels of L-alanine, L-serine, L-proline, L-glutamate and D-alanine in the samples obtained from subjects bearing early gastric carcinoma and H. pylori were significantly higher than in the samples from the other three groups. Except for D-alanine, there was no correlation between the D-amino acid concentrations and presence of carcinoma or H. pylori.

Helicobacter pylori (H. pylori), a gram-negative microaerophilic bacterial pathogen that colonizes the stomachs of more than half of all humans, is linked to chronic gastritis, peptic ulcers and gastric cancer. Spiral-shaped H. pylori undergo morphologic conversion to a viable but not culturable coccoid form when they transit from the microaerobic stomach into the anaerobic intestinal tract. However, little is known about the morphological and pathogenic characteristics of H. pylori under prolonged anaerobic conditions. In this study, scanning electron microscopy was used to document anaerobiosis-induced morphological changes of H. pylori, from helical to coccoid to a newly defined fragmented form. Western blot analysis indicated that all three forms express certain pathogenic proteins, including the bacterial cytotoxin-associated gene A (CagA), components of the cag-Type IV secretion system (TFSS), the blood group antigen-binding adhesin BabA, and UreA (an apoenzyme of urease), almost equally. Similar urease activities were also detected in all three forms of H. pylori. However, in contrast to the helical form, bacterial motility and TFSS activity were found to have been abrogated in the anaerobiosis-induced coccoid and fragmented forms of H. pylori. Notably, it was demonstrated that some of the anaerobiosis-induced fragmented state cells could be converted to proliferation-competent helical bacteria in vitro. These results indicate that prolonged exposure to the anaerobic intestine may not eliminate the potential for H. pylori to revert to the helical pathogenic state.

Helicobacter pylori is the major causal factor in chronic gastritis. Its acquisition leads to a chronic, usually lifelong, inflammation of the gastric mucosa, which may gradually progress to atrophy (with intestinal metaplasia) in a significant proportion of infected individuals. This progression is probably multifactorial, being influenced by genetic or environmental factors in addition to H. pylori infection. The pathogenesis of peptic ulcer and gastric cancer is closely associated with H. pylori gastritis and its subsequent atrophic sequelae (atrophic gastritis). H. pylori-induced gastritis is an important risk factor in the multifactorial aetiology of these diseases. It causes a cascade of reactions that damage the gastric mucosa and epithelium in various ways. The specific mechanisms involved are largely unknown. Some are probably bacterium-related reactions, which are influenced by various virulence factors, and others are consequences of the mucosal inflammation and atrophy. The risk of peptic ulcer and gastric cancer in patients with H. pylori gastritis can be summarized as follows: i) the risk of both peptic ulcer and gastric cancer is low in individuals with a normal stomach; ii) the risk of peptic ulcer is approximately ten times higher and the risk of gastric cancer approximately twice as high in patients with non-atrophic H. pylori-positive gastritis as in those with a normal stomach; iii) these risks are further increased (twofold to threefold) when there is antral atrophy; whereas iv) in the presence of corpus atrophy the risk of gastric cancer remains high, but that of peptic ulcer decreases gradually to zero with increasing severity of corpus atrophy.
