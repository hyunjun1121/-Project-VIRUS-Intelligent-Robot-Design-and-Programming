Treatment of juvenile idiopathic arthritis (JIA) with disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs (DMARDs) may improve outcomes compared to conventional therapy (e.g., non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, intra-articular corticosteroids). The purpose of this systematic review was to evaluate the comparative effectiveness and safety of DMARDs versus conventional therapy and versus other DMARDs. A systematic evidence review of 156 reports identified in MEDLINE®, EMBASE®, and by hand searches. There is some evidence that methotrexate is superior to conventional therapy. Among children who have responded to a biologic DMARD, randomized discontinuation trials suggest that continued treatment decreases the risk of having a flare. However, these studies evaluated DMARDs with different mechanisms of action (abatacept, adalimumab, anakinra, etanercept, intravenous immunoglobulin, tocilizumab) and used varying comparators and follow-up periods. Rates of serious adverse events are similar between DMARDs and placebo in published trials. This review identified 11 incident cases of cancer among several thousand children treated with one or more DMARD. Few data are available to evaluate the comparative effectiveness of either specific DMARDs or general classes of DMARDs. However, based on the overall number, quality, and consistency of studies, there is moderate strength of evidence to support that DMARDs improve JIA-associated symptoms. Limited data suggest that short-term risk of cancer is low.

The efficacy of the biologic disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs (DMARDs) shown in clinical trials may be jeopardized due to prevalent poor patient adherence. Patient adherence including compliance and persistence with biologic DMARDs in rheumatoid arthritis. This is a comprehensive review of the literature. The various definitions and methodologies of measurement used in adherence research are reviewed and data are presented by separating compliance and persistence. Differences in compliance rates were mainly based on numerical trends. There was evidence for and against greater persistence with infliximab versus adalimumab and etanercept. There was a trend in favour of greater compliance and lower persistence with TNF-alpha inhibitor monotherapy versus in combination therapy with methotrexate. The evidence suggests that adherence to biologic DMARDs is suboptimal. When further research is applied in the field, agreed definitions and methodology need to be used to allow for cross-study comparisons. In addition, adherence should be assessed in conjunction with clinical outcomes and not on its own so that it can be better understood what levels of adherence provide the required clinical outcomes.

Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is the most common chronic inflammatory disorder and is associated with progressive destruction of synovial joints and physical disability. Therapies with known benefits include disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs (DMARDs), such as methotrexate, as well as more recent biologic agents, such as tumor necrosis factor inhibitors (anti-TNF therapy). This was a retrospective study, which included 205 RA and 112 early RA (ERA) patients from the Rheumatology Clinic at Gaziantep University School of Medicine Research Center as well as 104 healthy controls. The mean neutrophil to lymphocyte ratio (NLR) was found to be 3.15 ± 2.64 in the patient group and 2.03 ± 0.94 in the control group. The mean platelet to lymphocyte ratio (PLR) was 162.39 ± 107.76 in the patient group and 131.23 ± 48.09 in the control group. There was a significant difference in both the NLR and PLR between the patient and control groups (both p < 0.01). There was a significant difference in both the NLR and PLR between patients with active disease and remission (both p < 0.001) in RA, including anti-TNF therapy and DMARDs groups. There was a significant difference in NLR (p = 0.001) but not in PLR (p = 0.051) between active disease and remission in ERA. The results of the present study suggest that the NLR may be considered a useful marker of disease activity in RA and one that can aid the diagnosis of ERA. The PLR can be used in the assessment of disease activity in RA patients undergoing anti-TNF therapy but is not suitable for diagnosing ERA.

Healthcare of patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA) in Germany has mainly been evaluated in the past in RA cohorts from specialized arthritis centers. This study investigated rheumatological care on a population basis, using claims data from a nationwide statutory health insurance fund (BARMER GEK) in combination with patient-reported outcomes from a questionnaire survey of insured persons with RA. Data from insurants aged 18-79 years with M05 (seropositive RA) or M06 (other RA, ICD-10) diagnoses were analyzed concerning diagnostics, medication and prescribing physician. A 31-item questionnaire covering patient reported diagnosis, healthcare utilization and burden of illness was sent to a stratified random sample of 6193 insured persons. Data from the respondents regarding rheumatological care and disease status were evaluated. In 2013 and 2014, a total of 96,921 adults with M05 or M06 diagnosis were insured. The questionnaire was answered by 51% of the sample and of these 81% confirmed the RA diagnosis. RA had been diagnosed by a rheumatologist in 59% of the cases, 70% reported moderate to severe pain and 46% had functional disability. Between at least 40% (claims data) and up to 68% (respondents) were in specialized rheumatological care. Treatment with disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs (DMARDs) was 61% (claims data) and 63% (respondents) in persons in rheumatological care but only 18% outside rheumatological care. The results indicate that specialized rheumatological care is required to provide adequate treatment for patients with RA in Germany. Patients with higher age and patients with M06 diagnosis had less drug prescriptions and were less frequently treated by rheumatologists.

There are only six DMARDs (disease modifying anti-rheumatic drugs) available in the clinical practice, such as gold sodium thiomalate, D-penicillamine, bucillamine, auranofin, salazosulphapyridine, and lobenzarit disodium. It is important to select an appropriate DMARD for the patient. However, 57 of the 171 patients showed an adverse reaction toward one DMARD and 26 (46%) of these 57 patients showed undesirable reactions to other DMARDs. In this paper we emphasized (1) that this rate 46% of adverse reaction against multiple DMARDs was elevated and (2) that the rate of frequency of adverse reactions against two drugs was elevated. The ranking orders of the frequency of the adverse reactions of the switching of one DMARD to another are as follows; 1. gold sodium thiomalate to D-penicillamine, 2. gold sodium thiomalate to bucillamine, 3. D-penicillamine to bucillamine. Therefore, a special attention for switching DMARDs should be paid to the patient who has already shown an adverse reaction to one DMARD, and we should lower the dose of DMARDs administered to the patient. In addition, steroid was found not to decrease the rates of the adverse reaction against DMARDs.

Dramatic improvement seen in the prognosis of rheumatoid arthritis has been driven by higher expectations, led by newer drugs and more intensive use of the older drugs. Although methotrexate has retained its place as the first-line agent, there has been great interest in comparing biologicals to conventional Disease Modifying Anti Rheumatic Drugs (DMARDs) over the past few years with the updated guidelines from both the American College of Rheumatology and European League Against Rheumatism. We have tried to critically summarize the findings of some landmark trials that compare these two approaches. Treatment of Early Rheumatoid Arthritis, The Swedish Pharmacotherapy study and Rheumatoid Arthritis Comparison of Active Therapies are landmark trials that were designed to compare strategies using biologicals vs. conventional DMARDs. We will review the safety and efficacy data from these three trials here and also briefly the important cost differential. Methotrexate should be the first-line therapy for most rheumatoid arthritis patients and will produce the desired results in greater than one-third of the patients. When methotrexate is not adequate, triple DMARD therapy should be added which will result in control of approximately another one-third of the patients. Ultimately, and usually before 1 year of disease, the remainder of patients will require biological therapies usually added to conventional DMARDs. There is no evidence that this step-up approach results in any long-term disadvantage and good evidence that it results in substantial cost savings.

Tocilizumab (TCZ) and tumour necrosis factor inhibitors (TNFi) are recommended for the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis (RA) in patients with inadequate response (IR) to prior disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs (DMARDs). This retrospective analysis assessed the efficacy of TCZ and TNFi, alone or in combination with DMARDs, in 1603 patients with IR to previous treatment with either DMARDs (DMARD-IR) and/or TNFi (TNFi-IR), initiating treatment with TCZ or a TNFi, managed in routine clinical practice. Patients were grouped according to treatment history and treatment initiated: DMARD-IR patients initiating treatment with TCZ + DMARD (DMARD-IR TCZ) or TNFi + DMARD (DMARD-IR TNFi), DMARD-IR and/or TNFi-IR patients initiating treatment with TCZ monotherapy (TCZ mono) or TNFi monotherapy (TNFi mono), and TNFi-IR patients initiating treatment with TCZ + DMARD (TNFi-IR TCZ) or TNFi + DMARD (TNFi-IR TNFi). Patients initiating treatment with TCZ generally had more severe disease and longer disease duration compared with the corresponding TNFi group. Significantly more patients achieved remission (DAS28 ESR <2.6) in the TCZ groups compared with corresponding TNFi groups (DMARD-IR, TCZ 44.0 % vs. TNFi 29.6 %; monotherapy, TCZ 37.2 % vs. TNFi 30.2 %; TNF-IR, TCZ 41.3 % vs. TNFi 19.2 %; p < 0.001 for all comparisons). More patients achieved moderate-good responses (EULAR criteria) in the TCZ treatment groups (79-85 %) compared with TNFi treatment groups (65-81 %). Patient-reported outcomes showed greater improvements in TCZ compared with TNFi groups. In patients with inadequate response to DMARDs and/or TNFi treated in routine clinical practice, TCZ in combination with DMARDs or as monotherapy resulted in significantly more patients achieving remission and more marked improvements in patient-reported outcomes compared with TNF inhibitors.

To determine the utility of ultrasonography in guiding modification of disease-modifying anti-rheumatic drug (DMARD) and steroid therapy for inflammatory arthritis (IA) in routine clinical practice. In this retrospective study, we analyzed DMARD and steroid use in IA patients referred to a rheumatologist-led ultrasound clinic. Power Doppler (PD) vascularity and greyscale (GS) synovial hypertrophy joint findings were categorized as positive/negative for each patient. The erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) was used as a measure of disease activity. We assessed single visit data for 46 adult IA patients: 67.4% (n = 31) rheumatoid arthritis (RA), 15.2% (n = 7) psoriatic arthritis, 10.9% (n = 5) spondyloarthritis, and 6.5% (n = 3) undifferentiated IA. The mean ESR was 28.8 mm/h. Thirty-seven patients with both GS and PD ultrasound results were subsequently analyzed. All patients (n = 10) escalated and/or initiated on DMARD and 9/10 patients escalated or initiated on steroids were PD and GS positive. Six of seven patients with dose reduction and/or cessation of DMARDs and five of seven patients with dose reduction or cessation of steroids were PD negative. Of six patients who were GS positive and PD negative, three had dose reduction and/or cessation of DMARDs, while four had dose reduction of steroids; none of the six patients had DMARD/steroid escalation. By clarifying joint inflammation in an IA cohort with overall low ESR, ultrasonography of physician-selected joints can improve clinical assessment, resulting in treatment modification. Positive PD findings were particularly influential, while the clinical significance of GS positivity alone requires further investigation.

Disease modifying antirheumatic drugs (DMARDs) is a category of drugs which is used as medication in various arthritic conditions to arrest the progression of disease along with relief from pain. About 83% of population worldwide uses DMARDs. Withdrawal of COX-2 inhibitors because of cardiovascular side effects and short-term action associated with glucocorticoids provided a motivation for development of newer DMARDs. Currently non- biological DMARDs like methotrexate, sulfasalazine, hydroxychloroquine and azathioprine serve the purpose of relieving pain and inhibiting the progression of disease. Biological DMARDs like toclizumab, adalimumab, infliximab, golimumab and abatacept have shown more efficacy and lesser side effects as compared to non- biological DMARDs but their access to patient is less because of higher cost. DMARDs act by different mechanisms against inflammation like inhibition of tumor necrosis factor, suppression of IL-1 and TNF-α, induction of apoptosis of inflammatory cells, by increasing chemotactic factors, inhibition of purine synthesis, pyrimidine metabolism or purine embolism. DMARDs have important applications in diseases like rheumatoid arthritis, Crohn's disease, juvenile idiopathic arthritis, psoriatic arthritis and myasthenia gravis. Present review mainly focuses on DMARDs and their clinical applications giving an overview of their mechanism of action, pharmacokinetic properties, advantages over conventional therapies, shortcomings and recent trends.

Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is a progressive autoimmune disorder of joints that is associated with high health care costs, yet guidance is lacking on how early to initiate biologic disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs (DMARDs), a class of medications that is the major cost driver in RA management. Few studies have examined the factors associated with the transition from nonbiologic DMARDs, the first-line therapy for RA, to biologic DMARDs in RA patients.  To examine patient sociodemographics, medication use patterns, and clinical characteristics associated with initiation of biologic DMARDs.   This was a retrospective study using the Texas Medicaid prescription and medical claims database from July 1, 2003-December 31, 2010. Adults (aged 18-63 years) with an RA diagnosis (ICD-9-CM code 714.xx), no nonbiologic DMARD or biologic DMARD use during the 6-month pre-index period, and a minimum of 2 prescription claims for the same nonbiologic DMARD during the post-index period were included in the study. The index date was defined as the date when the first nonbiologic DMARD claim was made. Predictors of initiation of biologic DMARDs were age, gender, race, adherence (proportion of days covered), persistence to nonbiologic DMARDs, comorbidity (Charlson Comorbidity Index [CCI]), pain medication use, glucocorticoid use, and rheumatologist visit. Logistic regression was used to examine the factors associated with the initiation of biologic DMARDs.   A total of 2,714 patients were included. After controlling for patient characteristics, logistic regression showed, that compared with methotrexate (MTX) users, sulfasalazine (SSZ) and hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) users were less likely to initiate biologic DMARDs by 69.0% (OR = 0.310, 95% CI = 0.221-0.434, P  less than  0.0001) and 79.9% (OR = 0.201, 95% CI = 0.152-0.265, P  less than  0.0001), respectively. Nonbiologic DMARD dual therapy users were 39.1% less likely to initiate biologic DMARDs compared with nonbiologic DMARD monotherapy users (OR = 0.609, 95% CI = 0.463-0.803, P = 0.0004). With each year increase in age, patients were 1.6% less likely to start biologic DMARDs (OR = 0.984, 95% CI = 0.975-0.993, P = 0.0006). Compared with glucocorticoid users, glucocorticoid nonusers were 53.8% less likely to start on biologic DMARDs (OR = 0.462, 95% CI = 0.372-0.573, P  less than  0.0001). Patients with CCI scores of ≥ 3 were approximately 1.6 times more likely to initiate biologic DMARDs than those with CCI scores of 1 (OR = 1.618, 95% CI = 1.228-2.132, P = 0.0006).  Younger age, CCI scores ≥3, glucocorticoid use, MTX users (vs. SSZ and HCQ users), and nonbiologic DMARD monotherapy users (vs. dual therapy users) were significantly associated with higher likelihood to initiate biologic DMARDs. Recognizing these potential factors that drive the initiation of biologic DMARDs in this patient population, health care providers and Texas Medicaid should take measures to achieve optimal therapy for RA patients through thorough RA medication evaluation, well-structured RA monitoring programs, and patient education.

Given the availability of a number of alternative biologic treatment options and other novel disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs (DMARDs) for the treatment of patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA), clinicians are faced with an increasingly challenging choice regarding optimal treatment. Biologics are usually combined with traditional DMARDs, primarily methotrexate (MTX), but some biologics and tofacitinib (together referred to in this article as novel DMARDs) have been shown to be efficacious as monotherapy as well. In real-world practice, approximately one-third of RA patients receiving biologics are on monotherapy, primarily because of intolerance of, or noncompliance with, MTX. Limited data, however, are available analyzing the effectiveness of monotherapy compared with combination therapy across novel DMARDs. To compare American College of Rheumatology (ACR) responses to approved novel DMARDs used as monotherapy or as combination therapy with methotrexate (MTX) at 24 weeks in RA patients who have shown inadequate response to conventional DMARDs (DMARD-IR).  Through a systematic review of the literature, we identified randomized controlled trials that assessed approved novel DMARDs used as monotherapy or as combination therapy with MTX in DMARD-IR RA patients. Twenty-eight RCTs were identified that evaluated abatacept, anakinra, adalimumab, certolizumab pegol, etanercept, golimumab, infliximab, tocilizumab, or tofacitinib. ACR responses at 24 weeks were extracted and combined by means of Bayesian network meta-analyses.  With the exception of anakinra plus MTX, which was less efficacious, most novel DMARDs, when used in combination with MTX, demonstrated comparable ACR responses. When novel DMARDs were used as monotherapies, greater ACR20/50/70 responses were observed with tocilizumab than with anti-tumor necrosis factor agents (aTNF) or tofacitinib. Furthermore, ACR20/50/70 responses with tocilizumab plus MTX were similar to those with tocilizumab monotherapy (odds ratio [OR] for the indirect comparison = 1.08, 95% credible interval [CrI] = 0.40-2.84; OR = 1.24, CrI = 0.44-3.61; OR = 0.95, CrI = 0.33-2.72, respectively), whereas greater responses were observed with aTNF plus MTX than with aTNF monotherapy (OR = 2.41, CrI = 0.51-11.61; OR = 2.85, CrI = 0.51-17.67; OR = 1.28, CrI = 0.21-8.42, respectively). Relative efficacy estimates for the indirect comparison of tofacitinib plus MTX with tofacitinib monotherapy were very uncertain. Results suggest that in combination with MTX most of the available novel DMARDs have similar levels of efficacy in DMARD-IR patients. As monotherapy, however, tocilizumab displayed higher ACR responses than aTNF or tofacitinib. ACR responses with tocilizumab plus MTX were similar to those with tocilizumab as monotherapy, whereas aTNF in combination with MTX demonstrated greater ACR responses than aTNF as monotherapy.

The primary goal in the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is to maintain good quality of life by preventing joint destruction and avoiding disability. For this purpose, all patients with the diagnosis of RA should be treated by disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs (DMARDs) including biologic DMARDs and non-biologic DMARDs. All DMARDs are expected to prevent the progression of bone and cartilage destruction of RA patients from the results of in vitro research, and prevention of joint destruction is confirmed in vivo in all biologic DMARDs, but not in all non-biologic DMARDs. In this chapter, we would like to review the results of basic researches and clinical studies to demonstrate the prevention of joint destruction by non-biologic DMARDs that have been frequently used I daily practice.

When rheumatoid arthritis (RA) patients have achieved sustained good clinical responses can their disease-modifying anti-rheumatic drugs (DMARDs) be reduced or discontinued? This review addresses this question by summarising the clinical evidence about DMARD withdrawal. It includes an assessment of predictive factors for sustained DMARD-free remissions. We evaluated the evidence for discontinuing DMARDs in stable RA in both randomised controlled trials (RCTs) and observational studies. Six RCTs evaluated DMARD monotherapy withdrawal in 501 RA patients with good clinical responses. Flares occurred in 43/248 (17%) patients who continued DMARD monotherapy and in 117/253 (46%) patients who discontinued DMARDs. Individuals in whom DMARDs were withdrawn were three times more likely to have flares. Restarting DMARDs post-flare was usually successful. Four RCTs evaluated step-down DMARD combinations in comparison to DMARD monotherapy. Patients achieved good clinical responses with combination DMARDs, which were maintained after treatment was tapered to DMARD monotherapy. Four observational studies of tapering or stopping DMARDs in patients with sustained low disease activity states provided supportive evidence for discontinuing DMARDs in some patients. Flares during drug-free remissions were predicted by rheumatoid factor and anti-citrullinated protein antibody status. Drug-free remission is achievable in some RA patients. Discontinuation of DMARDs after patients achieve sustained remissions results in flares in many patients, which can usually be reversed by restarting DMARDs. Step-down DMARD combinations are effective and achieve sustained responses. Further research is required to establish predictors of drug-free remission; these will identify individuals most likely to benefit or experience disease flares after discontinuing DMARDs.

Disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs (DMARDs) have largely contributed to recent paradigm shift of rheumatoid arthritis (RA) treatment strategy. DMARDs can be indicated for all RA patients and early use of DMARDs after diagnosis of RA is recommended. Individual DMARDs have common characteristics. Understanding these characteristics is very important in treating RA. As for safety, the pattern of adverse reactions (ADRs) associated with DMARDs has been generally understood. It is necessary to select DMARDs and follow up patients with recognition of the pattern of ADRs. Regular monitoring is also essential to ensure the safety of DMARDs. This chapter deals with some major DMARDs in Japan, including methotrexate, which is indispensable in current RA treatment; salazosulfapyridine and bucillamine; tacrolimus, which is recently increasing in use; and iguratimod, which became available in 2012.

Patients and rheumatologists have a number of options to consider for the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis (RA), including biologic response modifier (BRM) therapy and diseasemodifying antirheumatic drugs (DMARDs). The objective of this study was to identify the considerations that are most important to patients and rheumatologists when deciding to initiate BRM therapy for RA. An online survey was conducted by Harris Interactive (Rochester, NY) and completed in January 2007. Patients receiving BRMs were asked to rank their considerations in initiating BRM therapy, patients receiving DMARDs were asked to rank their considerations in switching to or initiating BRM therapy, and rheumatologists were asked to rank their considerations in prescribing BRM therapy. Participants arranged the following 9 factors from most to least important: efficacy, safety/side effects, years on market, physician's experience with product, physician's personal preference, method of administration, dosing frequency, cost (out of pocket), and patient support programs. A total of 400 rheumatologists and 729 patients were surveyed (BRMs, n = 504; DMARDs, n = 225). The following factors were ranked consistently high across groups: safety (ranked first, first, and second for BRM patients, DMARD patients, and rheumatologists, respectively), efficacy (second, fourth, and first, respectively), and physician's experience with the drug (third for all 3 groups). Years on market (ranked seventh, sixth, and seventh, respectively) and availability of patient support groups ranked consistently low. When considering BRM therapy for RA, the 3 most important factors for patients and physicians are safety, efficacy, and the physician's experience with the product.

This is a demand-based infodemiology study using the Google Trends and AdWords tools to illustrate infodemiology's potential use in rheumatology. The study investigates three questions in North American countries: (1) What terms associated with "rheumatology" and "arthritis" do people search for on Google? (2) What is the search volume for disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs (DMARDs)? and (3) What is the search volume for the term "arthritis" compared with for "hepatitis C" and "breast cancer"? We conducted independent searches by country and search term for 2015-2017. Seventeen DMARDs were searched for 2015 through May 2018, with the turmeric remedy included for comparison. Data were exported to Excel for further analysis, adjusted by country population, and expressed as searches per 100,000 inhabitants (SpTh). There were approximately 550 associated terms for "arthritis" in each country, and 5679 SpTh for DMARDs across the three countries. Searches for turmeric numbered slightly lower than for all DMARDs together in Canada and the USA, but were 70% higher in Mexico. Turmeric was also searched four times more than the most-searched biological DMARD in Canada and the USA, and 60 times more in Mexico. Arthritis was more commonly searched for in Canada than hepatitis C and breast cancer, but hepatitis C was highest in the USA and breast cancer in Mexico. Monthly trends did not show expected peaks associated with arthritis awareness campaigns. Infodemiology provides preliminary information that could help in generating hypotheses, assessing health-care interventions, or even in providing patient-centered care.

To explore what considerations patients have when deciding about disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs (DMARDs) and what information patients need to participate in the decision-making process. In-depth face-to-face interviews were conducted with 32 patients with inflammatory arthritis who recently consulted their rheumatologist and discussed initiating DMARDs. Beliefs in the necessity of DMARDs, either for relief of symptoms or prevention of future joint damage, were reasons to initiate DMARDs. Furthermore, trust in the rheumatologist and the health care system was important in this respect. Patients expressed many concerns about initiating DMARDS. These related to the perceived aggressive and harmful nature of DMARDs, potential (or unknown) side effects, influence on fertility and pregnancy, combination with other medicines, time to benefit, and manner of administration. Participants also worried about the future regarding long-term medication use and drug dependency, and if a medicine proved to be ineffective, about the risks of future treatments and running out of options. To decrease uncertainty, participants wanted to be informed about multiple treatment options, both current and future. They not only wanted clinical information but also information on how the medications could affect their daily lives. Health education should inform patients about multiple treatment options, for the present as well as for the future. It should enable patients to compare treatments with regard to both clinical aspects as well as possible consequences for their daily lives.

Disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs (DMARDs) are the standard of care for rheumatoid arthritis (RA); however, studies have found that many patients do not receive them. We examined predictors of starting and stopping DMARDs among a longitudinal cohort of patients with RA. Study participants came from a cohort of RA patients recruited from a random sample of rheumatologists' practices in Northern California. We examined patterns and predictors of stopping and starting nonbiologic and biologic DMARDs during 1982-2009 based on annual questionnaires. Stopping was defined as stopping all DMARDs and starting was defined as transitioning from no DMARDs to any DMARDs across 2 consecutive years. The analysis of starting DMARDs included 471 subjects with 1,974 pairs of years with no DMARD use in the first of 2 consecutive years. From this population, subjects started DMARD use by year 2 in 313 (15.9%) of the pairs. The analysis of stopping DMARDs included 1,026 subjects with 7,595 pairs of years with DMARD use in the first of 2 consecutive years; in 423 pairs (5.6%), subjects stopped DMARD use by year 2. In models that adjusted for RA-related factors, sociodemographics, and comorbidities, significant predictors of starting DMARDs included younger age, Hispanic ethnicity, shorter disease duration, and the use of oral glucocorticoids. In separate adjusted models, predictors of stopping DMARDs included Hispanic ethnicity and low income, while younger age was associated with a reduced risk of stopping. Efforts to improve DMARD use should focus on patient age, ethnicity, and income and RA-related factors.

Disease-modifying anti-rheumatic drugs (DMARDs) are the cornerstone of rheumatoid arthritis (RA) pharmacotherapy and should be initiated promptly after RA diagnosis. We examined trends in use of traditional and biologic DMARDs, and non-DMARD treatments, among overall RA patients, and factors associated with DMARD initiation in the newly diagnosed RA. RA subjects identified with the Quebec administrative databases were followed between January 1, 2002, and December 31, 2008. DMARD use was characterized on November 1 of each year using cross-sectional analyses. For a subgroup of newly diagnosed subjects, we used multivariable logistic regressions to identify predictors of DMARD initiation within 12 months of diagnosis and survival analyses to appraise time to DMARD initiation. A total of 37,399 subjects were included (65.8 % ≥65 years; 70.5 % female). The percentage of subjects using any DMARDs increased over the study period from 41.4 % [95 % confidence interval (CI) 40.8-42.0] to 43.3 % (95 % CI 42.7-43.9). Among newly diagnosed RA, being followed by a rheumatologist was the strongest predictor of DMARD initiation (odds ratio 4.31; 95 % CI 3.73-4.97). Care by an internist, increasing calendar year, use of NSAIDs, corticosteroids, or opioids, and a history of hospitalization increased the likelihood of DMARD initiation. Older age, female, higher comorbidity score, number of medical visits pre-diagnosis, care by other specialists, and the use of acetaminophen were inversely associated with DMARD initiation. The probability of any DMARD initiation at 12 months was 38.5 %. Despite the clinical practice guideline recommendations for earlier aggressive RA management, DMARD use appears to be suboptimal in Quebec.

Disease-modifying antirheumatic drug (DMARD) therapy is now clearly accepted as the primary treatment for rheumatoid arthritis, with an increasing emphasis on use of combination therapy. Data on combination therapy have highlighted the difficulties in performing these studies and the large number of patients required to produce meaningful results. Combination studies have focused on use of rapidly decreasing high-dose steroids as a part of the combination and emphasize the importance of using patients with early rheumatoid arthritis. Even with relatively aggressive use of DMARDs, the majority of patients develop erosions. Adverse reactions to DMARDs continue to concern clinicians, although evaluation of the frequency of these events has led to a reappraisal of previously accepted monitoring strategies in some cases. For example, it may not be cost-effective to subject patients on antimalarials to regular review by an ophthalmologist because of the low frequency of serious eye defects. Studies have also identified risk factors for the development of pulmonary toxicity in association with methotrexate. That DMARDs are effective in treating rheumatoid arthritis is beyond question-just how effective they are and what combinations of DMARDs will show improved efficacy will provide data for the next annual review.

Biologic disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs (DMARDs) are increasingly used for rheumatoid arthritis (RA) treatment. However, little is known based on contemporary data about the factors associated with DMARDs and patterns of use of biologic DMARDs for initial and subsequent RA treatment. We conducted an observational cohort study using claims data from a commercial health plan (2004-2013) and Medicaid (2000-2010) in three study groups: patients with early untreated RA who were naïve to any type of DMARD and patients with prevalent RA with or without prior exposure to one biologic DMARD. Multivariable logistic regression models were used to examine the effect of patient demographics, clinical characteristics and healthcare utilization factors on the initial and subsequent choice of biologic DMARDs for RA. We identified a total of 195,433 RA patients including 78,667 (40%) with early untreated RA and 93,534 (48%) and 23,232 (12%) with prevalent RA, without or with prior biologic DMARD treatment, respectively. Patients in the commercial insurance were 87% more likely to initiate a biologic DMARD versus patients in Medicaid (OR = 1.87, 95% CI = 1.70-2.05). In Medicaid, African-Americans had lower odds of initiating (OR = 0.59, 95% CI = 0.51-0.68 in early untreated RA; OR = 0.71, 95% CI = 0.61-0.74 in prevalent RA) and switching (OR = 0.71, 95% CI = 0.55-0.90) biologic DMARDs than non-Hispanic whites. Prior use of steroid and non-biologic DMARDs predicted both biologic DMARD initiation and subsequent switching. Etanercept, adalimumab, and infliximab were the most commonly used first-line and second-line biologic DMARDS; patients on anakinra and golimumab were most likely to be switched to other biologic DMARDS. Insurance type, race, and previous use of steroids and non-biologic DMARDs were strongly associated with initial or subsequent treatment with biologic DMARDs.

Therapy of rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is typically characterized by the sequential use of disease-modifying anti-rheumatic drugs (DMARDs). This study aimed to reveal treatment patterns with traditional DMARDs and their changes during the two decades before the recent introduction of new DMARDs. A total of 593 RA patients were followed from their first presentation to our clinic throughout the course of their disease; 222 patients received their first DMARD therapy while under our care. More than 2,300 patient years of therapy were analysed for the efficacy [using C-reactive protein (CRP) and erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) as surrogates] and duration of drug therapy of consecutive DMARDs. Before 1985, 65-90% of initial DMARDs were gold compounds, but their use decreased continuously thereafter. Antimalarial (AM) drugs were important initial DMARDs in new patients at all times, whereas sulphasalazine (SSZ) and methotrexate (MTX) gained increasing significance after 1985 (the first DMARD was MTX in up to 29% of new patients). Penicillamine (DPA), azathioprine (AZP), cyclosporin (CyA) and combination therapies were not usually employed initially, but were reserved for the later course of the disease. Gender, age and rheumatoid factor were not different between patients receiving different DMARDs. The baseline acute-phase response was higher in patients treated with MTX (mean CRP 3.5 mg/dl) than in those treated with SSZ (CRP 2.4 mg/dl; P < 0.05) or AM (CRP 2.1 mg/dl; P < 0.05), suggesting that MTX was used preferentially in patients with high disease activity. On the other hand, once AM or SSZ had been discontinued, MTX was the most common subsequent DMARD (in 31 and 56% respectively). Comparison of first DMARDs with subsequent ones revealed that first DMARDs were more effective: the acute-phase response decreased most prominently during first therapies (CRP reduction was 1.28 mg/dl during first courses and 0.35 mg/dl during fourth or later courses; P < 0.01); and retention rates were significantly longer for first compared with subsequent therapies (median of 24.5 months for first and 18.6 months for fourth or subsequent therapies; P < 0.001). MTX was the most commonly employed DMARD therapy for RA and was used increasingly as first therapy in newly diagnosed RA. Patients with high disease activity were given MTX therapy more often than other DMARDs, while those with low activity were more likely to receive SSZ or AM, and MTX on failure of these drugs. First DMARDs in new patients were retained longer than subsequent DMARDs, apparently because they are more effective.

Tofacitinib (Xeljanz(®)) is the first approved drug in a new class of disease modifying antirheumatic drugs (DMARDs), the Janus kinase (JAK) inhibitors. JAKs have a pivotal role in triggering cytokine-induced signal transduction pathways that influence normal and pathological cellular processes of haematopoiesis and immune cell function, including pathogenic mechanisms involved in rheumatoid arthritis (RA). Selective inhibition of JAKs by tofacitinib potentially modulates inflammatory processes and provides a novel approach for the treatment of RA. Oral tofacitinib is indicated for the treatment of adult patients with active RA who have had an inadequate response to methotrexate and/or other DMARDs. In several large well designed trials, tofacitinib, in combination with methotrexate or other nonbiological DMARDs or as monotherapy, was an effective and generally well tolerated DMARD for the treatment of adult patients with moderately to severely active RA who had had an inadequate response to previous DMARDs, including tumour necrosis factor-α inhibitors. Direct head-to-head trials and/or further clinical experience (including long-term safety data), along with robust pharmacoeconomic studies, are required to more definitively position tofacitinib relative to other currently available DMARDs. In the meantime, tofacitinib (alone or in combination with nonbiological DMARDs) is an emerging option for the treatment of DMARD-experienced adult patients with moderately to severely active RA who have had an inadequate response to or are intolerant of methotrexate or other DMARDs.
