Which signaling pathway does LY294002 inhibit?

[PMID: 34820336]
Internal tandem duplications (ITD) mutation within FMS-like tyrosine kinase 3 (FLT3), the most frequent mutation happens in almost 20% acute myeloid leukemia (AML) patients, always predicts a poor prognosis. As a small molecule tyrosine kinase inhibitor, sorafenib is clinically used for the treatment of advanced renal cell carcinoma (RCC), hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), and differentiated thyroid cancer (DTC), with its preclinical and clinical activity demonstrated in the treatment of Fms-like tyrosine kinase 3-internal tandem duplication (FLT3-ITD) mutant AML. Even though it shows a rosy future in the AML treatment, the short response duration remains a vital problem that leads to treatment failure. Rapid onset of drug resistance is still a thorny problem that we cannot overlook. Although the mechanisms of drug resistance have been studied extensively in the past years, there is still no consensus on the exact reason for resistance and without effective therapeutic regimens established clinically. My previous work reported that sorafenib-resistant FLT3-ITD mutant AML cells displayed mitochondria dysfunction, which rendered cells depending on glycolysis for energy supply. In my present one, we further illustrated that losing the target protein FLT3 and the continuously activated PI3K/Akt signaling pathway may be the reason for drug resistance, with sustained activation of PI3K/AKT signaling responsible for the highly glycolytic activity and adenosine triphosphate (ATP) generation. PI3K inhibitor, LY294002, can block PI3K/AKT signaling, further inhibit glycolysis to disturb ATP production, and finally induce cell apoptosis. This finding would pave the way to remedy the FLT3-ITD mutant AML patients who failed with FLT3 targeted therapy.
