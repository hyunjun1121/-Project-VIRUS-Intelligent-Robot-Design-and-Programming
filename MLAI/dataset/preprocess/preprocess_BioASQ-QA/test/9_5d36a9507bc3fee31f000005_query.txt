There is evidence for both physiological functions of the natural neurotransmitter, acetylcholine, and pharmacological actions of the plant alkaloid, nicotine, on the development and function of the immune system. The effects of continuous exposure to nicotine over a 12-day course of fetal thymus organ culture (FTOC) were studied, and thymocytes were analyzed by flow cytometry. In the presence of very low concentrations of nicotine many more immature T cells (defined by low or negative TCR expression) and fewer mature T cells (intermediate or high expression of TCR) were produced. In addition, the numbers of cells expressing CD69 and, to a lesser extent, CD95 (Fas) were increased. These effects took place when fetal thymus lobes from younger (13-14 days gestation) pups were used for FTOC. If FTOC were set up using tissue from older (15-16 days gestation pups), nicotine had little effect, suggesting that it may act only on immature T cell precursors. Consistent with an increase in immature cells, the expression of recombinase-activating genes was found to be elevated. Nicotine effects were partially blocked by the simultaneous addition of the nicotinic antagonist d-tubocurarine. Furthermore, d-tubocurarine alone blocked the development of both immature and mature murine thymocytes, suggesting the presence of an endogenous ligand that may engage nicotinic acetylcholine receptors on developing thymocytes and influence the course of normal thymic ontogeny.

CD4+CD8+ double-positive (DP) T cells represent a minor subpopulation of T lymphocytes found in the periphery of adult rats. In this study, we show that peripheral DP T cells appear among the first T cells that colonize the peripheral lymphoid organs during fetal life, and represent approximately 40% of peripheral T cells during the perinatal period. Later their proportion decreases to reach the low values seen in adulthood. Most DP T cells are small size lymphocytes that do not exhibit an activated phenotype, and their proliferative rate is similar to that of the other peripheral T cell subpopulations. Only 30-40% of DP T cells expresses CD8beta chain, the remaining cells expressing CD8alphaalpha homodimers. However, both DP T cell subsets have an intrathymic origin since they appear in the recent thymic emigrant population after injection of FITC intrathymically. Functionally, although DP T cells are resistant to undergo apoptosis in response to glucocorticoids, they show poor proliferative responses upon CD3/TCR stimulation due to their inability to produce IL-2. A fraction of DP T cells are not actively synthesizing the CD8 coreceptor, and they gradually differentiate to the CD4 cell lineage in reaggregation cultures. Transfer of DP T lymphocytes into thymectomized SCID mice demonstrates that these cells undergo post-thymic maturation in the peripheral lymphoid organs and that their CD4 cell progeny is fully immunocompetent, as judged by its ability to survive and expand in peripheral lymphoid organs, to proliferate in response to CD3 ligation, and to produce IL-2 upon stimulation.

In the thymus, a T-cell repertoire able to confer protection against infectious and noninfectious agents in a peptide-dependent, self-MHC-restricted manner is selected. Direct detection of Ag-specific thymocytes, and analysis of the impact of the expression of the MHC-restricting allele on their frequency or function has never been studied in humans because of the extremely low precursor frequency. Here, we used a tetramer-based enrichment protocol to analyze the ex vivo frequency and activation-phenotype of human thymocytes specific for self, viral and tumor-antigens presented by HLA-A*0201 (A2) in individuals expressing or not this allele. Ag-specific thymocytes were quantified within both CD4CD8 double or single-positive compartments in every donor. Our data indicate that the maturation efficiency of Ag-specific thymocytes is poorly affected by HLA-A2 expression, in terms of frequencies. Nevertheless, A2-restricted T-cell lines from A2(+) donors reacted to A2(+) cell lines in a highly peptide-specific fashion, whereas their alloreactive counterparts showed off-target activity. This first ex vivo analysis of human antigen-specific thymocytes at different stages of human T-cell development should open new perspectives in the understanding of the human thymic selection process.

Transgenic mice expressing the E7 protein of HPV16 from the keratin 14 promoter demonstrate increasing thymic hypertrophy with age. This hypertrophy is associated with increased absolute numbers of all thymocyte types, and with increased cortical and medullary cellularity. In the thymic medulla, increased compartmentalization of the major thymic stromal cell types and expansion of thymic epithelial cell population is observed. Neither an increased rate of immature thymocyte division nor a decreased rate of immature thymocyte death was able to account for the observed hypertrophy. Thymocytes with reduced levels of expression of CD4 and/or CD8 were more abundant in transgenic (tg) mice and became increasingly more so with age. These thymic SP and DP populations with reduced levels of CD4 and/or CD8 markers had a lower rate of apoptosis in the tg than in the non-tg mice. The rate of export of mature thymocytes to peripheral lymphoid organs was less in tg animals relative to the pool of available mature cells, particularly for the increasingly abundant CD4lo population. We therefore suggest that mature thymocytes that would normally die in the thymus gradually accumulated in E7 transgenic animals, perhaps as a consequence of exposure to a hypertrophied E7-expressing thymic epithelium or to factors secreted by this expanded thymic stromal cell population. The K14E7 transgenic mouse thus provides a unique model to study effects of the thymic epithelial cell compartment on thymus development and involution.

The mRNA for dopamine receptors of type D1, D3, D5, but not type D2, was detected in the thymus of rats starting from day 16 of embryonic development (E16). Dopamine at concentrations of 10<sup>-8</sup>-10<sup>‒6</sup> M inhibited fetus thymocyte response to mitogen, confirming the functionality of the receptors and the possibility of a direct effect of dopamine on the developing thymus. Pharmacological inhibition of catecholamine synthesis in the crucial period of thymus development leads to long-term changes in the T-system immunity due to increased production of natural regulatory T-lymphocytes. The presence and functional activity of dopamine receptors in the fetal thymus indicates its ability to influence the development of the immune system of rats during ontogeny.

Regain of immunocompetence after myeloablation and bone marrow cell (BMC) reconstitution essentially depends on T progenitor homing into the thymus and intrathymic T cell maturation. CD44 facilitates progenitor homing and settlement in the bone marrow and is known as a T progenitor marker. In search for improving regain of immunocompetence after BMC reconstitution, we explored whether the CD44 standard (CD44 s) and/or variant isoforms CD44v6 and CD44v7 contribute to thymus repopulation and thymocyte maturation. Antibody-blocking studies and cells/mice with a targeted deletion of CD44v6/7 or CD44v7 revealed that CD44s, but not CD44v6 and CD44v7, has a major impact on progenitor cell homing into the thymus. Instead, CD44v6 strengthens apoptosis resistance and expansion of early thymocytes. CD44v6-induced apoptosis resistance, most strong in double-negative (DN) thymocytes, is accompanied by Akt activation. CD44v6-induced proliferation of DN cells proceeds via activation of the MAPK pathway. At later stages of T cell maturation, CD44 acts as an accessory molecule, initiating and supporting TCR/CD3 complex-mediated signal transduction in double-positive and single-positive thymocytes. Thus, CD44 plays a major role in thymus homing. In addition, CD44v6 is important for survival and expansion of early thymocytes. These findings suggest that strengthening CD44v6 expression on lymphoid progenitors could well contribute to accelerated regain of immunocompetence.

Generation of functional (CD4+)(CD8-)CD25+ regulatory T cells (Treg) in the murine thymus depends on FoxP3. Removal of the thymus from neonatal mice has been shown to result in a multiple organ autoimmune disease phenotype that can be prevented by introducing the FoxP3+ Treg population to the animal. It has therefore, been proposed that functional FoxP3+ Treg cells are not made in the neonatal thymus; however, it remains unclear when and where functional (FoxP3+)(CD4+)(CD8-)CD25+ thymocytes are generated in postnatal thymus. We report that neither FoxP3 mRNA nor protein is expressed in (CD4+)(CD8-)CD25+, or (CD4+)(CD8-)CD25- thymocytes until 3-4 days post birth, despite the presence of mature (CD4+)(CD8-)CD25+/- thymocytes in the thymus by 1-2 days after birth. (FoxP3-)(CD4+)(CD8-)CD25+ thymocytes from day 2 newborn mice show no Treg activity. Interestingly, we are able to detect low numbers of FoxP3+ thymocytes dispersed throughout the medullary region of the thymus as early as 3-4 days post birth. Expression of FoxP3 is induced in embryonic day 17 fetal thymus organ culture (FTOC) after 4-6 days of in vitro culture. Treatment of FTOCs with thymic stromal derived lymphopoietin (TSLP) enhanced expression of FoxP3, and blocking the TSLP receptor reduces FoxP3 expression in FTOC. Furthermore, TSLP stimulates FoxP3 expression in purified (CD4+)CD8- thymocytes, but not in (CD4+)CD8+, (CD4-)CD8+ and (CD4-)CD8- thymocytes. Expression of FoxP3 or Treg maturation is ontogenically distinct and kinetically delayed from the generation of (CD4+)(CD8-)CD25+ or (CD4+)(CD8-)CD25- thymocytes in the postnatal thymus. TSLP produced from medullary thymic epithelia cells (mTEC) contributes to the expression of FoxP3 and the maturation of natural regulatory T cells. Overall, these results suggest that the development of Treg cells requires paracrine signaling during late stages of thymocyte maturation that is distinct from signaling during positive or negative selection.

Positive selection occurs in the thymic cortex, but critical maturation events occur later in the medulla. Here we defined the precise stage at which T cells acquired competence to proliferate and emigrate. Transcriptome analysis of late gene changes suggested roles for the transcription factor NF-κB and interferon signaling. Mice lacking the inhibitor of NF-κB (IκB) kinase (IKK) kinase TAK1 underwent normal positive selection but exhibited a specific block in functional maturation. NF-κB signaling provided protection from death mediated by the cytokine TNF and was required for proliferation and emigration. The interferon signature was independent of NF-κB; however, thymocytes deficient in the interferon-α (IFN-α) receptor IFN-αR showed reduced expression of the transcription factor STAT1 and phenotypic abnormality but were able to proliferate. Thus, both NF-κB and tonic interferon signals are involved in the final maturation of thymocytes into naive T cells.

The finding of peanut agglutinin (PNA) binding capacity, supposed to be a marker of immature lymphocytes, within the T-cell population of the human thymus (58%) and tonsil (10%) prompted the comparison of maturation stages of PNA binding (PNA+) and nonbinding (PNA-) T cells in both organs. The proliferative response after mitogenic stimulation of purified PNA+ fractions was significantly less than that of purified PNA- fractions. The results of mitogen dose-response experiments, of variation in time of culture harvest, and of addition of irradiated allogeneic peripheral blood non-T cells indicated the intrinsic mitogen unresponsiveness of cells in the PNA+ fractions. The mitogen response of tonsil fractions was higher than that of thymocyte fractions. Cells with an immature immunologic phenotype were enriched in the thymocyte PNA+ fraction, and almost absent in the tonsil fractions. Both tonsil fractions contained cells with the immunologic phenotype of mature T cells, and showed a purine interconversion enzyme makeup comparable to mature T lymphocytes. It is concluded that the tonsil PNA+ T cell is a functionally immature lymphocyte which is in a further maturation stage than PNA+ or PNA- thymocytes. The presence of PNA+ T cells outside the thymus is of relevance for the clinical evaluation of PNA binding assays and suggests the occurrence of T-cell maturation within the tonsil environment.
