de Quervain's disease is an inadequacy into the first extensor compartment of wrist between the osteofibrous tunnel and the tendons. This mechanical conflict generates a tenosynovitis of the extensor pollicis brevis and the abductor pollicis longus tendons in first dorsal extensor compartment of the wrist. (1) To compare the clinical results obtained by longitudinal and transverse incisions and (2) the implication of clinical results in Indian population. This study was conducted at Kalpana Chawla Government Medical College, Karnal, Haryana. The inclusion criteria were positive Finkelstein's test and no response to non-surgical treatment for 6 weeks. Forty-eight patients with de Quervain's disease who did not respond to conservative treatment were operated with two different incisions. The patients were followed at 6 weeks, 3 and 6 months to compare the surgical outcomes. During a three-month follow-up, a significant difference was shown between the two methods (p = 0.0001). Results of surgical treatment with longitudinal incision were better (only one hypertrophic scar), but there were 12 postoperative complications with transverse incision. Visual analog scale (VAS) was used to evaluate the hypertrophic scar. In transverse incision group, out of five patients, four patients who developed hypertrophic scar have poor score according to VAS. Overall, longitudinal incision should be used for surgical treatment for de Quervain's disease due to lower risk of complications.

The De Quervain's tenosynovitis is an inadequacy into the first extensor compartment between the osteo-fibrous tunnel and the tendons. This mechanical conflict generates a tenosynovitis of the extensor pollicis brevis and the abductor pollicis longus tendons in first dorsal extensor compartment of the wrist. The authors report a retrospective study of 20 patients who have been treated by a longitudinal surgical approach. The mean age was 49 years old with a net female predominance. The Finkelstein's test was positive in all cases. All patients were treated operatively by incision of the sheath, which was sufficient to unwind the dorsal compartment tendons. The sheath palmar flap has been sutured with skin (Le Viet plasty) to avoid a further tendons luxation. At three years follow-up, the functional results were good in all the patients. However, non-aesthetic scars were noticed in three patients. We did not notice neither a case of anesthesia of the radial nerve nor a tendinous luxation in our series. The stenosing tenosynovitis of the first dorsal extensor compartment of the wrist is a relatively frequent pathology in the young woman. We use a longitudinal surgical approach to avoid the radial nerve lesions. Le Viet procedure using the palmar flap of the pulley fixed to the dermis works as a barrier and maintains the tendons sliding on the radial styloid groove.

De Quervain's tenosynovitis is a disorder characterised by pain on the radial (thumb) side of the wrist and functional disability of the hand. It can be treated by corticosteroid injection, splinting and surgery. To summarise evidence on the efficacy and safety of corticosteroid injections for de Quervain's tenosynovitis. We searched the following databases: the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) (The Cochrane Library 2009, Issue 2), MEDLINE (1966 to April 2009), EMBASE (1956 to April 2009), CINAHL (1982 to April 2009), AMED (1985 to April 2009), DARE, Dissertation Abstracts and PEDro (physiotherapy evidence database). Randomised and controlled clinical trials evaluating the efficacy and safety of corticosteroid injections for de Quervain's tenosynovitis. After screening abstracts of studies identified by the search we obtained full text articles of studies which fulfilled the selection criteria. We extracted data using a predefined electronic form. We assessed the methodological quality of included trials by using the checklist developed by Jadad and the Delphi list. We extracted data on the primary outcome measures: treatment success; severity of pain or tenderness at the radial styloid; functional impairment of the wrist or hand; and outcome of Finkelstein's test, and the secondary outcome measures: proportion of patients with side effects; type of side effects and patient satisfaction with injection treatment. We found one controlled clinical trial of 18 participants (all pregnant or lactating women) that compared one steroid injection with methylprednisolone and bupivacaine to splinting with a thumb spica. All patients in the steroid injection group (9/9) achieved complete relief of pain whereas none of the patients in the thumb spica group (0/9) had complete relief of pain, one to six days after intervention (number needed to treat to benefit (NNTB) = 1, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.8 to 1.2). No side effects or local complications of steroid injection were noted. The efficacy of corticosteroid injections for de Quervain's tenosynovitis has been studied in only one small controlled clinical trial, which found steroid injections to be superior to thumb spica splinting. However, the applicability of our findings to daily clinical practice is limited, as they are based on only one trial with a small number of included participants, the methodological quality was poor and only pregnant and lactating women participated in the study. No adverse effects were observed.

This short paper demonstrates that the Finkelstein's test in De Quervain's tenosynovitis is based on an incorrect assumption. The correct basis for a pathognomic manoeuvre in De Quervain is the provocation of tendons attrition of the first wrist dorsal compartment against their pulley which elicits pain. The Brunelli's test induces this friction and pain by asking the patient to hardly adduct the thumb with the wrist in radial deviation.

De Quervain's stenosing tendovaginitis is an inflammation of the first dorsal compartment. It is considered to be one of the most common forms of inflammation of the tendon sheaths. The diagnosis is based on the case history and the clinical examination. Finkelstein's test is pathognomonic. Should conservative treatment not prove successful, the condition is readily amenable to surgical treatment.

De Quervain's disease has different clinical features. Different tests have been described in the past, the most popular test being the Eichhoff's test, often wrongly named as the Finkelstein's test. Over the years, a misinterpretation has occurred between these two tests, the latter being confused with the first. To compare the Eichhoff's test with a new test, the wrist hyperflexion and abduction of the thumb test, we set up a prospective study over a period of three years for a cohort of 100 patients (88 women, 12 men) presenting spontaneous pain over the radial side of the styloid of the radius (de Quervain tendinopathy). The purpose of the study was to compare the accuracy of the Eichhoff's test and wrist hyperflexion and abduction of the thumb test to diagnose correctly de Quervain's disease by comparing clinical findings using those tests with the results on ultrasound. The wrist hyperflexion and abduction of the thumb test revealed greater sensitivity (0.99) and an improved specificity (0.29) together with a slightly better positive predictive value (0.95) and an improved negative predictive value (0.67). Moreover, the study showed us that the wrist hyperflexion and abduction of the thumb test is very valuable in diagnosing dynamic instability after successful decompression of the first extensor compartment. Our results support that the wrist hyperflexion and abduction of the thumb test is a more precise tool for the diagnosis of de Quervain's disease than the Eichhoff's test and thus could be adopted to guide clinical diagnosis in the early stages of de Quervain's tendinopathy.

Finkelstein's test is the classic diagnostic test for de Quervain's disease. Finkelstein hypothesized that the entry of the muscle bellies of the extensor pollicis brevis (EPB) and abductor pollicis longus (APL) tendons into the first extensor compartment was responsible for the findings observed in his now eponymous test. We agree with Finkelstein's hypothesis and further hypothesize that this position would induce measurable bulk (muscle mass within the retinaculum) and tethering (stretching of synovial tissue) effects within the compartment. To test this latter hypothesis we measured the excursion and gliding resistance of the EPB and APL tendons within the first compartment. Fifteen fresh-frozen cadavers were used. Gliding resistance and excursion were measured in 4 different wrist positions, including the wrist position of Finkelstein's test (30 degrees ulnar deviation). The bulk and tethering effect was calculated based on the mean gliding resistance over the tendon proximal/distal excursion cycle and the gliding resistance at the terminal distal excursion. The EPB tendon excursion was significantly more distal in 30 degrees ulnar deviation than in 60 degrees extension. Additionally the bulk and tethering resistance was significantly greater in 30 degrees ulnar deviation compared with 60 degrees extension. For the APL tendon there was no significant difference in either the tendon excursion or the bulk and tethering resistance between 30 degrees ulnar deviation and 60 degrees extension. We showed that in the position of Finkelstein's test the EPB tendon is significantly more distal and has significantly greater bulk and tethering effect compared with the other EPB positions. This is not the case for the APL tendon in the position of Finkelstein's test. These results suggest that an abnormal Finkelstein's test reflects differences of the EPB more than it does the APL.

The purpose of this study was to describe the technique and usefulness of ultrasound-guided intrasheath injection of triamcinolone in the treatment of de Quervain's disease (dQD). Our study was retrospective in design. Seventy-one wrists of 62 patients who were treated with an ultrasound-guided triamcinolone injection for dQD were included. A literature search was performed to compare our results. In the literature we found supportive evidence that accurate injection of triamcinolone in the first dorsal compartment of the wrist is important for a good outcome. In this retrospective study we found that treatment with ultrasound-guided injections of triamcinolone is both safe and effective. After two injections, 91% of the patients had good long-term results, which is a higher cure rate than found in most other studies. Furthermore, we found that Finkelstein's test can give a false positive result. Therefore, ultrasound should not only be considered to improve the treatment outcome, but can also be useful as a diagnostic tool in the management of de Quervain's disease.

The management of de Quervain's disease (DD) is nonoperative in the first instance, but surgery should be considered if conservative measures fail. We present the long-term results of operative treatment of DD. From July 1988 to July 1998, 94 consecutive patients with DD were treated operatively by a single surgeon. There were 80 women and 14 men. Average age at the time of operation was 47.4 years (range 22-76). The right wrist was involved in 43 cases, the left in 51 cases. All operations were done under tourniquet control with local infiltration anaesthesia using a longitudinal incision and partial resection of the extensor ligament. There were six perioperative complications, including one superficial wound infection, one delayed wound healing, and four transient lesions of the radial nerve. A successful outcome was achieved in all cases with negative Finkelstein's test. Simple decompression of both tendons and partial resection of the extensor ligament with a maximum of 3 mm can be recommended in operative treatment of DD with excellent long-term results.
