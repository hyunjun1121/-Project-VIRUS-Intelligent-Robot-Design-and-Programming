IDEAL_ANSWER:
- The LMNA gene is the most mutated gene in dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM) and affects approximately 25% of the patients.
- Mutations in the gene encoding lamin A/C (LMNA) cause dilated cardiomyopathy
- lamin a/c gene (lmna)
- The most mutated gene in dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM) is the lamin A/C gene. Mutations in this gene are responsible for the most common form of DCM and result in a recessive form of cardiac hypertrophy.  A compound heterozygous one amino-acid insertion/nonsense mutation in the plectin gene causes dilatedCardiac b-myosin heavy chain gene (LMNA) to be mutated in 25% of patients with DCM.
- Mutations in the lamin A/C gene (LMNA) may cause familial dilated cardiomyopathy (dilated cardiomyopathy)
- The most mutated gene in dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM) is the LMO2-binding protein (LMNA) gene. Mutations in the LMNA gene underlie both adult-onset and juvenile forms of DCM and result in very severe cardiac dysfunction.

EXACT_ANSWER:
- LMNA
- lamin A/C
