What is nyctinasty in plants?

[PMID: 17304541]
The chemical aspects of the circadian leaf movement known as "nyctinasty" are discussed in this paper. Each of the nyctinastic plants of five different genera so far examined contained a pair of factors, one of which induced leaf closure and another induced leaf opening. The relative contents of the closing and opening factors changed correlating with the nyctinastic leaf movement. The use of fluorescence-labeled and photoaffinity-labeled factors revealed that the factors bind to specific cells, the motor cells, present in the pulvini, and that the membrane fraction of the motor cells contained two proteins of 210 and 180 kDa, which can bind to the factors.

Periodic leaf-movement of legumes is called nyctinasty and has been known since the age of Alexander the Great. We found that nyctinasty is controlled by a periodic change of the internal concentration of leaf-opening and leaf-closing substances in the plant body. Now, we have developed novel fluorescent probes (1) based on the structure of cis-p-coumaroylagmatine (3), which was isolated as a leaf-opening substance of Albizzia juribrissin Durazz. Binding experiments using probe 1 showed that Albizza plants have receptors for a leaf-opening substance in their motor cells. By using probes 1 we then found that genus-specific receptors are involved in nyctinasty.

The circadian leaf opening and closing (nyctinasty) of Fabaceae has attracted scientists' attention since the era of Charles Darwin. Nyctinastic movement is triggered by the alternate swelling and shrinking of motor cells at the base of the leaf. This, in turn, is facilitated by changing osmotic pressures brought about by ion flow through anion and potassium ion channels. However, key regulatory ion channels and molecular mechanisms remain largely unknown. Here, we identify three key ion channels in mimosoid tree Samanea saman: the slow-type anion channels, SsSLAH1 and SsSLAH3, and the Shaker-type potassium channel, SPORK2. We show that cell-specific circadian expression of SsSLAH1 plays a key role in nyctinastic leaf opening. In addition, SsSLAH1 co-expressed with SsSLAH3 in flexor (abaxial) motor cells promoted leaf opening. We confirm the importance of SLAH1 in leaf movement using SLAH1-impaired Glycine max. Identification of this "master player" advances our molecular understanding of nyctinasty.

Foliar nyctinasty is a plant behaviour characterised by a pronounced daily oscillation in leaf orientation. During the day, the blades of nyctinastic plant leaves (or leaflets) assume a more or less horizontal position that optimises their ability to capture sunlight for photosynthesis. At night, the positions that the leaf blades assume, regardless of whether they arise by rising, falling or twisting, are essentially vertical. Among the ideas put forth to explain the raison d'Ãªtre of foliar nyctinasty are that it: (i) improves the temperature relations of plants; (ii) helps remove surface water from foliage; (iii) prevents the disruption of photoperiodism by moonlight; and (iv) directly discourages insect herbivory. After discussing these previous hypotheses, a novel tritrophic hypothesis is introduced that proposes that foliar nyctinasty constitutes an indirect plant defence against nocturnal herbivores. It is suggested that the reduction in physical clutter that follows from nocturnal leaf closure may increase the foraging success of many types of animals that prey upon or parasitise herbivores. Predators and parasitoids generally use some combination of visual, auditory or olfactory cues to detect prey. In terrestrial environments, it is hypothesised that the vertical orientation of the blades of nyctinastic plants at night would be especially beneficial to flying nocturnal predators (e.g. bats and owls) and parasitoids whose modus operandi is death from above. The movements of prey beneath a plant with vertically oriented foliage would be visually more obvious to gleaning or swooping predators under nocturnal or crepuscular conditions. Such predators could also detect sounds made by prey better without baffling layers of foliage overhead to damp and disperse the signal. Moreover, any volatiles released by the prey would diffuse more directly to the awaiting olfactory apparatus of the predators or parasitoids. In addition to facilitating the demise of herbivores by carnivores and parasitoids, foliar nyctinasty, much like the enhanced illumination of the full moon, may mitigate feeding by nocturnal herbivores by altering their foraging behaviour. Foliar nyctinasty could also provide a competitive advantage by encouraging herbivores, seeking more cover, to forage on or around non-nyctinastic species. As an added advantage, foliar nyctinasty, by decreasing the temperature between plants through its effects on re-radiation, may slow certain types of ectothermic herbivores making them more vulnerable to predation. Foliar nyctinasty also may not solely be a behavioural adaptation against folivores; by discouraging foraging by granivores, the inclusive fitness of nyctinastic plants may be increased.

Leguminous plants open their leaves during the daytime and close them at night as if sleeping, a type of movement that follows circadian rhythms, and is known as nyctinastic movement. This phenomenon is controlled by two endogenous bioactive substances that exhibit opposing activities: Leaf-Opening Factor (LOF), which opens the leaves, and Leaf-Closing Factor (LCF), which closes them. The authors have carried out chemical biological research using these bioactive substances as molecular probes in order to clarify the mechanisms of nyctinastic movement. Here, we report on the detection and identification of the target proteins of these compounds using original methodology.
