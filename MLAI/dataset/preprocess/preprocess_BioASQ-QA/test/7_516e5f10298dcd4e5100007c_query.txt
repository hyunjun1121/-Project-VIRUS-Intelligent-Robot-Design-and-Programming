Is cancer related to global DNA hypo or hypermethylation?

Cancer cells are characterized by a generalized disruption of the DNA methylation pattern involving an overall decrease in the level of 5-methylcytosine together with regional hypermethylation of particular CpG islands. The extent of both DNA hypomethylation and hypermethylation in the tumor cell is likely to reflect distinctive biological and clinical features, although no studies have addressed its concurrent analysis until now. DNA methylation profiles in sporadic colorectal carcinomas, synchronous adenoma-carcinoma pairs and their matching normal mucosa were analyzed by using the amplification of inter-methylated sites (AIMS) method. A total of 208 AIMS generated sequences were tagged and evaluated for differential methylation. Global indices of hypermethylation and hypomethylation were calculated. All tumors displayed altered patterns of DNA methylation in reference to normal tissue. On average, 24% of the tagged sequences were differentially methylated in the tumor in regard to the normal pair with an overall prevalence of hypomethylations to hypermethylations. Carcinomas exhibited higher levels of hypermethylation than did adenomas but similar levels of hypomethylation. Indices of hypomethylation and hypermethylation showed independent correlations with patient's sex, tumor staging and specific gene hypermethylation. Hierarchical cluster analysis revealed two main patterns of DNA methylation that were associated to particular mutational spectra in the K-ras and the p53 genes and alternative correlates of hypomethylation and hypermethylation with survival. We conclude that DNA hypermethylation and hypomethylation are independent processes and appear to play different roles in colorectal tumor progression. Subgroups of colorectal tumors show specific genetic and epigenetic signatures and display distinctive correlates with overall survival.

Extensive changes in DNA methylation are common in cancer and may contribute to oncogenesis through transcriptional silencing of tumor-suppressor genes. Genome-scale studies have yielded important insights into these changes but have focused on CpG islands or gene promoters. We used whole-genome bisulfite sequencing (bisulfite-seq) to comprehensively profile a primary human colorectal tumor and adjacent normal colon tissue at single-basepair resolution. Regions of focal hypermethylation in the tumor were located primarily at CpG islands and were concentrated within regions of long-range (>100 kb) hypomethylation. These hypomethylated domains covered nearly half of the genome and coincided with late replication and attachment to the nuclear lamina in human cell lines. We confirmed the confluence of hypermethylation and hypomethylation within these domains in 25 diverse colorectal tumors and matched adjacent tissue. We propose that widespread DNA methylation changes in cancer are linked to silencing programs orchestrated by the three-dimensional organization of chromatin within the nucleus.

We analyzed DNA methyltransferase (Dnmt) protein expression and DNA methylation patterns during four progressive stages of prostate cancer in the transgenic adenocarcinoma of mouse prostate (TRAMP) model, including prostatic intraepithelial neoplasia, well-differentiated tumors, early poorly differentiated tumors, and late poorly differentiated tumors. Dnmt1, Dnmt3a, and Dnmt3b protein expression were increased in all stages; however, after normalization to cyclin A to account for cell cycle regulation, Dnmt proteins remained overexpressed in prostatic intraepithelial neoplasia and well-differentiated tumors, but not in poorly differentiated tumors. Restriction landmark genomic scanning analysis of locus-specific methylation revealed a high incidence of hypermethylation only in poorly differentiated (early and late) tumors. Several genes identified by restriction landmark genomic scanning showed hypermethylation of downstream regions correlating with mRNA overexpression, including p16INK4a, p19ARF, and Cacna1a. Parallel gene expression and DNA methylation analyses suggests that gene overexpression precedes downstream hypermethylation during prostate tumor progression. In contrast to gene hypermethylation, genomic DNA hypomethylation, including hypomethylation of repetitive elements and loss of genomic 5-methyldeoxycytidine, occurred in both early and late stages of prostate cancer. DNA hypermethylation and DNA hypomethylation did not correlate in TRAMP, and Dnmt protein expression did not correlate with either variable, with the exception of a borderline significant association between Dnmt1 expression and DNA hypermethylation. In summary, our data reveal the relative timing of and relationship between key alterations of the DNA methylation pathway occurring during prostate tumor progression in an in vivo model system.

CpG island hypermethylation and genomic DNA hypomethylation are found not only in gastric cancers but also in associated premalignant lesions. Helicobacter pylori infection induces aberrant CpG island hypermethylation in gastric mucosae. However, little is known about the relationship between H. pylori infection and aberrant methylation in premalignant lesions. The present study characterized methylation changes in a subset of genes and repetitive DNA elements (ALU, LINE-1, SAT2) and examined their relationship with H. pylori infection in premalignant lesions of gastric cancers. We performed MethyLight analysis of 25 genes and SAT2 and COBRA analysis of ALU and LINE-1 in 212 gastric tissue samples. H. pylori infection was closely associated with enhanced hypermethylation of CpG island loci in chronic gastritis samples, but this association was not found among intestinal metaplasias, gastric adenomas and gastric cancers. The number of methylated genes was greater in intestinal metaplasia and gastric adenoma samples than in chronic gastritis samples, regardless of H. pylori infection. Methylation of repetitive DNA elements in gastric lesions generally decreased with progression of the gastric lesion along the multistep carcinogenesis. No difference was noted in the number of methylated genes in chronic gastritis or intestinal metaplasia between gastric cancer patients and non-cancer subjects. In conclusion, we found that there was no enhanced CpG island hypermethylation in gastric cancer and premalignant lesions in association with H. pylori infection and our findings suggest that CpG island hypermethylation and repetitive DNA hypomethylation are enhanced with progression of the gastric lesion through the multistep carcinogenesis, regardless of the status of H. pylori infection.

NBL2 is a tandem 1.4-kb DNA repeat, whose hypomethylation in hepatocellular carcinomas was shown previously to be an independent predictor of disease progression. Here, we examined methylation of all cytosine residues in a 0.2-kb subregion of NBL2 in ovarian carcinomas, Wilms' tumors, and diverse control tissues by hairpin-bisulfite PCR. This new genomic sequencing method detects 5-methylcytosine on covalently linked complementary strands of a DNA fragment. All DNA clones from normal somatic tissues displayed symmetrical methylation at seven CpG positions and no methylation or only hemimethylation at two others. Unexpectedly, 56% of cancer DNA clones had decreased methylation at some normally methylated CpG sites as well as increased methylation at one or both of the normally unmethylated sites. All 146 DNA clones from 10 cancers could be distinguished from all 91 somatic control clones by assessing methylation changes at three of these CpG sites. The special involvement of DNA methyltransferase 3B in NBL2 methylation was indicated by analysis of cells from immunodeficiency, centromeric region instability, and facial anomalies syndrome patients who have mutations in the gene encoding DNA methyltransferase 3B. Blot hybridization of 33 cancer DNAs digested with CpG methylation-sensitive enzymes confirmed that NBL2 arrays are unusually susceptible to cancer-linked hypermethylation and hypomethylation, consistent with our novel genomic sequencing findings. The combined Southern blot and genomic sequencing data indicate that some of the cancer-linked alterations in CpG methylation are occurring with considerable sequence specificity. NBL2 is an attractive candidate for an epigenetic cancer marker and for elucidating the nature of epigenetic changes in cancer.

Hypomethylation of CpG dinucleotides in genomic DNA was one of the first somatic epigenetic alterations discovered in human cancers. DNA hypomethylation is postulated to occur very early in almost all human cancers, perhaps facilitating genetic instability and cancer initiation and progression. We therefore examined the nature, extent, and timing of DNA hypomethylation changes in human prostate cancer. Contrary to the prevailing view that global DNA hypomethylation changes occur extremely early in all human cancers, we show that reductions in (5me)C content in the genome occur very late in prostate cancer progression, appearing at a significant extent only at the stage of metastatic disease. Furthermore, we found that, whereas some LINE1 promoter hypomethylation does occur in primary prostate cancers compared with normal tissues, this LINE1 hypomethylation is significantly more pronounced in metastatic prostate cancer. Next, we carried out a tiered gene expression microarray and bisulfite genomic sequencing-based approach to identify genes that are silenced by CpG island methylation in normal prostate cells but become overexpressed in prostate cancer cells as a result of CpG island hypomethylation. Through this analysis, we show that a class of cancer testis antigen genes undergoes CpG island hypomethylation and overexpression in primary prostate cancers, but more so in metastatic prostate cancers. Finally, we show that DNA hypomethylation patterns are quite heterogeneous across different metastatic sites within the same patients. These findings provide evidence that DNA hypomethylation changes occur later in prostate carcinogenesis than the CpG island hypermethylation changes and occur heterogeneously during prostate cancer progression and metastatic dissemination.

Changes in DNA methylation patterns are an important characteristic of human cancer. Tumors have reduced levels of genomic DNA methylation and contain hypermethylated CpG islands, but the full extent and sequence context of DNA hypomethylation and hypermethylation is unknown. Here, we used methylated CpG island recovery assay-assisted high-resolution genomic tiling and CpG island arrays to analyze methylation patterns in lung squamous cell carcinomas and matched normal lung tissue. Normal tissues from different individuals showed overall very similar DNA methylation patterns. Each tumor contained several hundred hypermethylated CpG islands. We identified and confirmed 11 CpG islands that were methylated in 80-100% of the SCC tumors, and many hold promise as effective biomarkers for early detection of lung cancer. In addition, we find that extensive DNA hypomethylation in tumors occurs specifically at repetitive sequences, including short and long interspersed nuclear elements and LTR elements, segmental duplications, and subtelomeric regions, but single-copy sequences rarely become demethylated. The results are consistent with a specific defect in methylation of repetitive DNA sequences in human cancer.
