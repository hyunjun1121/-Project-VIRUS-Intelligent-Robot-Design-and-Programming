Burosumab (Crysvita<sup>®</sup>; Kyowa Hakko Kirin Co., Ltd. and Ultragenyx Pharmaceutical Inc.) is a fully human monoclonal antibody directed at fibroblast growth factor 23 (FGF23). Excessive FGF23 production has been implicated in various hypophosphataemic diseases. Inhibition of FGF23 by burosumab results in increased renal phosphate reabsorption and increased serum levels of phosphorus and active vitamin D. In February 2018, the EMA granted subcutaneous burosumab conditional marketing authorization for the treatment of X-linked hypophosphataemia (XLH) with radiographic evidence of bone disease in children one year of age and older and adolescents with growing skeletons. In April 2018, the US FDA approved burosumab for the treatment of XLH in adults and children one year of age and older. Multinational phase III trials of burosumab are currently underway in adult and paediatric patients with XLH. Burosumab is also being evaluated in the phase II setting in adults with tumour-induced osteomalacia and epidermal nevus syndrome in the USA, as well as in Japan and Korea. This article summarizes the milestones in the development of burosumab leading to its first global approval in the EU for XLH in paediatric patients.

Burosumab (Crysvita<sup>®</sup>), a fully human IgG1 monoclonal antibody directed at fibroblast growth factor 23 (FGF23), is indicated for the treatment of X-linked hypophosphatemia (XLH), a condition associated with excessive FGF23 production. It directly addresses the excessive FGF23 activity in patients with XLH by binding to FGF23, and inhibiting its signaling. This leads to increased gastrointestinal phosphate absorption and renal phosphate reabsorption, thereby improving serum phosphate levels, and, ultimately, bone mineralization and the risk of bone disease. In clinical trials, subcutaneous burosumab increased serum phosphorus levels in pediatric and adult patients with XLH, as well as significantly improving the severity of rickets in children, and improving pain, stiffness, physical functioning, and fracture/pseudofracture healing in adults. Burosumab is well tolerated by children and adults with XLH, with most treatment-emergent adverse events being of mild to moderate severity.

Fibroblast growth factor 23(FGF23)is a phosphaturic hormone, and its excess causes several kinds of congenital and acquired hypophosphatemic diseases. A combination of oral active vitamin D3 and phosphate salt is the current standard therapy for patients with FGF23-related hypophosphatemic rickets and osteomalacia. However, these medications may cause long-term complications, such as secondary hyperparathyroidism and chronic kidney disease. Therefore, an anti-FGF23 neutralizing antibody that blocks FGF23 activity has been produced. X-linked hypophosphatemic rickets(XLHR)is the most prevalent form of hereditary FGF23-related hypophosphatemia. The safety and efficacy of a human anti-FGF23 antibody, KRN23 or burosumab, has been confirmed in adults and children with XLHR. Moreover, Burosumab is being tested as a potential treatment for patients with tumor-induced osteomalacia(TIO), which is the most prevalent form of acquired FGF23-related hypophosphatemia.

The most common heritable disorder of renal phosphate wasting, X-linked hypophosphataemia (XLH), was discovered to be caused by inactivating mutations in the phosphate regulating gene with homology to endopeptidases on the X-chromosome (PHEX) gene in 1995. Although the exact molecular mechanisms by which PHEX mutations cause disturbed phosphate handling in XLH remain unknown, focus for novel therapies has more recently been based upon the finding that the bone-produced phosphaturic hormone fibroblast growth factor-23 is elevated in XLH patient plasma. Previous treatment strategies for XLH were based upon phosphate repletion plus active vitamin D analogues, which are difficult to manage, fail to address the primary pathogenesis of the disease, and can have deleterious side effects. A novel therapy for XLH directly targeting fibroblast growth factor-23 via a humanized monoclonal antibody (burosumab-twza/CRYSVITA, henceforth referred to just as burosumab) has emerged as an effective, and recently approved, pharmacological treatment for both children and adults. This review will provide an overview of the clinical manifestations of XLH, the molecular pathophysiology, and summarize its current treatment.

X-linked hypophosphatemia is characterized by increased secretion of fibroblast growth factor 23 (FGF-23), which leads to hypophosphatemia and consequently rickets, osteomalacia, and skeletal deformities. We investigated burosumab, a monoclonal antibody that targets FGF-23, in patients with X-linked hypophosphatemia. In an open-label, phase 2 trial, we randomly assigned 52 children with X-linked hypophosphatemia, in a 1:1 ratio, to receive subcutaneous burosumab either every 2 weeks or every 4 weeks; the dose was adjusted to achieve a serum phosphorus level at the low end of the normal range. The primary end point was the change from baseline to weeks 40 and 64 in the Thacher rickets severity total score (ranging from 0 to 10, with higher scores indicating greater disease severity). In addition, the Radiographic Global Impression of Change was used to evaluate rachitic changes from baseline to week 40 and to week 64. Additional end points were changes in pharmacodynamic markers, linear growth, physical ability, and patient-reported outcomes and the incidence of adverse events. The mean Thacher rickets severity total score decreased from 1.9 at baseline to 0.8 at week 40 with every-2-week dosing and from 1.7 at baseline to 1.1 at week 40 with every-4-week dosing (P<0.001 for both comparisons); these improvements persisted at week 64. The mean serum phosphorus level increased after the first dose in both groups, and more than half the patients in both groups had levels within the normal range (3.2 to 6.1 mg per deciliter [1.0 to 2.0 mmol per liter]) by week 6. Stable serum phosphorus levels were maintained through week 64 with every-2-week dosing. Renal tubular phosphate reabsorption increased from baseline in both groups, with an overall mean increase of 0.98 mg per deciliter (0.32 mmol per liter). The mean dose of burosumab at week 40 was 0.98 mg per kilogram of body weight with every-2-week dosing and 1.50 mg per kilogram with every-4-week dosing. Across both groups, the mean serum alkaline phosphatase level decreased from 459 U per liter at baseline to 369 U per liter at week 64. The mean standing-height z score increased in both groups, with greater improvement seen at all time points with every-2-week dosing (an increase from baseline of 0.19 at week 64) than with every-4-week dosing (an increase from baseline of 0.12 at week 64). Physical ability improved and pain decreased. Nearly all the adverse events were mild or moderate in severity. In children with X-linked hypophosphatemia, treatment with burosumab improved renal tubular phosphate reabsorption, serum phosphorus levels, linear growth, and physical function and reduced pain and the severity of rickets.

Phosphate plays essential roles in many biological processes, and the serum phosphate level is tightly controlled. Chronic hypophosphatemia causes impaired mineralization of the bone matrix and results in rickets and osteomalacia. Fibroblast growth factor 23 (FGF23) is a bone-derived hormone that regulates phosphate metabolism. FGF23 excess induces hypophosphatemia via impaired phosphate reabsorption in the renal proximal tubules and decreased phosphate absorption in the intestines. There are several types of genetic and acquired FGF23-related hypophosphatemic diseases. Among these diseases, X-linked hypophosphatemia (XLH), which is caused by inactivating mutations in the phosphate-regulating endopeptidase homolog, X-linked (PHEX) gene, is the most prevalent form of genetic FGF23-related hypophosphatemic rickets. Another clinically relevant form of FGF23-related hypophosphatemic disease is tumor-induced osteomalacia (TIO), a paraneoplastic syndrome associated with FGF23-producing tumors. A combination of active vitamin D and phosphate salts is the current medical therapy used to treat patients with XLH and inoperative TIO. However, this therapy has certain efficacy- and safety-associated limitations. Several measures to inhibit FGF23 activity have been considered as possible new treatments for FGF23-related hypophosphatemic diseases. In particular, a humanized monoclonal antibody for FGF23 (burosumab) is a promising treatment in patients with XLH and TIO. This review will focus on the phosphate metabolism and the pathogenesis and treatment of FGF23-related hypophosphatemic diseases.

In X-linked hypophosphatemia (XLH), inherited loss-of-function mutations in the PHEX gene cause excess circulating levels of fibroblast growth factor 23 (FGF23), leading to lifelong renal phosphate wasting and hypophosphatemia. Adults with XLH present with chronic musculoskeletal pain and stiffness, short stature, lower limb deformities, fractures, and pseudofractures due to osteomalacia, accelerated osteoarthritis, dental abscesses, and enthesopathy. Burosumab, a fully human monoclonal antibody, binds and inhibits FGF23 to correct hypophosphatemia. This report summarizes results from a double-blind, placebo-controlled, phase 3 trial of burosumab in symptomatic adults with XLH. Participants with hypophosphatemia and pain were assigned 1:1 to burosumab 1 mg/kg (n = 68) or placebo (n = 66) subcutaneously every 4 weeks (Q4W) and were comparable at baseline. Across midpoints of dosing intervals, 94.1% of burosumab-treated participants attained mean serum phosphate concentration above the lower limit of normal compared with 7.6% of those receiving placebo (p < 0.001). Burosumab significantly reduced the Western Ontario and the McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis Index (WOMAC) stiffness subscale compared with placebo (least squares [LS] mean ± standard error [SE] difference, -8.1 ± 3.24; p = 0.012). Reductions in WOMAC physical function subscale (-4.9 ± 2.48; p = 0.048) and Brief Pain Inventory worst pain (-0.5 ± 0.28; p = 0.092) did not achieve statistical significance after Hochberg multiplicity adjustment. At week 24, 43.1% (burosumab) and 7.7% (placebo) of baseline active fractures were fully healed; the odds of healed fracture in the burosumab group was 16.8-fold greater than that in the placebo group (p < 0.001). Biochemical markers of bone formation and resorption increased significantly from baseline with burosumab treatment compared with placebo. The safety profile of burosumab was similar to placebo. There were no treatment-related serious adverse events or meaningful changes from baseline in serum or urine calcium, intact parathyroid hormone, or nephrocalcinosis. These data support the conclusion that burosumab is a novel therapeutic addressing an important medical need in adults with XLH.© 2018 The Authors.
