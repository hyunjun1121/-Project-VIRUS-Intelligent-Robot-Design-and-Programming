Studies on oocyte transcriptome are important to understand the biological pathways involved in oogenesis, totipotence and early embryonic development. Moreover, genes regulating physiological pathways in gametes could represent potential candidates for reproductive disorders. In addition to oocyte specific transcription factors, also the members of the p53 family could be etiologically involved due to their biological functions. In fact, their role in the control of cell cycle, apoptosis, and germ-line genome stability is well known. Female reproductive aging is one of the causes of fertility reduction and it is often associated with egg aneuploidy increase. In order to verify the potential involvement of p73 in reproductive aging, we determined its expression in single mature MII oocytes from two groups of women, younger than 35 or older than 38 years, respectively. We found that TAp73 isoforms are down regulated in oocytes from women older than 38 years. We confirmed these data in pools of mouse oocytes. TAp73 down regulation in oocytes from women of advanced reproductive age could explain both the reduction of fertility and the increase of newborns with chromosomal abnormalities.

p73 is expressed as TA and ΔN isoforms, both of which are implicated in tumor suppression and/or promotion. To address how p73 possesses these opposing functions, we developed three-dimensional culture of MCF10A cells, which undergo cell morphogenesis to form polarized spheroids with hollow lumen similar to normal mammary acini in vivo. Here, we showed that upon knockdown of p73, particularly TAp73 but not ΔNp73, MCF10A cells formed irregular and near-normal acini without hollow lumen in three-dimensional culture. We also found that upon knockdown of p73 or TAp73, but not ΔNp73, MCF10A cells underwent epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT) via down-regulation of E-cadherin coupled with up-regulation of β-catenin and laminin V. In addition, we found that Snail-1, Slug, and Twist, all of which are known to act as EMT inducers by repressing E-cadherin expression, were increased markedly upon knockdown of p73 and TAp73 but little if any by ΔNp73. Furthermore, we showed that knockdown of p73 or TAp73 in MCF10A cells led to a marked increase in cell proliferation and migration. Together, our data suggest that TAp73 is necessary for maintaining normal cell polarity by suppressing EMT.

The role of various p73 isoforms in tumorigenesis has been controversial. However, as we have recently shown, the generation of TAp73-deficient (TAp73(-/-)) mice reveals that TAp73 isoforms exert tumor-suppressive functions, indicating an emerging role for Trp-73 in the maintenance of genomic stability. Unlike mice lacking all p73 isoforms, TAp73(-/-) mice show a high incidence of spontaneous tumors. Moreover, TAp73(-/-) mice are infertile and produce oocytes exhibiting spindle abnormalities. These data suggest a link between TAp73 activities and the common molecular machinery underlying meiosis and mitosis. Previous studies have indicated that the spindle assembly checkpoint (SAC) complex, whose activation leads to mitotic arrest, also regulates meiosis. In this study, we demonstrate in murine and human cells that TAp73 is able to interact directly with several partners of the SAC complex (Bub1, Bub3, and BubR1). We also show that TAp73 is involved in SAC protein localization and activities. Moreover, we show that decreased TAp73 expression correlates with increases of SAC protein expression in patients with lung cancer. Our results establish TAp73 as a regulator of SAC responses and indicate that TAp73 loss can lead to mitotic arrest defects. Our data suggest that SAC impairment in the absence of functional TAp73 could explain the genomic instability and increased aneuploidy observed in TAp73-deficient cells.

p73 is a p53 family transcription factor. Due to the presence in the 5' flanking region of two promoters, there are two N-terminal variants, TAp73, which retains a fully active transactivation domain (TA), and ΔNp73, in which the N terminus is truncated. In addition, extensive 3' splicing gives rise to at least seven distinctive isoforms; TAp73-selective knockout highlights its role as a regulator of cell death, senescence and tumor suppressor. ΔNp73-selective knockout, on the other hand, highlights anti-apoptotic function of ΔNp73 and its involvement in DNA damage response. In this work, we investigated the expression pattern of murine p73 C-terminal isoforms. By using a RT-PCR approach, we were able to detect mRNAs of all the C-terminal isoforms described in humans. We characterized their in vivo expression profile in mouse organs and in different mouse developmental stages. Finally, we investigated p73 C-terminal expression profile following DNA damage, ex vivo after primary cultures treatment and in vivo after systemic administration of cytotoxic compounds. Overall, our study first elucidates spatio-temporal expression of mouse p73 isoforms and provides novel insights on their expression-switch under triggered conditions.

P73 is a member of the p53 transcription factors family with a prominent role in neurobiology, affecting brain development as well as controlling neuronal survival. Accordingly, p73 has been identified as key player in many age-related neurodegenerative diseases, such as Alzheimer's disease, neuroAIDS and Niemann-Pick type C disease. Here we investigate possible correlations of p73 with Parkinson disease. Tyrosine hydroxylase is a crucial player in Parkinson disease being the enzyme necessary for dopamine synthesis. In this work we show that levels of tyrosine hydroxylase can be influenced by p73. We also demonstrate that p73 can protect against tyrosine hydroxylase depletion in an in vitro model of Parkinson disease.

Cumulative data support the role of ΔTAp73 variants in tumorigenic processes such as drug resistance. We evaluate the impact of TP73 isoforms and their putative target genes ABCB1, HMGB1, and CASP1 on the survival of colon cancer patients and the correlation between their expressions. We determined in 77 colon cancer patients the expression of ΔEx2p73, ΔEx2/3p73, ΔNp73, TAp73, ABCB1, HMGB1, and CASP1 by quantitative real-time reverse transcriptase-PCR. Tumor characteristics, disease-free survival, and overall survival (OS) were examined in each patient. Functional experiments were carried out to check whether ectopic expression of ΔNp73 modifies the proliferation, drug resistance, migration, and invasion properties of colon tumor cells and the expression of ABCB1, HMGB1, and CASP1. Positive correlations were observed between the expression levels of ΔTAp73 variants and HMGB1. Furthermore, a trend was observed for ABCB1. Overexpression of ΔEx2/3p73 and ΔNp73 isoforms was significantly associated with advanced stages (P = 0.04 and P = 0.03, respectively) and predicted shortened OS (P = 0.04 and P = 0.05, respectively). High levels of ABCB1 and HMGB1 were associated with shorter OS (P = 0.04 and P = 0.05, respectively). Multivariate analysis showed that, in addition to the tumor stage, ABCB1 and HMGB1 had independent relationships with OS (P = 0.008). Ectopic expression of ΔNp73 was associated with an increase in proliferation and drug resistance. The positive correlation between ΔTAp73 variants and HMGB1 and ABCB1 expression supports them as TP73 targets. The fact that upregulation of ΔTAp73 isoforms was associated with shortened OS, increase in proliferation, and drug resistance confirms their oncogenic role and plausible value as prognostic markers. ABCB1 and HMGB1, putative ΔTAp73 target genes, strongly predict OS in an independent manner, making clear the importance of studying downstream TP73 targets that could predict the outcome of colon cancer patients better than ΔTAp73 variants themselves do.

Molecular regulation of p73, a p53 family member, remains unclear. Here we report that p73 expression is significantly regulated by cell densities. In particular, we found that p73alpha and p73beta are differentially regulated. While p73beta protein levels were inversely correlated with cell densities, p73alpha protein levels behaved oppositely. We further showed that density-dependent changes of p73alpha follow the same patterns as E2F-1 and TAp73 mRNA levels, suggesting transcriptional regulation. Our data also suggest that high levels of p73beta at lower densities may be due to increased protein stability. However, AIP-4/Itch appeared not to be involved in downregulation of p73beta at high densities. Moreover, we also found that subcellular location of p73 isoforms changes with the culture density increases. While high level of p73beta at low density was mainly presented in the nucleus, low levels of this protein at high densities were mainly in the cytosol. Taken together, these findings reveal a novel mechanism that differentially regulates p73 isoforms and underscores the role of cell-cell interaction in p73 regulation, which may advance our understanding of p73 expression and function in human cancers.

p73 is a p53-related transcription factor with fundamental roles in development and tumor suppression. Transcription from two different promoters on the p73 gene results in generation of transcriptionally active TAp73 isoforms and dominant negative DeltaNp73 isoforms with opposing pro- and anti-apoptotic functions. Therefore, the relative ratio of each isoform is an important determinant of the cell fate. Proteasomal degradation of p73 is mediated by polyubiquitination-dependent and -independent processes both of which appear, thus far, to lack selectivity for the TAp73 and DeltaNp73 isoforms. Here, we describe the characterization of another transcriptional target of TAp73; a ring finger domain ubiquitin ligase p73 Induced RING 2 protein (PIR2). Although PIR2 was initially identified a p53-induced gene (p53RFP), low abundance of PIR2 transcript in mouse embryonic fibroblasts of TAp73 KO mice compared with WT mice and comparison of PIR2 mRNA and protein levels following TAp73 or p53 overexpression substantiate TAp73 isoforms as strong inducers of PIR2. Although PIR2 expression was induced by DNA damage, its expression did not alter apoptotic response or cell cycle profile per se. However, coexpression of PIR2 with TAp73 or DeltaNp73 resulted in an increase of the TA/DeltaNp73 ratio, due to preferential degradation of DeltaNp73. Finally, PIR2 was able to relieve the inhibitory effect of DeltaNp73 on TAp73 induced apoptosis following DNA damage. These results suggest that PIR2, by being induced by TAp73 and degrading DeltaNp73, differentially regulates TAp73/DeltaNp73 stability, and, hence, it may offer a therapeutic approach to enhance the chemosensitivity of tumor cells.

p73 possesses an extrinsic P1 promoter and an intrinsic P2 promoter controlling the expression of the pro-apoptotic TAp73 isoforms and the anti-apoptotic ΔΝp73 isoforms respectively. In this study, we investigated the DNA methylation status of both promoters as a means of epigenetic transcriptional control of their corresponding isoforms in 102 primary non-small cell lung carcinomas (NSCLCs). We demonstrated that while P1 hypermethylation-associated reduction of TAp73 mRNA levels is relatively infrequent, the P2 hypomethylation-associated over-expression of ΔΝp73 mRNA is a frequent event, particularly among squamous cell carcinomas. P2 hypomethylation strongly correlated with LINE-1 element hypomethylation, indicating that ΔΝp73 over-expression may be a passive consequence of global DNA hypomethylation.

The transcription factor p73 belongs to the p53 family of tumour suppressors and similar to other family members, transcribed as different isoforms with opposing pro- and anti-apoptotic functions. Unlike p53, p73 mutations are extremely rare in cancers. Instead, the pro-apoptotic activities of transcriptionally active p73 isoforms are commonly inhibited by over-expression of the dominant negative p73 isoforms. Therefore the relative ratio of different p73 isoforms is critical for the cellular response to a chemotherapeutic agent. Here, we analysed the expression of N-terminal p73 isoforms in cell lines and mouse tissues. Our data showed that the transcriptionally competent TAp73 isoform is abundantly expressed in cancer cell lines compared to the dominant negative ΔNp73 isoform. Interestingly, we detected higher levels of ΔNp73 in some mouse tissues, suggesting that ΔNp73 may have a physiological role in these tissues.

The p73 gene is a p53 homologue that induces apoptosis and inhibits cell proliferation. N-terminal truncated isoforms of p73 (DeltaNp73) act as dominant-negative inhibitors of wild-type p53 and TAp73 and result in tumour growth in nude mice. To detect DeltaNp73 expression in 24 benign prostatic hyperplasia samples, 33 prostate carcinomas, and five normal samples and to evaluate the relation between DeltaNp73, TAp73 concentrations, and the clinicopathological characteristics of patients with prostate cancer. TAp73 was determined by real time polymerase chain reaction (PCR); DeltaNp73 and DeltaN'p73 were assessed using reverse transcription PCR. western blotting was used to analyse protein expression. p53 mutation was determined by immunohistochemistry. A significant increase of DeltaNp73 was seen in 20 of 33 carcinomas and 17 of 24 benign prostate hyperplasia tissues, but in none of the normal samples. None of the specimens expressed DeltaN'p73. No significant relation was found between TAp73 expression and clinical parameters. The incidence of positive expression of DeltaNp73 correlated with the Gleason score in prostate carcinomas. Cancer samples with wild-type p53 had significantly higher expression of DeltaNp73 than p53 mutant cancers. These data suggest a potential role for DeltaNp73 in prostate cancer progression.

Hepatitis B virus (HBV) is a causative agent of chronic hepatitis and hepatocellular carcinoma. Recent findings demonstrating p73 and specifically N-terminally truncated p73 (DeltaTAp73) accumulation in hepatocellular carcinoma suggest that p73 plays a role in the malignant phenotype. Here, we investigated the mechanism of HBV pregenomic core promoter/enhancer II (cp/EII) regulation by full-length TAp73 and its oncogenic counterpart DeltaTAp73. Ectopic and endogenous expression of TAp73 leads to a significant downregulation of cp/EII activity in p53-deficient hepatoma cell lines. In contrast, overexpression of DeltaTAp73 results in significant cp/EII activation and increased HBV core (HBc) expression. TAp73-mediated repression of HBV transcription was substantially abolished by DeltaTAp73. We show that both TAp73 and DeltaTAp73 proteins directly bind to the Sp1 transcription factor, a key stimulator of HBV gene expression. However, only TAp73 abolishes Sp1 binding to cp/EII, whereas the DeltaTAp73-Sp1 complex further persists on the DNA. The inhibitory effect of p53/p73 on HBc expression is associated with the inhibition of viral replication, while DeltaTAp73 is not. These data strongly support the fact that the p73-isoform-related interaction with Sp1 is the underlying mechanism of the diverse outcome on HBc expression, suggesting a new mechanism by which oncogenic DeltaTAp73 could enhance the carcinogenic process in liver cells.

Despite strong homology, the roles of TP53 and TP73 in tumorigenesis seem to be fundamentally different. In contrast to TP53, tumor-associated overexpression of TP73 in many different cancers, combined with virtual absence of inactivating mutations and lack of a cancer phenotype in the TP73 null mouse are inconsistent with a suppressor function but instead support an oncogenic function. The discovery of NH(2)-terminally truncated p73 isoforms, collectively called DeltaTAp73, is now the focus of intense interest because they act as potent transdominant inihibitors of wild-type p53 and transactivation-competent TAp73. Therefore, establishing deregulated DeltaTAp73 expression in tumors could be the crucial link to decipher which of the two opposing roles of this bipolar gene is the biologically relevant one. This study is the largest to date and encompasses 100 ovarian carcinomas with complete expression profile of all NH(2)-terminal isoforms, discriminating between TAp73 and DeltaTAp73 (DeltaNp73, DeltaN'p73, Ex2p73, and Ex2/3p73) by isoform-specific real-time reverse transcription-PCR. We find that the set of NH(2)-terminal p73 isoforms distinguishes ovarian cancer patients from healthy controls and thus is a molecular marker for this diagnosis. Ovarian cancers strongly and almost universally overexpress DeltaN'p73 compared with normal tissues (95% of cancers). About one-third of tumors also exhibit concomitant up-regulation of the antagonistic TAp73, whereas only a small subgroup of tumors overexpress DeltaNp73. Thus, deregulation of the E2F1-responsive P1 promoter, rather than the alternate P2 promoter, is mainly responsible for the production of transdominant p53/TAp73 antagonists in ovarian cancer. Tumor stage, grade, presence of metastases, p53 status, and residual disease after resection are significant prognostic markers for overall and recurrence-free survival. A trend is found for better overall survival in patients with low expression of DeltaN'p73/DeltaNp73, compared with patients with high expression. A strong correlation between deregulated DeltaTAp73 and p53 status exists. p53 wild-type cancers exhibit significantly higher deregulation of DeltaN'p73, DeltaNp73, and Ex2/3p73 than p53 mutant cancers. This data strongly supports the hypothesis that overexpression of transdominant p73 isoforms can function as epigenetic inhibitors of p53 in vivo, thereby alleviating selection pressure for p53 mutations in tumors.

p73 has significant homology to p53. However, tumor-associated up-regulation of p73 and genetic data from human tumors and p73-deficient mice exclude a classical Knudson-type tumor suppressor role. We report that the human TP73 gene generates an NH(2) terminally truncated isoform. DeltaNp73 derives from an alternative promoter in intron 3 and lacks the transactivation domain of full-length TAp73. DeltaNp73 is frequently overexpressed in a variety of human cancers, but not in normal tissues. DeltaNp73 acts as a potent transdominant inhibitor of wild-type p53 and transactivation-competent TAp73. DeltaNp73 efficiently counteracts transactivation function, apoptosis, and growth suppression mediated by wild-type p53 and TAp73, and confers drug resistance to wild-type p53 harboring tumor cells. Conversely, down-regulation of endogenous DeltaNp73 levels by antisense methods alleviates its suppressive action and enhances p53- and TAp73-mediated apoptosis. DeltaNp73 is complexed with wild-type p53, as demonstrated by coimmunoprecipitation from cultured cells and primary tumors. Thus, DeltaNp73 mediates a novel inactivation mechanism of p53 and TAp73 via a dominant-negative family network. Deregulated expression of DeltaNp73 can bestow oncogenic activity upon the TP73 gene by functionally inactivating the suppressor action of p53 and TAp73. This trait might be selected for in human cancers.

p53, p63 and p73 make a family of transcription factors that play a vital role in development and cancer. All p53 family members have more than one promoter producing Transactivating (TA) and Dominant Negative (DeltaN) isoforms and their mRNAs are subjected to extensive splicing at 3' end to produce multiple protein products. p53 is usually inactivated by point mutations during tumorigenesis, whereas the expression levels and p63 and p73 are modulated to give tumor cells a selective advantage. In this study, aiming to find novel targets of the p53 family members, we identified FGFR3 as a gene transcriptionally controlled by p63 and p73. FGFR3 has been implicated in development and tumor biology as activating mutations of this gene was described in skeletal disorders, non-invasive skin conditions and superficial bladder cancers. We found that TAp73, TAp63 and DeltaNp63 was capable of inducing FGFR3. siRNA mediated downregulation of DeltaNp63 decreased endogenous FGFR3 protein levels. Our findings of this new link between p53 family proteins and FGFR3 may help understanding the transition of superficial bladder cancers to an invasive phenotype.

The TP73 gene, a member of the p53 family, due to the use of different promoters and alternative splicing, is transcribed into different isoforms with contrasting attributes and which contribute to its functional diversity. Considerable efforts are made to identify the functional diversity of the p73 splicing variants during tumorigenesis. TAp73α and TAp73β isoforms have been shown to differentially regulate cell cycle progression, differentiation and apoptosis. Interestingly, a particular increase in expression of the TAp73 isoform, in favor of the α splicing variant, has been reported in multiple tumour types. Here, we report a distinctive role for TAp73β isoform in the control of cell migration and invasion. In fact, TAp73β- dependent induction of p57(Kip2) expression accounted for inhibitory effects on the actin cytoskeleton dynamics and thereby cancer cell motility. In contrast, TAp73α is not able to induce p57(Kip2) expression, and exhibits a positive effect on actin cytoskeleton dynamics as well as cell migration and invasion. In conclusion, the inhibitory effect on cell migration and invasion of TAp73β would qualify this distinct p73 isoform as tumor suppressor gene. In contrast, the promoting effect of TAp73α on cell motility and invasion strengthens the potential oncogenic activities of this p73 isoform.

Inactivation of the tumour suppressor p53 is the most common defect in cancer cells. p53 is a sequence specific transcription factor that is activated in response to various forms of genotoxic stress to induce cell cycle arrest and apoptosis. Induction of p53 is subjected to complex and strict control through several pathways, as it will often determine cellular fate. The p73 protein shares strong structural and functional similarities with p53 such as the potential to activate p53 responsive genes and the ability to induce apoptosis. In addition to alternative splicing at the carboxyl terminus which yields several p73 isoforms, a p73 variant lacking the N-terminal transactivation domain (Delta Np73) was described in mice. In this study, we report the cloning and characterisation of the human Delta Np73 isoforms, their regulation by p53 and their possible role in carcinogenesis. As in mice, human Delta Np73 lacks the transactivation domain and starts with an alternative exon (exon 3'). Its expression is driven by a second promoter located in a genomic region upstream of this exon, supporting the idea of two independently regulated proteins, derived from the same gene. As anticipated, Delta Np73 is capable of regulating TAp73 and p53 function since it is able to block their transactivation activity and their ability to induce apoptosis. Interestingly, expression of the Delta Np73 is strongly up-regulated by the TA isoforms and by p53, thus creating a feedback loop that tightly regulates the function of TAp73 and more importantly of p53. The regulation of Delta Np73 is exerted through a p53 responsive element located on the Delta N promoter. Expression of Delta Np73 not only regulates the function of p53 and TAp73 but also shuts off its own expression, once again finely regulating the whole system. Our data also suggest that increased expression of Delta Np73, functionally inactivating p53, could be involved in tumorogenesis. An extensive analysis of the expression pattern of Delta Np73 in primary tumours would clarify this issue.

Tazarotene, a member of the new class of acetylenic retinoids, has been shown to be effective in the treatment of several hyperproliferative skin diseases, including non-melanoma skin cancer. Its effectiveness is thought to rely on the ability to activate retinoic acid receptors beta and gamma and to induce a number of downstream anti-proliferative genes. Here, we show that the p53-related gene p73 is a target of tazarotene. Indeed, tazarotene modulates the expression of the p73 gene in immortalized keratinocyte cell lines by inducing the pro-apoptotic and anti-proliferative TAp73 isoforms and by repressing the anti-apoptotic and pro-proliferative DeltaNp73 isoforms. This occurs at the transcriptional level through a coordinated action on P1p73 and P2p73 promoters that control the expression of TA and DeltaN isoforms, respectively. The selective downregulation of DeltaNp73 expression by small interfering RNA led to an enhancement of tazarotene-induced bax activation and apoptosis, whereas the downregulation of both TA and DeltaN isoforms impairs tazarotene-mediated apoptosis. These results indicate the relevance of p73 gene products in tazarotene-induced growth inhibition and effectiveness in the treatment of skin tumors.

p73, an important developmental gene, shares a high sequence homology with p53 and induces both G(1) cell cycle arrest and apoptosis. However, the molecular mechanisms through which p73 induces apoptosis are unclear. We found that p73-induced apoptosis is mediated by PUMA (p53 up-regulated modulator of apoptosis) induction, which, in turn, causes Bax mitochondrial translocation and cytochrome c release. Overexpression of p73 isoforms promotes cell death and bax promoter transactivation in a time-dependent manner. However, the kinetics of apoptosis do not correlate with the increase of Bax protein levels. Instead, p73-induced mitochondrial translocation of Bax is kinetically compatible with the induction of cell death. p73 is localized in the nucleus and remains nuclear during the induction of cell death, indicating that the effect of p73 on Bax translocation is indirect. The ability of p73 to directly transactivate PUMA and the direct effect of PUMA on Bax conformation and mitochondrial relocalization suggest a molecular link between p73 and the mitochondrial apoptotic pathway. Our data therefore indicate that PUMA-mediated Bax mitochondrial translocation, rather than its direct transactivation, correlates with cell death. Finally, human DeltaNp73, an isoform lacking the amino-terminal transactivation domain, inhibits TAp73-induced as well as p53-induced apoptosis. The DeltaNp73 isoforms seem therefore to act as dominant negatives, repressing the PUMA/Bax system and, thus, finely tuning p73-induced apoptosis. Our findings demonstrate that p73 elicits apoptosis via the mitochondrial pathway using PUMA and Bax as mediators.

The p53 tumor suppressor is part of a small family of related proteins that includes two other members, p73 and p63. Interest in the p53 family members, their functions and their complex interactions and regulation, has steadily grown over recent years and does not show signs of waning. p73 is a major determinant of chemosensitivity in humans, and mutant p53 proteins carrying specific polymorphisms can induce drug resistance by inhibiting TAp73. Cooperation between TA (transactivating, proapoptotic, antiproliferative) and Delta N (truncated, antiapoptotic, pro-proliferative) p73 isoforms and among the three family members guarantees equilibrium between proliferation, differentiation, and cell death, thus creating a harmony that is lost in several human cancers. In this article, we review our current knowledge of the role of p73 in cancer chemosensitivity and the real prospect of therapy targeting this molecule. We also draw attention to the crucial role of specific phosphorylation and acetylation events for p73-induced apoptosis and drug chemosensitivity.

TP73, despite significant homology to TP53, is not a classic tumor suppressor gene, since it exhibits upregulation of nonmutated products in human tumors and lacks a tumor phenotype in p73-deficient mice. We recently reported that an N-terminally truncated isoform, DeltaNp73, is upregulated in breast and gynecological cancers. We further showed that DeltaNp73 is a potent transdominant inhibitor of wild-type p53 and TAp73 in cultured human tumor cells by efficiently counteracting their target gene transactivations, apoptosis, and growth suppression functions (A. I. Zaika et al., J. Exp. Med. 6:765-780, 2002). Although these data strongly suggest oncogenic properties of DeltaNp73, this can only be directly shown in primary cells. We report here that DeltaNp73 confers resistance to spontaneous replicative senescence of primary mouse embryo fibroblasts (MEFs) and immortalizes MEFs at a 1,000-fold-higher frequency than occurs spontaneously. DeltaNp73 cooperates with cMyc and E1A in promoting primary cell proliferation and colony formation and compromises p53-dependent MEF apoptosis. Importantly, DeltaNp73 rescues Ras-induced senescence. Moreover, DeltaNp73 cooperates with oncogenic Ras in transforming primary fibroblasts in vitro and in inducing MEF-derived fibrosarcomas in vivo in nude mice. Wild-type p53 is likely a major target of DeltaNp73 inhibition in primary fibroblasts since deletion of p53 or its requisite upstream activator ARF abrogates the growth-promoting effect of DeltaNp73. Taken together, DeltaNp73 behaves as an oncogene that targets p53 that might explain why DeltaNp73 upregulation may be selected for during tumorigenesis of human cancers.

The function of p73, a transcription factor belonging to the p53 family, is finely regulated by its steady-state protein stability. p73 protein degradation/stabilization can be regulated by mechanisms in part dependent on the ubiquitin proteasome system (UPS): (i) Itch/NEDD4-like UPS degradation, (ii) NEDD8 UPS degradation, and (iii) NQO1 20S proteasome-dependent (but ubiquitin-independent) breakdown. Here, we show that, in vitro, Calpain I can cleave p73 at two distinct sites: the first proline-rich region and within the oligomerization domain. Consequently, different p73 isoforms can be degraded by calpains, i.e., both N-terminal isoforms (TAp73 and DeltaNp73) as well as the C-terminal isoforms (alpha, beta, gamma, delta). Moreover, overexpression of the specific endogenous calpain inhibitor, calpastatin, in cultured cells increased the steady-state p73 level. This suggests that calpains may play a physiological role in the regulation of p73 protein stability.

p73 is a p53 paralog that encodes proapoptotic (transactivation-competent (TA)) and antiapoptotic (dominant negative) isoforms. TAp73 transcription factors mediate cell cycle arrest and/or apoptosis in response to DNA damage and are involved in developmental processes in the central nervous system and the immune system. p73 proteins may also play a role in the regulation of cell growth. Indeed, p73 expression is itself modulated during the cell cycle and TAp73 proteins accumulate in S phase cells. In addition, the function of p73 proteins is also regulated by post-translational modifications and protein-protein interactions in different cellular and pathophysiological contexts. Here we show that p73 is a physiological target of the p34cdc2-cyclin B mitotic kinase complex in vivo. Both p73beta and p73alpha isoforms are hyperphosphorylated in normal mitotic cells and during mitotic arrest induced by microtubule-targeting drugs. p34cdc2-cyclin B phosphorylates and associates with p73 in vivo, which results in a decreased ability of p73 to both bind DNA and activate transcription in mitotic cells. Indeed, p73 is excluded from condensed chromosomes in meta- and anaphase, redistributes throughout the mitotic cytoplasm, and unlike p53, shows no association with centrosomes. Together these results indicate that M phase-specific phosphorylation of p73 by p34cdc2-cyclin B is associated with negative regulation of its transcriptional activating function.

p73, the first p53 gene homologue, encodes an array of p73 proteins including p73 alpha full-length (TAp73 alpha) and amino-truncated isoforms (Delta Np73 alpha), two proteins with opposite biological functions. TAp73 alpha can induce tumor suppressive properties, while Delta Np73 alpha antagonizes p53 as well as TAp73 in a dominant-negative manner. In human malignant neuroblasts, p53 protein is wild-type but known to be excluded from the nucleus, therefore disabling its function as a tumor suppressor. The present study investigates whether there is a functional link between p73 isoforms and p53 in neuroblastoma. Experiments were performed on two neuroblastoma cell lines differing in their p53 status, e.g. wild-type p53 SH-5Y5Y cells and mutated p53 IGR-N-91 cells. Data indicate that (i) both TA- and Delta N-p73 alpha enhance p53 protein level in SH-SY5Y cells, whereas level remains unchanged in IGR-N-91 cells; (ii) only in SH-SY5Y cells does forced TAp73 alpha overexpression markedly induce nuclear accumulation of p53 protein; (iii) p21 protein expression is increased in both cell lines infected with TAp73, suggesting that, in IGR-N-91 cells, p21 is induced by p73 through a p53-independent pathway; (iv) in the SHSY5Y cell line, Btg2 expression is strongly enhanced in cells overexpressing TA, and to a lesser extent in cells overexpressing Delta N. Taken together our results suggest that TAp73 may restore p53 function in NB with wild-type nonfunctional p53, but not in NB with mutated p53.

p73, unlike p53, is expressed as a number of isomeric forms. Alternative splicing at the 3' end of p73 transcript, together with the usage of a second promoter downstream of exon 3, can generate up to 24 p73 isoforms. Variants lacking the TA domain (DeltaN isoforms) are induced by TAp73 and by p53, and inhibit their transcriptional activity. However, understanding the complex biology of p73 has been handicapped by the lack of high affinity specific antibodies for the different isoforms. Here, we report the characterization, by Western blotting and immunoprecipitation, of three new polyclonal antisera recognizing all p73 isoforms, only DeltaN isoforms or only p73alpha, and which have advantages of affinity and specificity over previously available antibodies.

The p73 gene, a homologue of the p53 tumor suppressor, is expressed as TA and ΔN isoforms. TAp73 has similar activity as p53 and functions as a tumor suppressor whereas ΔNp73 has both pro- and anti-survival functions. While p73 is rarely mutated in spontaneous tumors, the expression status of p73 is linked to the sensitivity of tumor cells to chemotherapy and prognosis for many types of human cancer. Thus, uncovering its regulators in tumors is of great interest. Here, we found that Pirh2, a RING finger E3 ubiquitin ligase, promotes the proteasome-dependent degradation of p73. Specifically, we showed that knockdown of Pirh2 up-regulates, whereas ectopic expression of Pirh2 down-regulates, expression of endogenous and exogenous p73. In addition, Pirh2 physically associates with and promotes TAp73 polyubiquitination both in vivo and in vitro. Moreover, we found that p73 can be degraded by both 20 S and 26 S proteasomes. Finally, we showed that Pirh2 knockdown leads to growth suppression in a TAp73-dependent manner. Taken together, our findings indicate that Pirh2 promotes the proteasomal turnover of TAp73, and thus targeting Pirh2 to restore TAp73-mediated growth suppression in p53-deficient tumors may be developed as a novel anti-cancer strategy.

We found that MEK1 inhibitor PD184352 strikingly increased apoptosis induced by arsenic trioxide (ATO) in 21 of 25 patients with primary acute myelogenous leukemia (AML). Isobologram analysis confirmed the synergistic (13 of 25 patients) or additive (8 of 25 patients) nature of this interaction. Moreover, we demonstrated that the p53-related gene p73 is a molecular target of the combined treatment in AML blasts. Indeed, ATO modulates the expression of the p73 gene by inducing the proapoptotic and antiproliferative TAp73 and the antiapoptotic and proproliferative DeltaNp73 isoforms, thereby failing to elevate the TA/DeltaNp73 ratio. Conversely, treatment with PD184352 reduces the level of DeltaNp73 and blunts the arsenic-mediated up-regulation of DeltaNp73, thus causing an increase in the TA/DeltaNp73 ratio of dual-treated cells. High doses of ATO induced p53 accumulation in 11 of 21 patients. Combined treatment resulted in the induction of the proapoptotic p53/p73 target gene p53AIP1 (p53-regulated apoptosis-inducing protein 1) and greatly enhanced the apoptosis of treated cells.

We aimed to determine the clinical role of the p53 family members p53 and p73 in the responsiveness to platinum-based chemotherapy and survival in ovarian cancer, considering their cross-talk and the p53 polymorphism at codon 72. A detailed analysis of p53 and p73 in a series of 122 ovarian cancers was done. We used a functional yeast-based assay to determine the p53 mutational status. Red yeast colonies, indicating mutant p53, were subsequently sequenced to determine the specific p53 alteration. p53 mutations were divided into two groups according to their previous characterization in the literature: those that efficiently inhibit transcriptionally active TAp73 function and those that do not. A p53 polymorphism at codon 72 was determined in corresponding normal tissue or blood of ovarian cancer patients. Isoform-specific p73 expression analysis using real-time reverse transcription-PCR has previously been done in the majority of ovarian cancers included in this study. In a retrospective chart review, responsiveness to chemotherapy was assessed, and survival data with long follow-up times were collected. Eighty of 122 (65.6%) of ovarian cancers harbored p53 mutations. p53 mutational status was an important determinant of responsiveness to platinum-based chemotherapy in all patients with a residual tumor of <2 cm in diameter after initial surgery (wild-type versus mutant, P = 0.029). In addition, p53 mutational status was a strong prognosticator for recurrence-free and overall survival (P < 0.0001 and P = 0.003, respectively) in univariate analyses. High expression levels of dominant-negative p73 isoforms (DeltaNp73 and DeltaN'p73) significantly correlated with chemotherapeutic failure (P = 0.048) and with worse recurrence-free and overall survival in patients with p53 mutant cancers (P = 0.048 and P = 0.005, respectively). Eight p53 mutations, present in 19 cases, were found that efficiently inhibit TAp73 (i.e., 175H, 220C, 245S, 245D, 248W, 248Q, 266E, and 273H). Patients with p53 mutations that efficiently inhibit TAp73 function had a significantly shorter overall survival than patients with p53 mutations of unknown effect on TAp73 (P = 0.044). The p53 polymorphism at codon 72 had no influence on responsiveness to chemotherapy or survival. We provide the first clinical evidence that dominant-negative p73 isoforms contribute to drug resistance in vivo, underscoring the importance of a p53-p73 cross-talk. NH2-terminally truncated p73 isoforms were of significant clinical effect by providing an additional unfavorable factor for response to platinum-based chemotherapy and survival in p53 mutant ovarian cancers.

The small heat shock protein alphaB-crystallin is a molecular chaperone that is induced by stress and protects cells by inhibiting protein aggregation and apoptosis. To identify novel transcriptional regulators of the alphaB-crystallin gene, we examined the alphaB-crystallin promoter for conserved transcription factor DNA-binding elements and identified a putative response element for the p53 tumor suppressor protein. Ectopic expression of wild-type p53 induced alphaB-crystallin mRNA and protein with delayed kinetics compared to p21. Additionally, the induction of alphaB-crystallin by genotoxic stress was inhibited by siRNAs targeting p53. Although the p53-dependent transactivation of an alphaB-crystallin promoter luciferase reporter required the putative p53RE, chromatin immunoprecipitation failed to detect p53 binding to the alphaB-crystallin promoter. These results suggested an indirect mechanism of transactivation involving p53 family members p63 or p73. DeltaNp73 was dramatically induced by p53 in a TAp73-dependent manner, and silencing p73 suppressed the transcriptional activation of alphaB-crystallin by p53. Moreover, ectopic expression of DeltaNp73alpha (but not other p73 isoforms) increased alphaB-crystallin mRNA levels in the absence of p53. Collectively, our results link the molecular chaperone alphaB-crystallin to the cellular genotoxic stress response via a novel mechanism of transcriptional regulation by p53 and p73.

The secreted mitogen vascular endothelial growth factor, VEGF, plays a pivotal role in angiogenesis. Hypoxia, inactivation of p53 and oncogenic K-Ras induce VEGF expression. Other factors such as p73 may also affect VEGF levels. Curiously, p73 may also regulate angiogenesis by affecting the expression of the pigment epithelium-derived factor, PEDF. Additionally, VEGF might harbor additional functions through the activation of E2F transcription factors. Recently, a new VEGF variant formed by alternative splicing, VEGF(165)b, has been described as exerting anti-angiogenic activity. We study here whether p73 isoforms levels -TAp73 and DeltaTAp73- and p53 and K-Ras status affect the expression of the above-mentioned angiogenesis-related genes (through the correlation between their expressions), the prognostic value of VEGF(165)b and PEDF and the correlation between VEGF and E2F-1 levels. Tumor and normal tissue of 112 colorectal cancer patients was analyzed to evaluate: (i) levels of TAp73, DeltaTAp73, VEGF, VEGF(165)b, PEDF and E2F-1 by quantitative real-time RT-PCR, (ii) p53 status by immunohistochemistry and (iii) mutations in the first exon of K-Ras by PCR-SSCP. Tumor characteristics were examined in each patient. Associations were observed between: (i) specific p73 isoforms and VEGF and VEGF(165)b expression; (ii) DeltaEx2p73 variant and downregulation of PEDF; (iii) VEGF and PEDF expression; (iv) inactive p53 and VEGF(165)b levels; (v) oncogenic K-Ras and PEDF downregulation; (vi) E2F-1 and VEGF expressions; (vii) VEGF(165)b downregulation and poor prognosis parameters of tumors. We conclude that the levels of p73 isoforms could affect the expression of VEGF, VEGF(165)b and PEDF. This scenario becomes complicated because a feedback between VEGF and PEDF may exist. VEGF may activate the E2F-1 factor. Mutations in K-Ras could negatively regulate PEDF expression. p53 inactivation might result in compensatory mechanisms such as over-expression of VEGF(165)b. Our data support the role of VEGF(165)b as a tumor suppressor factor in colorectal carcinogenesis and its possible prognosis value.

The p73 gene is able to encode transcriptionaly active TAp73, as well as a dominant-negatively acting DeltaNp73 transcript isoforms. We studied differential expression of these forms in normal brain as well as glial tumors, by semiquantitative RT-PCR. The expression of p73 was low or undetectable in normal brain tissues. Most of the tumors and non-tumor brain tissues also lacked significant expression of p73 in patients with low-grade astrocytomas. In contrast, most high-grade glial tumors displayed strong up-regulation of TAp73, whereas only a few displayed DeltaNp73 expression. These aberrations may reflect the inactivation of retinoblastoma pathway in these tumors which result in the activation of E2F transcription factors, since TAp73 is a known target of E2F1 gene. The study of TAp73 expression in brain tumors may serve as a means to evaluate the retinoblastoma pathway-dependent tumor progression.

p73, a recently identified gene highly homologous to p53, can transactivate p53 target genes and induce apoptosis. Here we report the identification of an NH(2)-terminal truncated isoform of human p73, DeltaNp73, which is capable of suppressing p53- and p73-dependent transactivation. We speculate that this suppression is achieved by competing for the DNA binding site in the case of p53 and by direct association in the case of TAp73. Expression of DeltaNp73 in cancer cell lines also inhibited suppressive activity of p53 and TAp73 in colony formation, implying possible involvement of DeltaNp73 in oncogenesis by inhibiting the tumor-suppressive function of p53 and TAp73. Also reported is the identification of TAp73eta, a new member of the COOH-terminal truncated isoform of p73 and tissue-specific expression of these isoforms, along with other previously identified p73 isoforms.

The present study aims to investigate the role of p73 in response to cisplatin treatment in p53 wild-type neuroblastoma SH-SY5Y cells. Results showed that cisplatin induced a dose-dependent up-regulation of p53, p73, and a number of p53-responsive genes. Interestingly, endogenous Deltaexon2p73-expression was down-regulated by cisplatin treatment. Neither p21 nor GADD45 induction was observed in p53-deficient Lan-1 cells, although endogenous TAp73 expression was markedly induced. In the presence of cisplatin, exogenous TAp73 overexpression in SH-SY5Y cells induced p21 up-regulation without altering the apoptotic sub-G1 cell population. Moreover, siRNA-mediated suppression of TAp73 expression did not alter the sub-G1 population. Collectively, our results suggest that wt-p53 SH-SY5Y cells respond to cisplatin by inducing p73 isoform regulation and sustaining p53-dependent apoptosis that is independent of TAp73alpha.

Two homologs of the tumor suppressor p53, named p63 and p73, are each expressed from at least two start sites of mRNA synthesis, yielding full-length, transactivating (TA) isoforms, and also aminoterminally truncated (DeltaN) isoforms that act as antagonists to p53. The expression of TAp73-transcripts is induced by E2F and negatively regulated by transforming growth factor beta (TGFbeta). The DeltaNp73 promoter is induced by p53, resulting in negative feedback to control p53 activity. Here, we have analysed the expression of p63 in comparison with p73. In contrast to the induction of DeltaNp73, the expression of DeltaNp63 was reduced by p53 particularly in human keratinocytes, at the mRNA and protein levels. Accordingly, the 3' promoter of p73, but not that of p63, was activated by p53 in reporter assays. DeltaNp73 mRNA and DeltaNp73 protein, but not the p63 gene products, also accumulated when HaCat cells (lacking functional p53) were grown to high density. TAp73, but not TAp63, expression was suppressed by TGFbeta in these cells, and the TAp73, but not the TAp63, promoter was induced by E2F-1. Thus, in contrast to the functional similarities of their respective products, the expression levels of p63 and p73 are regulated by different mechanisms. This might be responsible for the discordant biological roles of p63 and p73 in development, as well as their deviant expression characteristics in cancer.

p73, a member of the p53 family, exhibits activities similar to those of p53, including the ability to induce growth arrest and apoptosis. p73 influences chemotherapeutic responses in human cancer patients, in association with p53. Alternative splicing of the TP73 gene produces many p73 C- and N-terminal isoforms, which vary in their transcriptional activity towards p53-responsive promoters. In this paper, we show that the C-terminal spliced isoforms of the p73 protein differ in their DNA-binding capacity, but this is not an accurate predictor of transcriptional activity. In different p53-null cell lines, p73beta induces either mitochondrial-associated or death receptor-mediated apoptosis, and these differences are reflected in different gene expression profiles. In addition, p73 induces cell cycle arrest and p21(WAF1) expression in H1299 cells, but not in Saos-2. This data shows that TAp73 isoforms act differently depending on the tumour cell background, and have important implications for p73-mediated therapeutic responses in individual human cancer patients.

The p73 gene codes for various different protein isoforms. They include proteins expressed under the control of the P1 promoter that contain a transactivation domain and are similar in function to p53 (TAp73 isoforms), as well as proteins regulated by the P2 promoter that lack this domain and function as dominant negative inhibitors of TAp73 and p53 (DeltaNp73 isoforms). Whereas TAp73 functions as a tumor suppressor with pro-apoptotic function, DeltaNp73 is likely to prevent the induction of apoptosis in tumor cells and to participate in oncogenesis. Here we used a loss-of-function strategy to assess the role of DeltaNp73 in SH-SY5Y neuroblastoma cells. An antisense oligonucleotide designed to target DeltaNp73 mRNA, but not TAp73, was used to effectively downregulate this transcript. DeltaNp73 downregulation was accompanied by increased levels of the pro-apoptotic BH3 family member PUMA at the mRNA and protein level, and by conformational activation of BAX which translocated to mitochondria. These DeltaNp73 antisense-mediated alterations led to the induction of apoptosis as detected by decreased cell viability, augmented DNA fragmentation and increased caspase-3 activity in cell lysates. Our results demonstrate the cytoprotective role of DeltaNp73 in neuroblastoma and suggest its use as a target for molecular intervention therapy.

Medulloblastoma is the most common malignant brain tumor of childhood. Children who relapse usually die of their disease, which reflects resistance to radiation and/or chemotherapy. Improvements in outcome require a better understanding of the molecular basis of medulloblastoma growth and treatment response. TP73 is a member of the TP53 tumor suppressor gene family that has been found to be overexpressed in a variety of tumors and mediates apoptotic responses to genotoxic stress. In this study, we assessed expression of TP73 RNA species in patient tumor specimens and in medulloblastoma cell lines, and manipulated expression of full-length TAp73 and amino-terminal truncated DeltaNp73 to assess their effects on growth. We analyzed medulloblastoma samples from thirty-four pediatric patients and the established medulloblastoma cell lines, Daoy and D283MED, for expression of TP73 RNA including the full-length transcript and the 5'-terminal variants that encode the DeltaNp73 isoform, as well as TP53 RNA using quantitative real time-RTPCR. Protein expression of TAp73 and DeltaNp73 was quantitated with immunoblotting methods. Clinical outcome was analyzed based on TP73 RNA and p53 protein expression. To determine effects of overexpression or knock-down of TAp73 and DeltaNp73 on cell cycle and apoptosis, we analyzed transiently transfected medulloblastoma cell lines with flow cytometric and TUNEL methods. Patient medulloblastoma samples and cell lines expressed full-length and 5'-terminal variant TP73 RNA species in 100-fold excess compared to non-neoplastic brain controls. Western immunoblot analysis confirmed their elevated levels of TAp73 and amino-terminal truncated DeltaNp73 proteins. Kaplan-Meier analysis revealed trends toward favorable overall and progression-free survival of patients whose tumors display TAp73 RNA overexpression. Overexpression of TAp73 or DeltaNp73 induced apoptosis under basal growth conditions in vitro and sensitized them to cell death in response to chemotherapeutic agents. These results indicate that primary medulloblastomas express significant levels of TP73 isoforms, and suggest that they can modulate the survival and genotoxic responsiveness of medulloblastomas cells.

p63 and p73, two p53 family members, play crucial roles in development and tumor suppression. p63 and p73 have multiple isoforms, which have similar or distinct biological functions. Transactivation (TA) isoforms of p63 and p73 have high similarity with p53 and often have biological functions similar to p53. p53 plays an important role in nucleotide excision repair (NER) through transcriptional regulation of target genes involved in NER, including DDB2, XPC and GADD45. To investigate whether TAp63 and TAp73 play a similar role in NER, Saos2 cells with inducible expression of specific isoforms of TAp63 and TAp73, including TAp63α/β/γ and TAp73α/β/γ isoforms, were employed. Overexpression of TAp63γ significantly enhances NER of ultraviolet (UV)-induced DNA damage, including cyclobutane pyrimidine dimers (CPDs) and 6-4 photoproducts, and enhances cell survival after UV irradiation in Soas2 cells. The enhancement of NER of UV-induced DNA damage by TAp63γ was also confirmed in H1299 cells with overexpression of TAp63γ. Consistently, knockdown of endogenous TAp63 decreases NER of UV-induced DNA damage in H1299 cells. TAp63α/β and TAp73α/β/γ isoforms do not have a clear effect on NER in Saos2 or H1299 cells. TAp63γ overexpression clearly induces the expression of DDB2, XPC and GADD45 at both RNA and protein levels. Furthermore, luciferase reporter assays show that TAp63γ transcriptionally activates DDB2, XPC and GADD45 genes through the regulation of the p53 binding elements in these genes. These results demonstrate that TAp63γ enhances NER to remove UV-induced DNA damage and maintain genomic stability through transcriptional induction of a set of NER proteins, which provides an additional important mechanism that contributes to the function of TAp63 in tumor suppression.

Although there have been many studies on the p73 gene, some of its functions still remain unclear. There is little research on the relationship between p73 gene transcription and its protein expression and the response to certain drugs such as oxaliplatin and cetuximab, which are drugs currently used in colorectal cancer.The purpose of this study was to evaluate the impact of TAp73 expression on oxaliplatin and cetuximab-based chemotherapy in colorectal cancer cell lines with different K-Ras and B-Raf mutational status. TAp73 was analyzed in three colorectal tumor cell lines HT-29, SW-480 and Caco-2. mRNA TAp73 was determined using Real time PCR; TAp73 protein by immunoblotting and cell viability was analyzed by the MTT method. We found that mRNA and TAp73 protein were decreased in cells treated with oxaliplatin (in monotherapy or combined with cetuximab) when B-Raf is mutated. This was statistically significant and was also associated with higher cell viability after the treatment. Here, for the first time we report, that there is a signaling loop between B-Raf activation and p73 function.Low expression of TAp73 in colorectal cancer cell lines with mutated B-Raf may be involved in the lack of response to oxaliplatin in monotherapy or combined with cetuximab.

The p53 homologue p73 is overexpressed in many tumors, including lung cancer. We have evaluated the differential expression and subcellular localization of the functionally distinct apoptotic (TA) and anti-apoptotic (DeltaN) isoforms of p73 in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), their possible association with p53 expression and determined the methylation status of the two p73 gene promoters (P1 and P2) in this tumor type. Immunohistochemical analysis showed that both isoforms are expressed in the majority of cases. However, the oncogenic DeltaN variant, derived from the transcripts DeltaN'p73 (from P1) and/or DeltaNp73 (from P2), is localized mainly in the nucleus, while the anti-oncogenic TAp73 isoform (derived from a P1 transcript) is sequestered in the cytoplasm in almost all cases analyzed. Significant correlation was found between p53 and DeltaNp73 expression (p=0.041). Methylation analysis conducted on 41 tumor samples showed that the P1 promoter is almost invariably unmethylated (39/41 cases) whereas P2 was found completely methylated in 17 cases and partially or totally unmethylated in 24 samples. No correlation was found between the methylation status of P1 and P2 and p73 expression. Our results demonstrate that both isoforms contribute to p73 overexpression in NSCLC and suggest that their different intracellular localization may reflect an alteration of the functional p53-p73 network that might contribute to lung cancer development.

The loss of chromosome 1p and chromosome 3 is associated with metastatic disease and decreased survival of uveal melanoma (UM) patients. The p53 homologues, p73 and p63, are located on chromosomes 1p and 3q, respectively. Both are able to activate p53 target genes, resulting in growth arrest, apoptosis and differentiation. N-terminally truncated isoforms of these genes may act as dominant negative inhibitors of wild-type p53 and transactivating activity. Although, p53 is frequently involved in several malignancies it does not play a major role in UM. Altered expression has been reported for both p63 and p73 in various malignancies. In this study, fluorescent in-situ hybridization was performed to identify gains or losses of p63 and p73 loci in UM. The expression of the different p63 and p73 isoforms was evaluated by reverse transcriptase PCR followed by Southern blot analysis. Furthermore, the expression pattern of the various DeltaTAp73 transcripts was analysed in seven primary UMs and 11 UM-derived cell lines using isoform-specific real-time PCR. Our results indicated that the isoform p73Deltaex2/3 was abundantly expressed and a relative loss of the p73 locus was associated with the upregulation of p73Deltaex2 and TAp73 transcripts. N-terminal transactivation forms of both p73 and p63 were observed in primary and metastasis-derived cell lines, as well as in primary melanomas, but in only one of the cell lines a DeltaNp63 mRNA transcript was observed. Our data suggest a potential function of p73 deletion transcripts in UM progression.

The TP73 gene gives rise to transactivation domain-p73 isoforms (TAp73) as well as DeltaNp73 variants with a truncated N terminus. Although TAp73alpha and -beta proteins are capable of inducing cell cycle arrest, apoptosis, and differentiation, DeltaNp73 acts in many cell types as a dominant-negative repressor of p53 and TAp73. It has been proposed that p73 is involved in myeloid differentiation, and its altered expression is involved in leukemic degeneration. However, there is little evidence as to which p73 variants (TA or DeltaN) are expressed during differentiation and whether specific p73 isoforms have the capacity to induce, or hinder, this differentiation in leukemia cells. In this study we identify GATA1 as a direct transcriptional target of TAp73alpha. Furthermore, TAp73alpha induces GATA1 activity, and it is required for erythroid differentiation. Additionally, we describe a functional cooperation between TAp73 and DeltaNp73 in the context of erythroid differentiation in human myeloid cells, K562 and UT-7. Moreover, the impaired expression of GATA1 and other erythroid genes in the liver of p73KO embryos, together with the moderated anemia observed in p73KO young mice, suggests a physiological role for TP73 in erythropoiesis.

We examined the association of one linked GC/AT polymorphism at p73 with the risk of colorectal cancer. In this study, we investigated whether this polymorphism was related to the risk of colorectal cancer, and whether there were relationships between the polymorphism and loss of heterozygosity, protein expression, or clinicopathologic variables. The p73 genotypes were determined by polymerase chain reaction-restriction fragment length polymorphism in 150 Tunisian patients with colorectal cancer and in 204 healthy control subjects. Immunohistochemistry was performed on normal mucosa, primary tumor, and metastasis. The frequencies of the genotypes were 52% for wild-type (GC/GC), 31% for heterozygotes (GC/AT), and 17% for variants(AT/AT) in patients, and 54%, 35%, and 11% in controls, respectively. There were no significant differences of the frequencies of the 3 genotypes between the patients and controls (P=0.11). We did not find any relationship of the genotypes with clinicopathologic features of patients. We found that patients with the GC/GC genotype had a significantly more favorable clinical outcome than the patients with the AT variants (AT/AT or GC/AT genotype). There were no significant difference between tumoral immunostaining and p73 polymorphism (P=0.16) but we found that the samples carrying the AT allele showed a tendency to be more stained in tumor. No loss of heterozygosity was observed at p73 locus. Our results suggest that the AT/AT genotype is significantly associated with poor prognosis in colorectal cancer. All these findings suggest that p73 polymorphism analysis may provide useful prognostic information for colorectal cancer patients.

The protein homologous to the tumor suppressor p53, p73, has essential roles in development and tumorigenesis. This protein exists in a wide range of isoforms with different, even antagonistic, functions. However, there are virtually no detailed morphological studies analyzing the endogenous expression of p73 isoforms at the cellular level in cancer cells. In this study, we investigated the expression and subcellular distribution of two N-terminal isoforms, TAp73 and ΔNp73, in medulloblastoma cells using immunofluorescence microscopy. Both proteins were observed in all cell lines examined, but differences were noted in their intracellular localization between the reference Daoy cell line and four newly established medulloblastoma cell lines (MBL-03, MBL-06, MBL-07 and MBL-10). In the new cell lines, TAp73 and ΔNp73 were located predominantly in cell nuclei. However, there was heterogeneity in TAp73 distribution in the cells of all MBL cell lines, with the protein located in the nucleus and also in a limited non-random area in the cytoplasm. In a small percentage of cells, we detected cytoplasmic localization of TAp73 only, i.e., nuclear exclusion was observed. Our results provide a basis for future studies on the causes and function of distinct intracellular localization of p73 protein isoforms with respect to different protein-protein interactions in medulloblastoma cells.

The goal of this study was to determine whether patterns of expression profiles of p73 isoforms and of p53 mutational status are useful combinatorial biomarkers for predicting outcome in a gynecological cancer cohort. This is the first such study using matched tumor/normal tissue pairs from each patient. The median follow-up was over two years. The expression of all 5 N-terminal isoforms (TAp73, DeltaNp73, DeltaN'p73, Ex2p73 and Ex2/3p73) was measured by real-time RT-PCR and p53 status was analyzed by immunohistochemistry. TAp73, DeltaNp73 and DeltaN'p73 were significantly upregulated in tumors. Surprisingly, their range of overexpression was age-dependent, with the highest differences delta (tumor-normal) in the youngest age group. Correction of this age effect was important in further survival correlations. We used all 6 variables (five p73 isoform levels plus p53 status) as input into a principal component analysis with Varimax rotation (VrPCA) to filter out noise from non-disease related individual variability of p73 levels. Rationally selected and individually weighted principal components from each patient were then used to train a support vector machine (SVM) algorithm to predict clinical outcome. This SVM algorithm was able to predict correct outcome in 30 of the 35 patients. We use here a mathematical tool for pattern recognition that has been commonly used in e.g. microarray data mining and apply it for the first time in a prognostic model. We find that PCA/SVM is able to test a clinical hypothesis with robust statistics and show that p73 expression profiles and p53 status are useful prognostic biomarkers that differentiate patients with good vs. poor prognosis with gynecological cancers.

We evaluate whether 1,25(OH)(2)D(3) downregulates TP73 variants in colon and breast carcinomas, the role of survivin in this context, and the significance of this network in the clinic. Tumor cells were treated/untreated with 1,25(OH)(2)D(3) and transiently transfected with survivin. Levels of survivin and TP73 variants were evaluated by quantitative RT-PCR and Western blotting. In 75 colon and 60 breast cancer patients, the expressions of survivin and TP73 isoforms were determined. Tumor characteristics were examined in each patient. Survivin protein levels were also evaluated in a subgroup of patients and cell lines. Decrease in survivin and TAp73 transcripts and protein and ΔNp73 mRNA was detected after 1,25(OH)(2)D(3) treatment. Ectopic survivin expression led to an increase in the TAp73, ΔNp73, ΔEx2p73, and ΔEx2-3p73 transcripts. In cancer patients, direct correlations were observed between TP73 variants and survivin levels. 1,25(OH)(2)D(3) negatively regulate survivin and TP73 variants in colon and breast cancer cells. Positive regulation of TP73 isoforms by survivin may exist, which reinforces the possibility that the downregulation of TP73 forms by 1,25(OH)(2)D(3) is survivin-dependent.

p73 belongs to the p53 family of transcription factors known to regulate cell cycle and apoptosis. The Trp73 gene has two promoters that drive the expression of two major p73 isoform subfamilies: TA and ΔN. In general, TAp73 isoforms show proapoptotic activities, whereas members of the N-terminally truncated (ΔN) p73 subfamily that lack the transactivation domain show antiapoptotic functions. We found that upregulation of ΔNp73 in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) correlated with reduced survival. Here, we investigated the molecular mechanisms accounting for the oncogenic role of ΔNp73 in HCC. ΔNp73β can directly interfere with the transcriptional activation function of the TA (containing the transactivation domain) isoforms of the p53 family and consequently inhibit transactivation of proapoptotic target genes. Interference of ΔNp73β with apoptosis-/chemosensitivity takes place at several levels of apoptosis signaling. ΔNp73β negatively regulates the genes encoding for the death receptors CD95, TNF-R1, TRAIL-R2 and TNFRSF18. Furthermore, ΔNp73β represses the genes encoding caspase-2, -3, -6, -8 and -9. Concomitantly, ΔNp73β inhibits apoptosis emanating from mitochondria. Thus, ΔNp73 expression in HCC selects against both the death receptor and the mitochondrial apoptosis activity of the TA isoforms. Our data suggest that ΔNp73 isoforms repress apoptosis-related genes of the extrinsic and intrinsic apoptosis signaling pathways thereby contributing to chemoresistance. The clinical importance of these data is evidenced by our finding that the ΔNp73ß target gene signature can predict the prognosis of patients suffering from HCC.

p63 and p73 express two main classes of isoforms: isoforms which contain the transactivation domain (TAp73 and TAp63) executing transcriptional activity and dominant-negative isoforms which are truncated at the NH2-terminus acting as operant inhibitors of TAp73, TAp63 and wild-type p53, and thus possessing oncogenic potential. Like wt p53, TAp63 and TAp73 isoforms transactivate target genes that activate apoptosis signaling pathways. In an attempt to understand how the CD95 gene is regulated by the p53 family, we investigated the contributions of a p53-responsive element (RE) within the first intron of the CD95 gene as well as three elements within the promoter. The intronic element conferred transcriptional activation by p53, TAp63 and TAp73 and cooperated with the p53-REs in the promoter of the CD95 gene. Cooperation between the p53-REs in the promoter and the intronic p53-binding site resulted in maximal transcriptional activation of the CD95 gene by the p53 family.

The ΔNp63 protein, a product of the TP63 gene that lacks the N-terminal domain, has a critical role in the maintenance of self renewal and progenitor capacity in several types of epithelial tissues. ΔNp63 is frequently overexpressed in squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) and in some other epithelial tumours. This overexpression may contribute to tumour progression through dominant-negative effects on the transcriptionally active (TA) isoforms of the p53 family (TAp63, TAp73 and p53), as well as through independent mechanisms. However, the molecular basis of ΔNp63 overexpression is not fully understood. Here, we show that the expression of ΔNp63 is regulated by the Wnt/β-catenin pathway in human hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) and SCC cell lines. This regulation operates in particular through TCF/LEF sites present in the P2 promoter of TP63. In addition, we show that ΔNp63 and β-catenin are frequently coexpressed and accumulated in oesophageal SCC, but not in HCC. These results suggest that activation of the β-catenin pathway may contribute to overexpression of ΔNp63 during tumour progression, in a cell type-specific manner.

p73 shares structural and functional homology to p53. p73 generates different proteins using alternative promoters and splicing which have different biological characteristics. We investigated the pattern (monoallelic or biallelic) of expression of TAp73 and DeltaNp73 in normal lymphocytes and lymphomas using two p73 polymorphisms. We found monoallelic expression of TAp73 in normal lymphocytes and tumors, and a selective expression of AT allele in all cases. Moreover, the quantitative expression analysis revealed DeltaNp73 over-expression in both B- and T-cell lymphomas comparing with normal lymphoid cells, suggesting a role in tumorigenesis. Finally, we have confirmed that although DeltaNp73 over-expression could be an alternative mechanism of p53 inactivation, both alterations may appear together.

p73, like Notch, has been implicated in neurodevelopment and in the maintenance of the mature central nervous system. In this study, by the use of reporter-gene assays, we demonstrate that C-promoter binding factor-1 (CBF-1)-dependent gene transcription driven by the Notch-1 intracellular domain (N1(ICD)) is potently antagonized by exogenously expressed transactivating (TA) p73 splice variants in SH-SY5Y neuroblastomas and in primary neurones. Time course analysis indicated that the inhibitory effects of TAp73 are direct and are not mediated via the product of a downstream target gene. We found that endogenous TAp73 stabilized by either c-Abl or cisplatin treatment also potently antagonized N1(ICD)/CBF-1-dependent gene transcription. Furthermore, western blotting revealed that exogenous TAp73 suppressed endogenous hairy and enhancer of split-1 (HES-1) protein levels and antagonized the increase in HES-1 protein induced by exogenous N1(ICD) expression. Evidence of a direct physical interaction between N1(ICD) and TAp73alpha was demonstrated by co-immunoprecipitation. Using Notch deletion constructs, we demonstrate that TAp73alpha binds the N1(ICD) in a region C-terminal of aa 2094. Interestingly, DeltaNp73alpha and TAp73alpha(R292H) also co-purified with N1(ICD), but neither inhibited N1(ICD)/CBF-1-dependent transcription. This suggests that an intact transactivation (TA) domain and the ability to bind DNA are necessary for TAp73 to antagonize Notch signalling. Finally we found that TAp73alpha reversed the N1(ICD)-mediated repression of retinoic acid-induced differentiation of SH-SY5Y neuroblastomas, providing functional evidence for an inhibitory effect of TAp73alpha on notch signalling. Collectively, these findings may have ramifications for neurodevelopment, neurodegeneration and oncogenesis.

Differential mRNA splicing and alternative promoter usage of the TP73 gene results in the expression of multiple NH2-truncated isoforms that act as oncogenes. Abundant levels of these p73 variants in a variety of human cancers correlated with adverse clinical prognosis and response failure to conventional therapies, underscoring their relevance as marker for disease severity and target for cancer intervention. With respect to an equally important role for amino-truncated p73 splice forms (DeltaTAp73) and DeltaNp73 (summarized as DNp73) in the tumorigenic process, we designed locked nucleic acid (LNA) antisense oligonucleotide (ASO) gapmers against individual species that were complementary to DeltaEx2 and DeltaEx2/3 splice junctions and a region in exon 3B unique for DeltaN' and DeltaN. Treatment of cancer cells with these ASOs resulted in a strong and specific reduction of tumorigenic p73 transcripts and proteins, importantly, without abolishing the wild-type p73 tumor suppressor form as observed with p73-shRNA. The specific antisense oligonucleotides rescued cells from apoptosis inhibition due to overexpression of their corresponding amino-truncated p73 isoform and decreased tumor cell proliferation. Furthermore, ASO-116 against DeltaEx2/3 coupled to magnetic nanobead polyethyleneimine (MNB/PEI) carriers significantly inhibited malignant melanoma growth, which correlated with a shift in the balance between endogenous TAp73 and DeltaEx2/3 towards apoptotic full-length p73. Our study demonstrates the successful development of LNA-ASOs that selectively differentiate between the closely related p73 oncoproteins, and provide new tools to further delineate their biological properties in different human malignancies and for therapeutic cancer targeting.

The p53 gene has been investigated for its role in epithelial ovarian cancer but data collected until now are contradictory. The evidence that p53 belongs with p63 and p73 to a family of transcription factors re-opened interest in this gene family. Here, we used quantitative real time RT-PCR to determine expression levels of TAp53, TAp73 and their N-terminal splice variants in a cohort of 169 ovarian cancer patients with stage I and stage III disease. The TAp73 levels in stage III biopsies differed by 100-fold depending on the p53 status and overall survival appears to be significantly related to DeltaNp73 expression. Kaplan-Meyer analyses did not suggest a correlation between overall survival and levels of TAp73, DeltaNp73 or the DeltaNp73/TAp73 ratio. In conclusion, these data suggest that at least in our patient cohort p53 and p73 expression levels are not correlated to malignant progression of ovarian cancer. They might, however, play a role in tumour initiation.

p73, the p53 homologue, exists as a transactivation-domain-proficient TAp73 or deficient deltaN(DN)p73 form. Expectedly, the oncogenic DNp73 that is capable of inactivating both TAp73 and p53 function, is over-expressed in cancers. However, the role of TAp73, which exhibits tumour-suppressive properties in gain or loss of function models, in human cancers where it is hyper-expressed is unclear. We demonstrate here that both TAp73 and DNp73 are able to specifically transactivate the expression of the anti-apoptotic member of the caspase family, caspase-2(S). Neither p53 nor TAp63 has this property, and only the p73beta form, but not the p73alpha form, has this competency. Caspase-2 promoter analysis revealed that a non-canonical, 18 bp GC-rich Sp-1-binding site-containing region is essential for p73beta-mediated activation. However, mutating the Sp-1-binding site or silencing Sp-1 expression did not affect p73beta's transactivation ability. In vitro DNA binding and in vivo chromatin immunoprecipitation assays indicated that p73beta is capable of directly binding to this region, and consistently, DNA binding p73 mutant was unable to transactivate caspase-2(S). Finally, DNp73beta over-expression in neuroblastoma cells led to resistance to cell death, and concomitantly to elevated levels of caspase-2(S.) Silencing p73 expression in these cells led to reduction of caspase-2(S) expression and increased cell death. Together, the data identifies caspase-2(S) as a novel transcriptional target common to both TAp73 and DNp73, and raises the possibility that TAp73 may be over-expressed in cancers to promote survival.

p73, a p53-related gene, encodes two classes of isoforms with opposing functions: (1) a full-length transactivation-competent p73 protein (TAp73) with tumour suppressor activity; and (2) a group of NH2-terminally truncated, transactivation-deficient p73 proteins, deltaEx2p73, deltaEx2-3p73, deltaNp73 and deltaN'p73 (collectively named deltaTAp73) with oncogenic activity. In this study, for the first time, we analyse the deregulations of TAp73 and deltaTAp73 in head and neck squamous cell cancer (HNSCC) and compare them to p53 status. We found that all the p73 isoforms in HNSCC tissue were upregulated with respect to those in normal adjacent tissue. Concomitant upregulations of p73 transcripts were often found in cancer tissue but not in normal tissue. p53 mutations and p73 transcript alterations are not mutually exclusive. All the HNSCC specimens studied had at least one p53 mutation and/or one deltaTAp73 transcript alteration. Although both the deltaNp73 and the TAp73 transcripts were found to be upregulated in head and neck cancers, the predominant protein in the cancers analysed was deltaNp73. TAp73, in contrast, was only weakly expressed. This finding is highly relevant and sheds light on the puzzling question of the biological significance of TAp73 upregulation in cancers. deltaNp73 protein levels were significantly overexpressed in HNSCC tissue compared to matched normal tissue (p = 0.003). Furthermore, a trend was found for better overall survival in patients with a low expression of deltaNp73. Our results show that the deregulation of both the p53 and the p73 pathways plays an important role in inducing head and neck cancers.

Although full-length TAp73 variants largely mimic p53 suppressor activities, the transactivation-deficient transcripts DeltaTAp73 exert an oncogenic effect by inactivating p53 and TAp73 suppressor properties. Additionally, DeltaTAp73 may cooperate with oncogenic RAS to induce cell transformation, confer drug resistance, and induce the phosphorylation of phosphorylated Rb. Here, we study the expression of TAp73 and DeltaTAp73 variants and assess possible associations with E2F-1, p53 and K-ras status. We address the possible clinical relevance of alterations in these genes. We determine in 113 colon and 60 breast cancer patients (a) the expression levels of TAp73, DeltaTAp73 (DeltaEx2p73, DeltaEx2/3p73, and DeltaNp73), and E2F-1 transcripts by quantitative real-time reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (PCR); (b) mutations in the first exon of K-ras by PCR-single-stranded confirmational polymorphism; and (c) p53 status by immunohistochemistry. Tumor characteristics were examined in each patient. Both suppressor and oncogenic isoforms of TP73 were significantly coupregulated in tumor tissues. Associations were observed between (a) p53 wild type status and upregulation of some TP73 variants; (b) overexpression of E2F-1 and some TP73 forms; and (c) upregulation of DeltaTAp73 variants and advanced pathologic stage, lymph node metastasis, vascular invasion, presence of polyps, and tumor localization. Overexpression of TP73 variants in tumor tissues indicates that they may be involved in colon and breast carcinogenesis. The association between upregulation of DeltaTAp73 isoforms and poor prognosis features, specifically advanced tumor stage, suggests that they may be of practical clinical prognostic value. Interestingly, the in vivo associations identified here may indicate a functional network involving p73 variants, p53, and E2F-1.

TAp73 variants largely mimic p53 suppressor activities, while DeltaTAp73 forms act as oncogenes through the inactivation of p53 and TAp73. The present study analysed how TAp73 and DeltaTAp73 levels might be affected by the presence of a 73 bp deletion in a regulatory region of p73. The clinical relevance of this deletion was also examined. ZEB1 can bind to the region repressing p73 transcription in vitro. The relationship between ZEB1 and p73 variant expression levels was studied in the context of this deletion and the levels of the ZEB1 cofactors p300 and CtBP. Tumour and normal tissue from 81 colorectal cancer patients was analysed to evaluate firstly the levels of TAp73, DeltaTAp73 (DeltaEx2p73, DeltaEx2/3p73, and DeltaNp73), ZEB1, p300, and CtBP by quantitative real-time RT-PCR, and secondly the presence of the 73 bp deletion. Tumour characteristics were examined in each patient. Suppressor and oncogenic isoforms of p73 were co-up-regulated in tumour tissues. Overexpression of p73 variants was associated with adverse tumour features. The 73 bp deletion was present in 40% of the patients and was associated with adverse pathological parameters of the tumours and also with TAp73 down-regulation. In those cases harbouring the deletion, the levels of ZEB1 and those of DeltaEx2p73, DeltaEx2/3p73, and DeltaNp73 correlated directly. Variations in the concentration of p300 affected the observed correlations between ZEB1 and the different p73 variants. In conclusion, in colorectal cancer, the 73 bp deletion in the first intron of the p73 gene and different expression levels of ZEB1 and p300 may act in concert to affect the ratio of TAp73/DeltaTAp73 forms, favouring p73 oncogenic variants. In addition, up-regulation of p73 oncogenic isoforms predicts a poor prognosis based on its relationship with advanced tumour stage.

Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is a devastating paralytic disorder caused by dysfunction and degeneration of motor neurons starting in adulthood. Most of our knowledge about the pathophysiological mechanisms of ALS comes from transgenic mice models that emulate a subgroup of familial ALS cases (FALS), with mutations in the gene encoding superoxide dismutase (SOD1). In the more than 15 years since these mice were generated, a large number of abnormal cellular mechanisms underlying motor neuron degeneration have been identified, but to date this effort has led to few improvements in therapy, and no cure. Here, we consider that this surfeit of mechanisms is best interpreted by current insights that suggest a very early initiation of pathology in motor neurons, followed by a diversity of secondary cascades and compensatory mechanisms that mask symptoms for decades, until trauma and/or aging overloads their protective function. This view thus posits that adult-onset ALS is the consequence of processes initiated during early development. In fact, motor neurons in neonatal mutant SOD mice display important alterations in their intrinsic electrical properties, synaptic inputs and morphology that are accompanied by subtle behavioral abnormalities. We consider evidence that human mutant SOD1 protein in neonatal hSOD1(G93A) mice instigates motor neuron degeneration by increasing persistent sodium currents and excitability, in turn altering synaptic circuits that control excessive motor neuron firing and leads to excitotoxicity. We also discuss how therapies that are aimed at suppressing abnormal neuronal activity might effectively mitigate or prevent the onset of irreversible neuronal damage in adulthood. J. Cell.

To determine the protein and mRNA expression of p53, p63, and p73 in central and peripheral human corneal endothelial cells. Since these proteins are known to be involved in the regulation of cell division, this study seeks information about their influence in regulating cell proliferation in the human corneal endothelium. Human donor corneas were separated into central and peripheral sections. The endothelial tissue from these samples was dissected and samples were analyzed for mRNA transcription of p53, transactivating p63 (TAp63), delta N p63 (DeltaNp63), transactivating p73 (TAp73), and delta N p73 (DeltaNp73) via the reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). Additional samples were analyzed for p53, p63, and p73 protein expression via SDS-PAGE, western blotting, and immunodetection. Frozen corneal sections were immunostained for p53 and analyzed via fluorescence microscopy. p53 and TAp63 mRNA and protein expression were detected in central and peripheral human corneal endothelium. p53 and TAp63 protein expression were greater in central than in peripheral tissue. DeltaNp63 and all isoforms of p73 were not detected in either central or peripheral corneal endothelium. p53 is expressed in both peripheral and central human corneal endothelium, although it is more highly expressed in the central endothelium. Similarly, TAp63 is more highly expressed in central rather than in peripheral endothelium. This suggests that the peripheral endothelium may have more potential for cell division than the central endothelium. DeltaNp63, a stem cell marker, was not detected in the corneal endothelium. Neither the TAp73 nor the DeltaNp73 isoforms were detected in either central or peripheral human corneal endothelium.

p73, a p53 family tumor suppressor, is expressed as TA and ΔN isoforms. Due to the role of p73 in tumor suppression and neural development, its expression and activity are tightly regulated by multiple mechanisms, including transcription and posttranslational modifications. Here, we found that p73 mRNA stability is regulated by RNPC1, an RNA binding protein and a target of the p53 family. We also showed that a CU-rich element in the 3' untranslated region of p73 is recognized by and responsive to RNPC1. To explore the physiological significance of RNPC1-regulated p73 expression, we showed that the loss of RNPC1 in p53-null mouse embryonic fibroblasts leads to reduced expression of p73, along with decreased expression of p21, p130, and γ-H2A.X, and consequently a decreased number of senescent cells. Furthermore, we observed that knockdown of TAp73 or p21, another target of RNPC1, attenuates the inhibitory effect of RNPC1 on cell proliferation and premature senescence, whereas combined knockdown of TAp73 and p21 completely abolishes it. Due to the fact that RNPC1 is a target of p73, the mutual regulation between p73 and RNPC1 constitutes a novel feed-forward loop, which might be explored as a target for tumors without a functional p53.

Apoptin, a protein derived from the chicken anaemia virus, induces cell death in various cancer cells but shows little or no cytotoxicity in normal cells. The mechanism of apoptin-induced cell death is currently unknown but it appears to induce apoptosis independent of p53 status. Here we show that p73, a p53 family member, is important in apoptin-induced apoptosis. In p53 deficient and/or mutated cells, apoptin induced the expression of TAp73 leading to the induction of apoptosis. Knockdown of p73 using siRNA resulted in a significant reduction in apoptin-induced cytotoxicity. The p53 and p73 pro-apoptotic target PUMA plays an important role in apoptin-induced cell death as knockdown of PUMA significantly reduced cell sensitivity to apoptin. Importantly, apoptin expression resulted in a marked increase in TAp73 protein stability. Investigation into the mechanisms of TAp73 stability showed that apoptin induced the expression of the ring finger domain ubiquitin ligase PIR2 which is involved in the degradation of the anti-apoptotic ∆Np73 isoform. Collectively, our results suggest a novel mechanism of apoptin-induced apoptosis through increased TAp73 stability and induction of PIR2 resulting in the degradation of ∆Np73 and activation of pro-apoptotic targets such as PUMA causing cancer cell death.

The p73 gene possesses an extrinsic P1 promoter and an intrinsic P2 promoter, resulting in TAp73 and DeltaNup73 isoforms, respectively. The ultimate effect of p73 in oncogenesis is thought to depend on the apoptotic TA to antiapoptotic DeltaN isoforms' ratio. This study was aimed at identifying novel transcription factors that affect TA isoform synthesis. With the use of bioinformatics tools, in vitro binding assays, and chromatin immunoprecipitation analysis, a region extending -233 to -204 bp upstream of the transcription start site of the human p73 P1 promoter, containing conserved Sp1-binding sites, was characterized. Treatment of cells with Sp1 RNAi and Sp1 inhibitor functionally suppress TAp73 expression, indicating positive regulation of P1 by the Sp1 protein. Notably Sp1 inhibition or knockdown also reduces DeltaNup73 protein levels. Therefore, Sp1 directly regulates TAp73 transcription and affects DeltaNup73 levels in lung cancer. TAp73gamma was shown to be the only TA isoform overexpressed in several lung cancer cell lines and in 26 non-small cell lung cancers, consistent with Sp1 overexpression, thereby questioning the apoptotic role of this specific p73 isoform in lung cancer.

Mice with a complete deficiency of p73 have severe neurological and immunological defects due to the absence of all TAp73 and DeltaNp73 isoforms. As part of our ongoing program to distinguish the biological functions of these isoforms, we generated mice that are selectively deficient for the DeltaNp73 isoform. Mice lacking DeltaNp73 (DeltaNp73(-/-) mice) are viable and fertile but display signs of neurodegeneration. Cells from DeltaNp73(-/-) mice are sensitized to DNA-damaging agents and show an increase in p53-dependent apoptosis. When analyzing the DNA damage response (DDR) in DeltaNp73(-/-) cells, we discovered a completely new role for DeltaNp73 in inhibiting the molecular signal emanating from a DNA break to the DDR pathway. We found that DeltaNp73 localizes directly to the site of DNA damage, can interact with the DNA damage sensor protein 53BP1, and inhibits ATM activation and subsequent p53 phosphorylation. This novel finding may explain why human tumors with high levels of DeltaNp73 expression show enhanced resistance to chemotherapy.

P73 belongs to the p53 family of cell survival regulators with the corresponding locus Trp73 producing the N-terminally distinct isoforms, TAp73 and DeltaNp73. Recently, two studies have implicated the murine Trp73 in the modulation in phospho-tau accumulation in aged wild type mice and in young mice modeling Alzheimer's disease (AD) suggesting that Trp73, particularly the DeltaNp73 isoform, links the accumulation of amyloid peptides to the creation of neurofibrillary tangles (NFTs). Here, we reevaluated tau pathologies in the same TgCRND8 mouse model as the previous studies. Despite the use of the same animal models, our in vivo studies failed to demonstrate biochemical or histological evidence for misprocessing of tau in young compound Trp73+/- + TgCRND8 mice or in aged Trp73+/- mice analyzed at the ages reported previously, or older. Secondly, we analyzed an additional mouse model where the DeltaNp73 was specifically deleted and confirmed a lack of impact of the DeltaNp73 allele, either in heterozygous or homozygous form, upon tau pathology in aged mice. Lastly, we also examined human TP73 for single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and/or copy number variants in a meta-analysis of 10 AD genome-wide association datasets. No SNPs reached significance after correction for multiple testing and no duplications/deletions in TP73 were found in 549 cases of AD and 544 non-demented controls. Our results fail to support P73 as a contributor to AD pathogenesis.

The majority of tumors arising in BRCA1 mutation carriers exhibit inactivation of p53, a key effector of cell death after DNA damage. Despite the loss of p53, BRCA1-deficient tumor cells exhibit increased sensitivity to cisplatin, and patients with BRCA1-associated ovarian carcinomas experience improved outcomes with platinum-based chemotherapy compared with sporadic cases. Although it is known that chemosensitivity in BRCA1-associated cancers is associated with unrepaired DNA damage, the specific effector pathway mediating the cellular response to platinum-induced damage in these tumors is poorly understood. Here, we show that the p53-related gene p73, encoding a proapoptotic protein that is linked to chemosensitivity in many settings, is upregulated through a novel epigenetic mechanism in both human and murine models of BRCA1-associated ovarian carcinoma. BRCA1-deficient ovarian carcinoma cells exhibit hypermethylation within a p73 regulatory region, which includes the binding site for the p73 transcriptional repressor ZEB1, leading to the abrogation of ZEB1 binding and increased expression of transactivating p73 isoforms (TAp73). Cisplatin chemotherapy induces TAp73 target genes specifically in BRCA1-deficient cells, and knockdown of TAp73 in these cells causes chemoresistance while having little or no effect on BRCA1-expressing tumor cells. In primary ovarian carcinomas, ZEB1 binding site methylation and TAp73 expression correlate with BRCA1 status and with clinical response. Together, these findings uncover a novel regulatory mechanism that supports the contribution of TAp73 as an important mediator of the response to platinum chemotherapy in a subset of ovarian carcinomas. TAp73 might represent a response predictor and potential therapeutic target for enhancing chemosensitivity in this disease.

The p73 gene is a p53 homologue which induces apoptosis and inhibits cell proliferation. Although p73 maps at 1p36.3 and is frequently deleted in neuroblastoma (NB), it does not act as a classic oncosuppressor gene. In developing sympathetic neurons of mice, p73 is predominantly expressed as a truncated anti-apoptotic isoform (DeltaNp73), which antagonizes both p53 and the full-length p73 protein (TAp73). This suggests that p73 may be part of a complex tumor-control mechanism. To determine the role of DeltaNp73 in NB we analyzed the pattern of expression of this gene in vivo and evaluated the prognostic significance of its expression. Our results indicate that DeltaNp73 expression is associated with reduced apoptosis in a NB tumor tissue. Expression of this variant in NB patients significantly correlates with age at diagnosis and VMA urinary excretion. Moreover it is strongly associated with reduced survival (HR=7.93; P<0.001) and progression-free survival (HR=5.3; P<0.001) and its role in predicting a poorer outcome is independent from age, primary tumor site, stage and MYCN amplification (OS: HR=5.24, P=0.012; PFS: HR=4.36, P=0.005). In conclusion our data seem to indicate that DeltaNp73 is a crucial gene in neuroblastoma pathogenesis.

A member of the p53 family, p73, has several isoforms and differentially regulates transcription of genes involved in the control of the cell cycle and apoptosis. We have previously shown efficient and p53-independent, tumor-specific cell death induced by the viral proteins E1A and Apoptin. Here, we demonstrate that the induction of apoptosis by these viral proteins involves activation of TAp73. Both E1A and Apoptin induced expression of endogenous TAp73 and the p53/p73 BH3-only pro-apoptotic target, PUMA, independently of the p53 function. Furthermore, exogenous expression of TAp73 isoforms, particularly TAp73beta, sensitized cells to killing by both E1A and Apoptin, while expression of DeltaNp73alpha blocked this activity. Besides, knockout of the p73 regulator, c-Abl, attenuated E1A-induced apoptosis. In accordance with the role of p73 in apoptosis induced by these viral proteins, overexpression of TAp73beta strongly induced apoptosis in p53-deficient cancer cells in vitro and in HNSCC xenografts. Using a doxycycline-inducible system, we provide evidence for target selectivity and significant differences in protein stability for specific p73 isoforms, suggesting a diverse and pivotal role for p73 in response to various genotoxic agents. Collectively, our data show that in the absence of the p53 function, viral proteins E1A and Apoptin utilize the p73 pathway to induce efficient tumor cell death.

To evaluate the diagnostic and prognostic usefulness of procalcitonin (PCT) in patients admitted to the Emergency Department (ED) with signs of infections and to assess the prognostic value of repeated measurements in predicting hospital mortality. A prospective, observational study was conducted in our 400-bed General Teaching Hospital. 261 patients arriving in ED with signs/symptoms of infection were enrolled. PCT was performed upon arrival in the ED (T0), and 5 days after antibiotic therapy (T5). Blood cultures were performed in all patients upon arrival in the ED. Mean T0 PCT value was 7.1±17.9 ng/ml, and at T5 3±9.1 ng/ml (p < 0.0001). Mean PCT in septic non-survivors was increased at T5 compared to T0 but not significantly. The PCT increase at T5 was an independent factor of mortality (OR = 1.29, p < 0.02) in septic patients. Compared to baseline mean delta % PCT decrease at T5 was 28%. Patients with a decrease delta % PCT > 28% showed a lower number of deaths, with a statistical significant difference if compared to those patients with a < 28% decrease (p < 0.004). ROC curve of delta % PCT for prediction of death has an AUC = 0.82 (p < 0.03). PCT is a useful marker for diagnosis of systemic and local infections, and for prognostic stratification in patients with acute infectious diseases at their arrival in ED. PCT variations after antibiotic therapy are highly predictive for in-hospital mortality. PCT normalization during antibiotic therapy suggests a good response to infection possibly leading to less infection-related deaths.

Histone deacetylases (HDACs) play important roles in fundamental cellular processes, and HDAC inhibitors are emerging as promising cancer therapeutics. p73, a member of the p53 family, plays a critical role in tumor suppression and neural development. Interestingly, p73 produces two classes of proteins with opposing functions: the full-length TAp73 and the N-terminally truncated ΔNp73. In the current study, we sought to characterize the potential regulation of p73 by HDACs and found that histone deacetylase 1 (HDAC1) is a key regulator of TAp73 protein stability. Specifically, we showed that HDAC1 inhibition by HDAC inhibitors or by siRNA shortened the half-life of TAp73 protein and subsequently decreased TAp73 expression under normal and DNA damage-induced conditions. Mechanistically, we found that HDAC1 knockdown resulted in hyperacetylation and inactivation of heat shock protein 90, which disrupted the interaction between heat shock protein 90 and TAp73 and thus promoted the proteasomal degradation of TAp73. Functionally, we found that down-regulation of TAp73 was required for the enhanced cell migration mediated by HDAC1 knockdown. Together, we uncover a novel regulation of TAp73 protein stability by HDAC1-heat shock protein 90 chaperone complex, and our data suggest that TAp73 is a critical downstream mediator of HDAC1-regulated cell migration.

The p53 activities are due, at least in part, to its ability to form oligomers that bind to specific DNA sequences and activate transcription. Since some mutant p53 proteins and ΔNp73 isoforms form heterocomplexes with TAp73, we asked whether p53 isoforms can do the same and potentially act as dominant-negative inhibitors of TAp73. Moreover, it has already been found that some isoforms form complex with wtp53 and some of them inhibit p53 tumor-suppressor functions. Therefore, we studied the complex formation and co-immunoprecipitation assays show that all six p53 isoforms examined can form complexes with TAp73β, whereas only Δ133p53α/β/γ isoforms form complex with TAp73α. All p53 isoforms counteract TAp73β transactivation function but with different efficiency and in a promoter-dependent manner. Furthermore, apoptotic activity of TAp73β was augmented by coexpression of p53β, whereas Δ133p53α and β inhibit its apoptotic activity most efficiently. We have determined the half-life of different p53 isoforms: p53γ isoform has the shortest half-life, whereas Δ133p53γ has the longest half-life. Inhibitory interactions of two proteins in complex often lead to their stabilization. However, only three isoforms (Δ133p53α, Δ133p53β and Δ40p53α) stabilize TAp73β. We are convinced that defining the interactions between p53/p73 would give a new insight into how the p53 isoforms modulate the p73 functions in tumorigenesis.

MYCN activation, mainly by gene amplification, is one of the most frequent molecular events in neuroblastoma (NB) oncogenesis, and is associated with increased malignancy and decreased neuronal differentiation propensity. The frequency of concomitant loss of heterozygosity at the 1p36.3 locus, which harbours the p53 anti-oncogene homologue TP73, indicates that MYCN and p73 alterations may cooperate in the pathogenesis of NB. We have previously shown that p73 isoforms are deregulated in NB tumours and that TAp73 co-operates synergistically with p53 for apoptosis of NB cells, whereas DeltaNp73 activates the expression of neuronal differentiation genes such as BTG2. Herein, using both ectopic expression and RNA interference-mediated silencing of p73 in MYCN amplified NB cells, we show that p73alpha isoforms inhibit MYCN expression at both transcript and protein levels, in spite of transactivator effects on MYCN promoter. To explain this paradox, we found that TAp73alpha exerts negative post-transcriptional effects leading to reduced MYCN mRNA stability. RNA immunoprecipitation experiments suggest that this dominant inhibitory post-transcriptional effect could be due to an interaction between the p73 protein and MYCN mRNA, a hypothesis also raised for the regulation of certain genes by the p53 protein.

The p53-family member p73 plays a role in various cellular signaling pathways during development and growth control and it can have tumor suppressor properties. Several isoforms of p73 exist with considerable differences in their function. Whereas the functions of the N-terminal isoforms (TA and ΔNp73) and their opposing pro- and antiapoptotic roles have become evident, the functional differences of the distinct C-terminal splice forms of TAp73 have remained unclear. Here, we characterized the global genomic binding sites for TAp73α and TAp73β by chromatin immunoprecipitation sequencing as well as the transcriptional responses by performing RNA sequencing. We identified a specific p73 consensus binding motif and found a strong enrichment of AP1 motifs in close proximity to binding sites for TAp73α. These AP1 motif-containing target genes are selectively upregulated by TAp73α, while their mRNA expression is repressed upon TAp73β induction. We show that their expression is dependent on endogenous c-Jun and that recruitment of c-Jun to the respective AP1 sites was impaired upon TAp73β expression, in part due to downregulation of c-Jun. Several of these AP1-site containing TAp73α-induced genes impinge on apoptosis induction, suggesting an underlying molecular mechanism for the observed functional differences between TAp73α and TAp73β.

To clarify the role of p53 homologs in oncogenesis and cytodifferentiation of odontogenic tumors, expression of p63 and p73 was analyzed in ameloblastomas as well as tooth germs. Tissue specimens of nine tooth germs and 48 benign and five malignant ameloblastomas were examined by immunohistochemistry and reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) for the expression of p63 and p73. Immunoreactivity for p63 and p73 was evident in epithelial cells neighboring the basement membrane in developing and neoplastic odontogenic tissues. p63 expression in desmoplastic ameloblastomas was significantly higher than in acanthomatous and granular cell ameloblastomas, and ameloblastic carcinomas showed higher p63 expression than metastasizing ameloblastomas. p73 expression was significantly higher in plexiform ameloblastomas than in follicular ameloblastomas, and basal cell ameloblastomas showed higher p73 expression than granular cell ameloblastomas. mRNA transcripts for Delta Np63 and TAp73 were detected in all developing and neoplastic odontogenic tissues. TAp63 mRNA was expressed in five of eight tooth germs, 16 of 34 ameloblastomas, and one of one malignant ameloblastoma, whereas Delta Np73 mRNA was recognized in one of eight tooth germs, nine of 34 ameloblastomas, and one of one malignant ameloblastoma. The expression of p63 and p73 suggests that these p53 homologs play a role in differentiation and proliferation of odontogenic epithelial cells. Variations of predominantly expressed isoforms suggest that p63 and p73 might differentially function in odontogenic tissues.

p73, a homolog of the p53 tumor suppressor, codes for full-length transactivating (TA) and N-terminally truncated (DeltaN) isoforms, with pro- and anti-apoptotic activities, respectively. We examined the expression of the main p73 isoforms in adult human and mouse telencephalon and choroid plexus by immunohistochemistry on paraffin sections, and immunoblotting (IB) of tissue extracts and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), using antibodies against different protein domains. Cortical neurons expressed TAp73 predominantly in the cytoplasm and DeltaNp73 mainly in the nucleus, with partial overlap in the cytoplasm. Highest expression was found in the hippocampus. IB showed an array of TAp73 variants in adult human cortex and hippocampus. IB of human choroid plexus and CSF using TAp73-specific antibodies revealed the presence of a approximately 90-kDa protein whose molecular weight was reduced after N-deglycosylation, suggesting that glycosylated TAp73 is exported into the CSF. In the mouse, high expression of TAp73 was also detected in the subcommissural organ (SCO), an ependymal gland absent in adult humans. TAp73 colocalized with anti-fibra-Reissner-antibody (AFRU), which is a marker of Reissner's fiber, the secreted SCO product. p73-deficient mice had generalized cortical hypoplasia and hydrocephalus; in addition, we observed a dramatic size reduction of the choroid plexus. However, the SCOs were apparently unaltered and continued to secrete Reissner's fiber. Our findings point to complex and widespread p73 activities in the maintenance of adult cortical neurons and in brain homeostasis. TAp73 in the CSF may play important roles in the maintenance of the adult ventricular wall as well as in the development of the proliferating neuroepithelium.

The p53 gene family consists of the three genes p53, p63 and p73, which have polyhedral non-overlapping functions in pivotal cellular processes such as DNA synthesis and repair, growth arrest, apoptosis, genome stability, angiogenesis, development and differentiation. These genes encode sequence-specific nuclear transcription factors that recognise the same responsive element (RE) in their target genes. Their inactivation or aberrant expression may determine tumour progression or developmental disease. The discovery of several protein isoforms with antagonistic roles, which are produced by the expression of different promoters and alternative splicing, widened the complexity of the scenario of the transcriptional network of the p53 family members. Therefore, the identification of the genes transactivated by p53 family members is crucial to understand the specific role for each gene in cell cycle regulation. We have combined a genome-wide computational search of p53 family REs and microarray analysis to identify new direct target genes. The huge amount of biological data produced has generated a critical need for bioinformatic tools able to manage and integrate such data and facilitate their retrieval and analysis. We have developed the p53FamTaG database (p53 FAMily TArget Genes), a modular relational database, which contains p53 family direct target genes selected in the human genome searching for the presence of the REs and the expression profile of these target genes obtained by microarray experiments. p53FamTaG database also contains annotations of publicly available databases and links to other experimental data. The genome-wide computational search of the REs was performed using PatSearch, a pattern-matching program implemented in the DNAfan tool. These data were integrated with the microarray results we produced from the overexpression of different isoforms of p53, p63 and p73 stably transfected in isogenic cell lines, allowing the comparative study of the transcriptional activity of all the proteins in the same cellular background.p53FamTaG database is available free at http://www2.ba.itb.cnr.it/p53FamTaG/ CONCLUSION: p53FamTaG represents a unique integrated resource of human direct p53 family target genes that is extensively annotated and provides the users with an efficient query/retrieval system which displays the results of our microarray experiments and allows the export of RE sequences. The database was developed for supporting and integrating high-throughput in silico and experimental analyses and represents an important reference source of knowledge for research groups involved in the field of oncogenesis, apoptosis and cell cycle regulation.

The Brn-3a/POU4F1 POU transcription factor is critical for the survival and differentiation of specific sensory neurons during development or upon injury; by regulating expression of target genes, either directly or indirectly upon interaction with other proteins. In this study, we demonstrated the physical interaction of Brn-3a with different p73 isoforms and showed co-localization in sensory neurons arising from the neural crest. The biological effects of p73/ Brn-3a interaction depend on the particular p73 isoform, because co-expression of Brn-3a with TAp73 enhanced cell cycle arrest, whereas Brn-3a and DeltaNp73 cooperated to increase protection from apoptosis. Brn-3a antagonized TAp73 transactivation of pro-apoptotic Bax, but co-operated to increase transcription of the cell cycle regulator p21 CIP1/Waf1. The region 425-494 amino acids within the TAp73 C terminus were critical for Brn-3a to repress Bax transactivation, but not for cooperation on the p21 CIP1/Waf1 promoter. Our results suggest that co-factors binding to the p73 C terminus facilitate maximal activation on the Bax but not p21 CIP1/Waf1 promoter and that Brn-3a modulates this interaction. Thus, the physical interaction of Brn-3a with specific p73 isoforms will be critical for determining cell fate during neuronal development or in injured neurons expressing both factors.

Glial tumours are a devastating, poorly understood condition carrying a gloomy prognosis for which clinicians sorely lack reliable predictive parameters facilitating a sound treatment strategy. Tp73, a p53 family member, expresses two main classes of isoforms--transactivatory activity (TA)p73 and DeltaTAp73--exhibiting tumour suppressor gene and oncogene properties, respectively. The authors examined their expression status in high- and low-grade adult gliomas. Isoform-specific real-time reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction was used for the analysis of Tp73 isoform transcript expression in a series of 51 adult patients harbouring glial tumours, in order to compare tumour grades with each other, and with non-tumoural samples obtained from epileptic patients as well. Our data demonstrate increase of TAp73 and DeltaTAp73 transcript levels at onset and early stage of the disease. We also show that DeltaEx2-3 isoform expression in low-grade tumours anticipates clinical and imaging progression to higher grades, and correlates to the patients' survival. Expression levels of P1 promoter generated Tp73 isoforms--and particularly DeltaEx2-3--indeed allow for prediction of the clinical progression of low-grade gliomas in adults. Our data are the first such molecular biology report regarding low-grade tumours and as such should be of help for sound decision-making.

Breast cancers lacking estrogen and progesterone receptor expression and Her2 amplification exhibit distinct gene expression profiles and clinical features, and they comprise the majority of BRCA1-associated tumors. Here we demonstrated that the p53 family member p63 controls a pathway for p73-dependent cisplatin sensitivity specific to these "triple-negative" tumors. In vivo, DeltaNp63 and TAp73 isoforms were coexpressed exclusively within a subset of triple-negative primary breast cancers that commonly exhibited mutational inactivation of p53. The DeltaNp63alpha isoform promoted survival of breast cancer cells by binding TAp73 and thereby inhibiting its proapoptotic activity. Consequently, inhibition of p63 by RNA interference led to TAp73-dependent induction of proapoptotic Bcl-2 family members and apoptosis. Breast cancer cells expressing DeltaNp63alpha and TAp73 exhibited cisplatin sensitivity that was uniquely dependent on TAp73. Thus, in response to treatment with cisplatin, but not other chemotherapeutic agents, TAp73 underwent c-Abl-dependent phosphorylation, which promoted dissociation of the DeltaNp63alpha/TAp73 protein complex, TAp73-dependent transcription of proapoptotic Bcl-2 family members, and apoptosis. These findings define p63 as a survival factor in a subset of breast cancers; furthermore, they provide what we believe to be a novel mechanism for cisplatin sensitivity in these triple-negative cancers, and they suggest that such cancers may share the cisplatin sensitivity of BRCA1-associated tumors.

The human p73 protein is essential for normal morphogenesis and maintenance of neural tissue. Recently, several TP73 transcripts have been revealed in medulloblastoma (MB), the most common malignant brain tumor in children. Here, we performed immunohistochemical analysis on 29 MB specimens using anti-p73alpha and anti-DeltaNp73 antibodies. Real-time PCR quantification was performed to assess TAp73 and DeltaNp73 transcripts in a subset of 13 MB samples. Normal cerebellar tissues and RNA were used for comparison. Pilot clinical-pathological correlations were also provided. We report significant differences for TAp73 and DeltaNp73 mRNA expression between tumor tissues and reference (P = 0.013, P = 0.028). Immunohistochemically, 52 and 29% MB samples were positive for p73alpha and DeltaNp73, respectively. p73alpha expression was found to be in both the nucleus and cytoplasm, whereas DeltaNp73 was localized predominantly in the cytoplasm. In normal cerebellum, positive staining for p73alpha and DeltaNp73 was observed in the Purkinje cells of newborns, not adult samples, which supports the developmental role of TP73 during organogenesis of the human cerebellum. Survival analysis has shown negative relationship of DeltaNp73-immunoreactivity with overall survival (OS) and event free survival (EFS) (P = 0.026 and P = 0.127, respectively). For p73alpha-positive cases, the negative trend in OS (P = 0.149) and EFS (P = 0.216) was also apparent. Our results indicate the involvement of p73 protein in MB tumorigenesis and define TP73 as a potential prognostic and therapeutic target for medulloblastoma.

The p53 gene and its homologue p73 are rarely mutated in neuroblastoma. In recent studies, we showed that overexpression of DeltaNp73alpha, an isoform lacking the N-terminal transactivation (TA) domain, surprisingly induces p53 protein accumulation in the wild-type (wt) p53 human neuroblastoma line SH-SY5Y. As can be expected owing to its dominant-negative effect, DeltaNp73alpha inhibits Waf1/p21 gene expression, but equally importantly, it upregulates BTG2TIS21/PC3, another p53 target gene. This effect is not observed in neuroblastoma cells that express a mutated p53. To better understand the DeltaNp73-mediated transactivation of the BTG2TIS21/PC3 gene we performed luciferase assays with two reporter plasmids harboring long and short BTG2 promoter sequences in three human neuroblastoma cell lines and one breast cancer cell line. Our results demonstrate that BTG2TIS21/PC3 transactivation by DeltaNp73alpha depends on both p53 status (as it is not observed in a p53-/- neuroblastoma cell line) and cellular context (as it occurs in a p53+/+ neuroblastoma cell line but not in a p53+/+ breast tumor cell line). The fact that DeltaNp73alpha may either inhibit or stimulate wt-p53 transcriptional activity, depending on both the p53 target gene and the cellular context, was confirmed by real-time quantitative PCR. Moreover, transactivation of the BTG2TIS21/PC3 promoter requires a complete DeltaNp73alpha C-terminus sequence as it is not observed with DeltaNp73beta, which lacks most of the C-terminal domain. We have previously shown that DeltaNp73alpha is the only p73 isoform expressed in undifferentiated neuroblastoma tumors. In light of all these findings, we propose that DeltaNp73alpha not only acts as an inhibitor of p53/TAp73 functions in neuroblastoma tumors, but also cooperates with wt-p53 in playing a physiological role through the activation of BTG2TIS21/PC3 gene expression.

p53 family members with a transactivation (TA) domain induce cell cycle arrest and promote apoptosis. However, DeltaNp63 isotypes lacking the TA-domain promote cell proliferation and tumorigenesis in vitro and in vgammavo. Although p53, TAp63 or TAp73 are stabilized upon DNA damage, we found that the genotoxic stress agents induced a dramatic decrease and phosphorylation of DeltaNp63alpha in squamous cell carcinoma cells. Further work revealed that RACK1 physically associated with the p63alpha C-terminal domain through its WD40 domain. However, stratifin binds with phosphorylated DeltaNp63alpha in response to cisplatin. Upon DNA damage induced by cisplatin, stratifin mediated a nuclear export of DeltaNp63alpha into cytoplasm and then RACK1 targeted latter into a proteasome degradation pathway possibly serving as an E3 ubiquitin ligase. Moreover, siRNA knockdown of both stratifin and RACK1 inhibited a nuclear export and protein degradation of DeltaNp63alpha, respectively. Our data suggest that modification and down regulation of DeltaNp63alpha is one of the major determinants of the cellular response to DNA damage in human head and neck cancers.

This study was aimed to determine p73 status in thyroid tumours. Differential expression of the TAp73, DeltaTAp73 transcripts was measured in a panel of 60 thyroid malignancies by quantitative RT-PCR. By comparison to normal thyroid tissue surrounding the tumours, we observed significant downregulation of TP73 transcripts in adenomas and in differentiated carcinomas. Correlations were found in normal tissue specimens between the expression of TAp73 and DeltaNp73 transcripts and that of p53, p14ARF p16INK4a, but these correlations were lost in carcinomas (PTC or FTC). We have found significant variations of TAp73, DeltaNp73, p53, p14ARF p16INK4a, expressions and correlations between the expressions of those different genes in thyroid cancer.

p63 gene is a p53 homologue that encodes proteins with transactivation, DNA-binding and tetramerisation domains. The isoforms TAp63 and TAp73 transactivate p53 target genes and induce apoptosis, whereas the isoforms DeltaNp63 and DeltaNp73 lack transactivation and might have dominant-negative effects in p53 family members. p63 is expressed in germinal centre lymphocytes and can be related to the development of the lymphoma, but the prognostic significance of its expression in the survival of patients with diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) remains unclear. To determine whether quantitative immunohistochemical (IHC) analysis of p63 protein expression correlates with CD10 antigen, Bcl-6 antigen and IRF4 antigen expression and to determine whether p63 is a surrogate predictor of overall survival in high-intermediate and high risk DLBCL populations. CD10, Bcl-6 and IRF4 expression were retrospectively evaluated by IHC in 73 samples of high-intermediate and high risk DLBCL and were used to divide the lymphomas into subgroups of germinal centre B-cell-like (GCB) and activate B-cell-like (ABC) DLBCL. Similarly, p63 expression was evaluated by IHC and the results were compared with subgroups of DLBCL origin and with the survival rates for these patients. p63 was expressed in more than 50% of malignant cells in 11 patients and did not show correlation with subgroups of GCB-like DLBCL or ABC-like DLBCL, but p63(+) patients had better disease-free survival (DFS) than those who were negative (p = 0.01). p63(+) high-intermediate and high risk DLBCL patients have a better DFS than negative cases.

p73 encodes multiple functionally distinct isoforms. Proapoptotic TAp73 isoforms contain a transactivation (TA) domain, and like p53, have tumor suppressor properties and are activated by chemotherapies to induce cell death. In contrast, antiapoptotic DeltaNp73 isoforms lack the TA domain and are dominant-negative inhibitors of p53 and TAp73. DeltaNp73 proteins are overexpressed in a variety of tumors including neuroblastoma. Thus, identification of drugs that upregulate TAp73 and/or downregulate DeltaNp73 represents a potential therapeutic strategy. Here, we report that cyclooxygenase (COX) inhibitors induce apoptosis independent of p53, and differentially modulate endogenous p73 isoforms in neuroblastoma and other tumors. COX inhibitor-mediated apoptosis is associated with the induction of TAp73beta and its target genes. COX inhibitors also downregulate the alternative-spliced DeltaNp73(AS) isoforms, Deltaexon2 and Deltaexon2/3. Furthermore, forced expression of DeltaNp73(AS) results in diminished apoptosis in response to the selective COX-2 inhibitor celecoxib. Celecoxib-mediated downregulation of DeltaNp73(AS) is associated with decreased E2F1 levels and diminished E2F1 activation of the p73 promoter. These results provide the first evidence that COX inhibitors differentially modulate p73 isoforms leading to enhanced apoptosis, and support the potential use of COX inhibitors as novel regulators of p73 to enhance chemosensitivity in tumors with deregulated E2F1 and in those with wild-type (wt) or mutant p53.

Mutations in p73 are rare in cancer. Emerging evidence suggests that the relative expression of various p73 isoforms may contribute to tumorigenesis. Alternative promoters and N-terminal splicing result in the transcription and processing of either full-length (TA) or N-terminally truncated (deltaN) p73 isoforms. TAp73 possesses pro-apoptotic functions, while deltaNp73 has anti-apoptotic properties via functional inhibition of TAp73 and p53. Here, we report that TAp73, but not deltaNp73, is covalently modified by NEDD8 under physiologic conditions in an Mdm2-dependent manner. Co-expression of NEDP1, a cysteine protease that specifically cleaves NEDD8 conjugates, was shown to deneddylate TAp73. In addition, blockage of the endogenous NEDD8 pathway increased TAp73-mediated transactivation of p53- and p73-responsive promoter-driven reporter activity, and in conjunction, neddylated TAp73 species were found preferentially in the cytoplasm. These results suggest that Mdm2 attenuates TAp73 transactivation function, at least in part, by promoting NEDD8-dependent TAp73 cytoplasmic localization and provide the first evidence of a covalent post-translational modification exclusively targeting the TA isoforms of p73.

p53, p63 and p73 are members of the p53 gene family involved in development, differentiation and response to cellular stress. p53 gene is a transcription factor essential for the prevention of cancer formation. The p53 pathway is ubiquitously lost in human cancer either by p53 gene mutation (60% of cancers) or by lost of cell signalling upstream and downstream of p53 in the remaining cancers expressing WTp53 gene. As p53 pathway inactivation is a common denominator to all cancers, the understanding of p53 tumour suppressor activity is likely to bring us closer to cancer therapy. However, despite all the experimental evidences showing the importance of p53 in preventing carcinogenesis, it is difficult in clinical studies to link p53 status to cancer treatment and clinical outcome. The recent discovery that p53 gene encodes for nine different p53 proteins (isoforms) may have a profound impact on our understanding of p53 tumour suppressor activity. Studies in several tumour types have shown that the nine different p53 isoforms are abnormally expressed in tumour tissues compared to normal cells. p53 protein isoforms modulate p53 transcriptional activity and cell fate outcome in response to stress. Regulation of p53 function in normal and tumour tissues in man is likely to be more complex than has been hitherto appreciated. Therefore, the tumour p53 status needs to be determined more accurately by integrating p53 isoform expression, functional p53 mutation analysis and a panel of antibodies specific of p53 and of its target genes.

p63 is a member of the p53 transcription factor family. p63 is expressed from two promoters resulting in proteins with opposite functions: the transcriptionally active TAp63 and the dominant-negative DeltaNp63. Similar to p53, the TAp63 isoforms induce cell cycle arrest and apoptosis. The DeltaNp63 isoforms are dominant-negative variants opposing the activities of p53, TAp63 and TAp73. To avoid unnecessary cell death accompanied by proper response to stress, the expression of the p53 family members must be tightly regulated. NAD(P)H quinone oxidoreductase (NQO1) has recently been shown to interact with and inhibit the degradation of p53. Due to the structural similarities between p53 and p63, we were interested in studying the ability of wild-type and polymorphic, inactive NQO1 to interact with and stabilize p63. We focused on TAp63gamma, as it is the most potent transcription activator and it is expected to have a role in tumor suppression. We show that TAp63gamma can be degraded by the 20S proteasomes. Wild-type but not polymorphic, inactive NQO1 physically interacts with TAp63gamma, stabilizes it and protects it from this degradation. NQO1-mediated TAp63gamma stabilization was especially prominent under stress. Accordingly, we found that downregulation of NQO1 inhibits TAp63gamma-dependant p21 upregulation and TAp63gamma-induced growth arrest stimulated by doxorubicin. Our report is the first to identify this new mechanism demonstrating a physical and functional relationship between NQO1 and the most potent p63 isoform, TAp63gamma. These findings appoint a direct role for NQO1 in the regulation of TAp63gamma expression, especially following stress and may therefore have clinical implications for tumor development and therapy.
