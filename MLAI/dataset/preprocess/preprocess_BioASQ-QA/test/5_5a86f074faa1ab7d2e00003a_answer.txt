IDEAL_ANSWER:
- Genotyping cancer-associated genes in chordoma identifies mutations in oncogenes and areas of chromosomal loss involving CDKN2A, PTEN, and SMARCB1 Loss of SMARCB1/INI1 expression is considered to be a hallmark for childhood chordomas (CCs)
- We therefore sought to identify novel mutations to better understand chordoma biology and to potentially identify therapeutic targets Genotyping cancer-associated genes in chordoma identifies mutations in oncogenes and areas of chromosomal loss involving CDKN2A, PTEN, and SMARCB1
- The diagnosis is all the more challenging that other poorly differentiated cancers lose SMARCB1 expression, such as epithelioid sarcomas (ES), renal medullary carcinomas (RMC) or undifferentiated chordomas (UC) Loss of SMARCB1/INI1 expression is considered to be a hallmark for childhood chordomas (CCs)
- Loss of SMARCB1/INI1 expression is considered to be a hallmark for childhood chordomas (CCs).
