Vanoxerine is a promising, new, investigational antiarrhythmic drug. The purpose of this study was to test the hypothesis that oral dosing of vanoxerine would first terminate induced atrial flutter (AFL) and atrial fibrillation (AF), and then prevent their reinduction. In 5 dogs with sterile pericarditis, on the fourth day after creating the pericarditis, we performed electrophysiologic (EP) studies at baseline, measuring atrial excitability, refractoriness (AERP), and conduction time (CT) when pacing from the right atrial appendage, Bachmann's bundle (BB), and the posteroinferior left atrium at cycle lengths (CLs) of 400, 300, and 200 ms. Then, after induction of AFL or AF, all dogs received hourly oral doses of vanoxerine: 90 mg, followed by 180 mg and 270 mg. Blood was obtained to determine plasma vanoxerine concentrations at baseline, every 30 minutes, when neither AFL nor AF were inducible, and, finally, 1 hour after the 270 mg dose. Then we repeated the baseline EP studies. Four dogs had inducible, sustained AFL, and 1 dog only had induced, nonsustained AF. In 4 AFL episodes, oral vanoxerine terminated the AFL and then rendered it noninducible after an average of 111 minutes (range 75-180 minutes) after the first dose was administered. The mean vanoxerine plasma level at the point of noninducibility was 84 ng/mL, with a narrow range of 76-99 ng/mL. In the dog with induced, nonsustained AF, it was no longer inducible at a drug level of 75 ng/mL. Vanoxerine did not significantly (1) prolong the AERP except at BB, and then only at the faster pacing CLs; (2) change atrial excitability thresholds; (3) prolong atrial conduction time, the PR interval, the QRS complex or the QT interval. Orally administered vanoxerine effectively terminated AFL and rendered it noninducible. It also suppressed inducibility of nonsustained AF. These effects occurred at consistent plasma drug levels. Vanoxerine's insignificant or minimal effects on measured electrophysiologic parameters are consistent with little proarrhythmic risk.

Vanoxerine is an oral, 1,4-dialkylpiperazine derivative antiarrhythmic drug being evaluated for pharmacological cardioversion of atrial fibrillation (AF). The purpose of this study was to evaluate the safety and efficacy of vanoxerine for the restoration of sinus rhythm in subjects with recent onset AF or atrial flutter (AFL). RESTORE SR (randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study to evaluate the safety and efficacy of a single oral dose of vanoxerine for the conversion of subjects with recent onset atrial fibrillation or flutter to normal sinus rhythm) was a prospective, multinational, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial that randomized subjects to a single oral dose of vanoxerine 400 mg or placebo (2:1 allocation). A total of 41 subjects were randomized in the study (placebo [n = 15] and vanoxerine [n = 26]). The study was terminated prematurely because of safety concerns. Overall, 61% (23 of 38) of the treated cohort had a history of AF/AFL and 66% (27 of 41) had structural heart disease (SHD). The primary efficacy end point-conversion to sinus rhythm through 24 hours-occurred in 20% (3 of 15) in the placebo arm vs 69% (18 of 26) in the vanoxerine arm (P = .0024). The mean length of stay was 4.2 ± 2.9 days in the placebo arm vs 4.7 ± 3.2 days in the vanoxerine arm (P = .6561). The primary safety end point (all-cause death, ventricular fibrillation/tachycardia requiring intervention, or torsades de pointes) occurred in no patient in the placebo arm vs 11.5% (3 of 26) in the vanoxerine arm. All 3 patients had torsades de pointes and underlying SHD. Vanoxerine is an oral, mixed ion channel blocker with IKr, INa, and L-type calcium channel activity. While oral therapy with 400 mg of vanoxerine appears effective for the termination of recent onset AF/AFL, its use was associated with a significant risk of ventricular proarrhythmia in patients with SHD.

There remains an unmet need for safe and effective antiarrhythmic drugs, especially for the treatment of atrial fibrillation. Vanoxerine is a drug that is free of adverse cardiac events in normal volunteers, yet is a potent blocker of the hERG (hK(v)11.1) cardiac potassium channel. Consequently,we hypothesized that vanoxerine might also be a potent blocker of cardiac calcium (Ca) and sodium (Na) currents, and would not affect transmural dispersion of repolarization. The whole cell patch clamp technique was used to measure currents from cloned ion channels overexpressed in stable cell lines and single ventricular myocytes. We measured intracellular action potentials from canine ventricular wedges and Purkinje fibers using sharp microelectrode technique. We found that vanoxerine was a potent hK(v)11.1 blocker, and at submicromolar concentrations, it blocked Ca and Na currents in a strongly frequency-dependent manner. In the canine ventricular wedge preparation vanoxerine did not significantly affect transmural action potential waveforms, QT interval or transmural dispersion of repolarization. Vanoxerine (1) is a potent blocker of cardiac hERG, Na and Ca channels; (2) block is strongly frequency-dependent especially for Na and Ca channels; and (3) transmural dispersion of ventricular repolarization is unaffected. The multichannel block and repolarization uniformity resemble the effects of amiodarone, the exemplar atrial fibrillation drug. Vanoxerine is a completely different chemical and has none of amiodarone's toxic effects. Vanoxerine has characteristics of a potentially effective and safe antiarrhythmic.

Vanoxerine produces potent block of cardiac hERG, sodium, and L-type calcium channels. Block is strongly frequency dependent, is unassociated with transmural dispersion of repolarization, and occurs at concentrations safe in humans. Therefore, we proposed that vanoxerine might be antiarrhythmic. In these studies, we tested the hypothesis that vanoxerine would terminate induced atrial fibrillation (AF) and atrial flutter (AFL) in dogs with sterile pericarditis (SP). In 9 SP dogs, 11 episodes each of sustained (>10 minutes) AF and AFL were induced. Electrophysiological studies were performed before and after infusion of vanoxerine, which effectively terminated AF and AFL in 19 of 22 episodes. Simultaneous multisite mapping during 3 AF and 3 AFL episodes demonstrated that termination of each arrhythmia occurred with termination of the driver (a reentrant circuit) following an increase in tachycardia CL. Except for conduction in an area of slow conduction in the driver's reentrant circuit, vanoxerine did not significantly affect intraatrial or atrioventricular conduction time, QRS duration, or QT/QTc intervals. Ventricular refractoriness prolonged minimally during ventricular pacing at 400 and 333 ms (176 +/- 16 ms to 182 +/- 16 ms; 173 +/- 11 ms to 178 +/- 18 ms, respectively). Vanoxerine minimally increased (mean 0.7 mA) atrial stimulus threshold for capture. Vanoxerine effectively terminated induced, sustained AF and AFL in the canine SP model, and produced insignificant or minimal changes in refractoriness, conduction time, or stimulus threshold, consistent with little proarrhythmic risk.

Restoration of sinus rhythm (SR) in patients with atrial fibrillation/atrial flutter (AF/AFL) is limited principally to direct current cardioversion. The multi-ion channel blocker vanoxerine may prove an effective alternative. The purpose of this study was to assess vanoxerine, a 1,4-dialkylpiperazine derivative, for acute conversion of recent-onset, symptomatic AF and AFL. One hundred four subjects with symptomatic AF/AFL for <7 days were randomized sequentially to single oral doses of vanoxerine 200, 300, and 400 mg or placebo. Holter monitors were examined for conversion to SR and proarrhythmia through ≥24 hours. Conversion to SR was dose related: 18.2%, 44.0%, and 52.0% within 4 hours, and 59.1%, 64.0%, and 84.0% within 24 hours, for the 200-, 300-, and 400-mg groups, respectively. This was significantly higher than placebo for the 300- and 400-mg groups within 4 hours (12.5% for placebo; P = .0138 and P = .0028, respectively) and for all doses within 24 hours (31.3% for placebo; P = .0421, P = .0138, P = .0001 for 200-, 300-, and 400-mg vanoxerine groups, respectively). Although vanoxerine caused significant dose-dependent QTcF (QT correction by Fridericia) prolongation, monomorphic or polymorphic ventricular tachycardia did not occur. Adverse events were mild and self-limited, with only the highest dose having a greater frequency than placebo. Oral vanoxerine converted AF/AFL to SR at a high rate, was well tolerated, and caused no ventricular proarrhythmia.

Vanoxerine has been in clinical trials for Parkinsonism, depression and cocaine addiction but lacked efficacy. Although a potent blocker of hERG, it produced no serious adverse events. We attributed the unexpected result to offsetting Multiple Ion Channel Effects (MICE). Vanoxerine's effects were strongly frequency-dependent and we repositioned it for treatment of atrial fibrillation and flutter. Vanoxerine terminated AF/AFL in an animal model and a dose-ranging clinical trial. Reversion to normal rhythm was associated with QT prolongation yet absent proarrhythmia markers for Torsade de Pointes (TdP). To understand the QT/TdP discordance, we used quantitative profiling and compared vanoxerine with dofetilide, a selective hERG-blocking torsadogen used for intractable AF, verapamil, a non-torsadogenic MICE comparator and bepridil, a torsadogenic MICE comparator. At clinically relevant concentrations, verapamil blocked hCav1.2 and hERG, as did vanoxerine and bepridil both of which also blocked hNav1.5. In acute experiments and simulations, dofetilide produced early after depolarizations (EADs) and arrhythmias, whereas verapamil, vanoxerine and bepridil produced no proarrhythmia markers. Of the MICE drugs only bepridil inhibited hERG trafficking following overnight exposure. The results are consistent with the emphasis on MICE of the CiPA assay. Additionally we propose that trafficking inhibition of hERG be added to CiPA.
