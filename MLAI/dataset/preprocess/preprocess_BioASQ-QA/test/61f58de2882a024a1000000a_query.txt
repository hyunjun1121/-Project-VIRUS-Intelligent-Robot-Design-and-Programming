Which factor is inhibited by Milvexian?

[PMID: 34558200]
Milvexian (BMS-986177/JNJ-70033093) is a small molecule, active-site inhibitor of factor XIa (FXIa) being developed to prevent and treat thrombotic events. The safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics (PKs), and pharmacodynamics (PDs) of milvexian were assessed in a two-part, double-blind, placebo-controlled, sequential single ascending dose (SAD) and multiple ascending dose (MAD) study in healthy adults. Participants in SAD panels (6 panels of 8 participants; n = 48) were randomized (3:1) to receive milvexian (4, 20, 60, 200, 300, or 500 mg) or placebo. The 200- and 500-mg panels investigated the pharmacokinetic impact of a high-fat meal. Participants in MAD panels (7 panels of 8 participants; n = 56) were randomized (3:1) to receive milvexian (once- or twice-daily) or placebo for 14 days. All milvexian dosing regimens were safe and well-tolerated, with only mild treatment-emergent adverse events and no clinically significant bleeding events. In SAD panels, maximum milvexian plasma concentration occurred 3 h postdose in all fasted panels. The terminal half-life (T<sub>1/2</sub> ) ranged from 8.3 to 13.8 h. In fasted panels from 20 to 200 mg, absorption was dose-proportional; results at higher doses (300 and 500 mg) were consistent with saturable absorption. Food increased milvexian bioavailability in a dose-dependent fashion. In MAD panels, steady-state milvexian plasma concentration was reached within 3 and 6 dosing days with once- and twice-daily dosing, respectively. Renal excretion was less than 20% in all panels. Prolongation of activated partial thromboplastin time was observed and was directly related to drug exposure. These results suggest that the safety, tolerability, PK, and PD properties of milvexian are suitable for further clinical development.

Milvexian (BMS-986177/JNJ-70033093) is an orally bioavailable factor XIa (FXIa) inhibitor currently in phase 2 clinical trials. To evaluate in vitro properties and in vivo characteristics of milvexian. In vitro properties of milvexian were evaluated with coagulation and enzyme assays, and in vivo profiles were characterized with rabbit models of electrolytic-induced carotid arterial thrombosis and cuticle bleeding time (BT). Milvexian is an active-site, reversible inhibitor of human and rabbit FXIa (K<sub>i</sub> 0.11 and 0.38 nM, respectively). Milvexian increased activated partial thromboplastin time (APTT) without changing prothrombin time and potently prolonged plasma APTT in humans and rabbits. Milvexian did not alter platelet aggregation to ADP, arachidonic acid, or collagen. Milvexian was evaluated for in vivo prevention and treatment of thrombosis. For prevention, milvexian 0.063 + 0.04, 0.25 + 0.17, and 1 + 0.67 mg/kg+mg/kg/h preserved 32 ± 6*, 54 ± 10*, and 76 ± 5%* of carotid blood flow (CBF) and reduced thrombus weight by 15 ± 10*, 45 ± 2*, and 70 ± 4%*, respectively (*p < .05; n = 6/dose). For treatment, thrombosis was initiated for 15 min and CBF decreased to 40% of control. Seventy-five minutes after milvexian administration, CBF averaged 1 ± 0.3, 39 ± 10, and 66 ± 2%* in groups treated with vehicle and milvexian 0.25 + 0.17 and 1 + 0.67 mg/kg+mg/kg/h, respectively (*p < .05 vs. vehicle; n = 6/group). The combination of milvexian 1 + 0.67 mg/kg+mg/kg/h and aspirin 4 mg/kg/h intravenous did not increase BT versus aspirin monotherapy. Milvexian is an effective antithrombotic agent with limited impact on hemostasis, even when combined with aspirin in rabbits. This study supports inhibition of FXIa with milvexian as a promising antithrombotic therapy with a wide therapeutic window.

Factor XIa (FXIa) is an enzyme in the coagulation cascade thought to amplify thrombin generation but has a limited role in hemostasis. From preclinical models and human genetics, an inhibitor of FXIa has the potential to be an antithrombotic agent with superior efficacy and safety. Reversible and irreversible inhibitors of FXIa have demonstrated excellent antithrombotic efficacy without increased bleeding time in animal models (Weitz, J. I., Chan, N. C. <i>Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc. Biol.</i> 2019, 39 (1), 7-12). Herein, we report the discovery of a novel series of macrocyclic FXIa inhibitors containing a pyrazole P2' moiety. Optimization of the series for (pharmacokinetic) PK properties, free fraction, and solubility resulted in the identification of <b>milvexian</b> (<b>BMS-986177/JNJ-70033093</b>, <b>17</b>, FXIa <i>K</i><sub>i</sub> = 0.11 nM) as a clinical candidate for the prevention and treatment of thromboembolic disorders, suitable for oral administration.

Factor XIa inhibitors for the prevention and treatment of venous and arterial thromboembolism may be more effective and result in less bleeding than conventional anticoagulants. Additional data are needed regarding the efficacy and safety of milvexian, an oral factor XIa inhibitor. In this parallel-group, phase 2 trial, we randomly assigned 1242 patients undergoing knee arthroplasty to receive one of seven postoperative regimens of milvexian (25 mg, 50 mg, 100 mg, or 200 mg twice daily or 25 mg, 50 mg, or 200 mg once daily) or enoxaparin (40 mg once daily). The primary efficacy outcome was venous thromboembolism (which was a composite of asymptomatic deep-vein thrombosis, confirmed symptomatic venous thromboembolism, or death from any cause). The principal safety outcome was bleeding. Among the patients receiving milvexian twice daily, venous thromboembolism developed in 27 of 129 (21%) taking 25 mg, in 14 of 124 (11%) taking 50 mg, in 12 of 134 (9%) taking 100 mg, and in 10 of 131 (8%) taking 200 mg. Among those receiving milvexian once daily, venous thromboembolism developed in 7 of 28 (25%) taking 25 mg, in 30 of 127 (24%) taking 50 mg, and in 8 of 123 (7%) taking 200 mg, as compared with 54 of 252 patients (21%) taking enoxaparin. The dose-response relationship with twice-daily milvexian was significant (one-sided P<0.001), and the 12% incidence of venous thromboembolism with twice-daily milvexian was significantly lower than the prespecified benchmark of 30% (one-sided P<0.001). Bleeding of any severity occurred in 38 of 923 patients (4%) taking milvexian and in 12 of 296 patients (4%) taking enoxaparin; major or clinically relevant nonmajor bleeding occurred in 1% and 2%, respectively; and serious adverse events were reported in 2% and 4%, respectively. Postoperative factor XIa inhibition with oral milvexian in patients undergoing knee arthroplasty was effective for the prevention of venous thromboembolism and was associated with a low risk of bleeding.
