What is the mode of inheritance in Fanconi anemia?

[PMID: 22693659]
Fanconi anemia (FA) is a rare inherited syndrome with diverse clinical symptoms including developmental defects, short stature, bone marrow failure, and a high risk of malignancies. Fifteen genetic subtypes have been distinguished so far. The mode of inheritance for all subtypes is autosomal recessive, except for FA-B, which is X-linked. Cells derived from FA patients are-by definition-hypersensitive to DNA cross-linking agents, such as mitomycin C, diepoxybutane, or cisplatinum, which becomes manifest as excessive growth inhibition, cell cycle arrest, and chromosomal breakage upon cellular exposure to these drugs. Here we provide a detailed laboratory protocol for the accurate assessment of the FA diagnosis as based on mitomycin C-induced chromosomal breakage analysis in whole-blood cultures. The method also enables a quantitative estimate of the degree of mosaicism in the lymphocyte compartment of the patient.

The familial occurrence of duodenal atresia is uncommon. This study evaluated the inheritance patterns, the nature and associations, and the presence of immunologic deficits in duodenal atresia recurring in at least three siblings each in two nonrelated families. In the first family, an association with Fanconi's anemia was observed in three of seven pregnancies (2 boys, 1 girl) suggesting an autosomal recessive mode of transmission. Patients died as a result of overwhelming (fungal) septicemia in association with pancytopenia. In a second family, identical multiple atresias occurred in two female siblings born 18 months apart and a third child with a duodenal stenosis. Overwhelming sepsis and a T-cell dysfunction was seen in the postoperative period, which had partially corrected by follow-up at 5 months. A history of family occurrence of duodenal atresia should alert the physician to the possibility of associated pathology including immune deficiency states.

A Bayesian solution for making inferences about segregation parameters with no information about the ascertainment is presented. Inferences about the segregation probability and the probability of being sporadic are made through the posterior marginal distribution of these parameters after integrating out the ascertainment probability, the nuisance parameter. The method was tested with real and simulated data and performed well. Original Fanconi anemia data, for which no information about the ascertainment was available, were then analyzed, with results that confirmed a monogenic autosomal recessive mode of inheritance.

Fanconi anemia (FA) is a rare genetic disease, transmitted in an autosomal recessive mode. The clinical phenotype is very broad and heterogeneous, related to the wide range of genes involved in this pathology. The classical triad of short height, physical abnormalities, and bone marrow failure is suggestive. The main physical abnormalities found involve the limbs, spinal column, skin, kidneys and urinary tract, and the ORL zone. Recent progress in molecular biology has identified 15 genes whose mutation causes FA chromosomal instability. FA is diagnosed by cytogenetic examination, then specified by molecular analysis. As FA patients may present multiorgan abnormalities and a high risk for neoplasia development, their medical follow-up has to be multidisciplinary and prolonged throughout life. The main challenges of the follow-up are patient information and education. Bone marrow failure, appearing during the first decade, requires close hematological monitoring and for severe cases requires hematopoietic stem cell transplantation, major and specific care with frequent serious complications and high mortality, but this is the only curative treatment in FA. Extrahematological care consists in screening for organ abnormalities and defects as well as monitoring precancerous lesions and tumors.

Fanconi anemia is an autosomal recessive syndrome characterized by diverse clinical symptoms, hypersensitivity to DNA crosslinking agents, chromosomal instability and susceptibility to cancer. Fanconi anemia has at least 11 complementation groups (A, B, C, D1, D2, E, F, G, I, J, L); the genes mutated in 8 of these have been identified. The gene BRCA2 was suggested to underlie complementation group B, but the evidence is inconclusive. Here we show that the protein defective in individuals with Fanconi anemia belonging to complementation group B is an essential component of the nuclear protein 'core complex' responsible for monoubiquitination of FANCD2, a key event in the DNA-damage response pathway associated with Fanconi anemia and BRCA. Unexpectedly, the gene encoding this protein, FANCB, is localized at Xp22.31 and subject to X-chromosome inactivation. X-linked inheritance has important consequences for genetic counseling of families with Fanconi anemia belonging to complementation group B. Its presence as a single active copy and essentiality for a functional Fanconi anemia-BRCA pathway make FANCB a potentially vulnerable component of the cellular machinery that maintains genomic integrity.

The formal genetics of Fanconi's anemia were investigated on the basis of 21 families from different European countries, and of 69 families from the literature. 1. The result of segregation analysis is compatible with the hypothesis of a simple autosomal recessive mode of inheritance. 2. The number of sporadic cases is not greater than expected. 3. Among the affected siblings in the sibships analyzed, males are somewhat more frequent than females. However, this sex difference is also found among the unaffected siblings, and it is not statistically significant. 4. Contrary to assertions made in the literature, there is no clustering of affected in the sequence of siblings, no maternal age effect, and no preference of higher birth orders. 5. A high intrafamilial correlation for age at onset, and (very probably) number and severity of malformations points to genetic heterogeneity. Apart from the standard type, an especially mild type with late onset, few malformations, and a relatively benign course seems to exist. Its counterpart is possibly an especially severe type with early onset, many malformations, and a malignant course. However, definite conclusions on the special character of this heterogeneity will require application of additional methods.

Fanconi anemia (FA) is a rare genetic disease with both autosomal and X-linked inheritance, characterized by genomic instability. The cells from individuals with FA are highly sensitive to DNA-crosslinking drugs, such as mitomycin C (MMC), diepoxybutane (DEB) and so on. Now at least 13 genes (FA-A, B, C, D1, D2, E, F, G, I, J, L, M, N) have been identified, whose products participate in a DNA damage-response network involving breast cancer susceptibility gene products, BRCA1 and BRCA2. The impaired DNA repair due to mutations in FA genes is thought to be one of the main pathogenesis of FA, also closely related to the development of some cancers. In this review, the advances of study about FA-BRCA network are summarized.

We report two sisters affected with a unique disorder characterized by recurrent space-occupying brain lesions and retinal vasculopathy since their early twenties. Affection status was associated with abnormalities characteristic of Fanconi's anemia, i.e. aplastic anemia, microcephaly, short stature, an unusual face and pigmentation abnormalities of skin. In cytogenetic analyses performed in childhood signs of chromosome fragility or any chromosomal aberration were lacking. Histopathological examination of brain biopsy samples in both cases demonstrated identical histomorphological features of an unusual occlusive vasculopathy with multilayered basement membranes and coagulation necroses which were confined to the white matter. A veno-occlusive retinopathy with neovascularization attributed to progressive visual loss. One of the sisters died at an age of just 24 years, the other is now 27 years old. Unlike any other published cases of hereditary cerebroretinal vasculopathy, the sisters' complex early-onset vaso-occlusive CNS-/eye-disease seems to be genetically associated with their Fanconi's anemia-like phenotypes and is suggested to constitute an autosomal-recessive variant. Patchy white matter calcifications, an incidental finding in either of the affected sisters, may represent preclinical manifestation of disease onset in childhood.

Fanconi anemia (FA) is a recessively inherited syndrome with predisposition to bone marrow failure and malignancies. Hypersensitivity to cross-linking agents is a cellular feature used to confirm the diagnosis. The mode of inheritance is autosomal recessive (12 subtypes) as well as X-linked (one subtype). Most genetic subtypes have initially been defined as "complementation groups" by cell fusion studies. Here we report a comprehensive genetic subtyping approach for FA that is primarily based on mutation screening, supplemented by protein expression analysis and by functional assays to test for pathogenicity of unclassified variants. Of 80 FA cases analyzed, 73 (91%) were successfully subtyped. In total, 92 distinct mutations were detected, of which 56 were novel (40 in FANCA, eight in FANCC, two in FANCD1, three in FANCE, one in FANCF, and three in FANCG). All known complementation groups were represented, except D2, J, L, and M. Three patients could not be classified because proliferating cell cultures from the probands were lacking. In cell lines from the remaining four patients, immunoblotting was used to determine their capacity to monoubiquitinate FANCD2. In one case FANCD2 monoubiquitination was normal, indicating a defect downstream. In the remaining three cases monoubiquitination was not detectable, indicating a defect upstream. In the latter four patients, pathogenic mutations in a known FA gene may have been missed, or these patients might represent novel genetic subtypes. We conclude that direct mutation screening allows a molecular diagnosis of FA in the vast majority of patients, even in cases where growing cells from affected individuals are unavailable. Proliferating cell lines are required in a minority (<15%) of the patients, to allow testing for FANCD2 ubiquitination status and sequencing of FANCD2 using cDNA, to avoid interference from pseudogenes.

Fanconi anemia (FA), a recessive syndrome with both autosomal and X-linked inheritance, features diverse clinical symptoms, such as progressive bone marrow failure, hypersensitivity to DNA cross-linking agents, chromosomal instability and susceptibility to cancer. At least 12 genetic subtypes have been described (FA-A, B, C, D1, D2, E, F, G, I, J, L, M) and all except FA-I have been linked to a distinct gene. Most FA proteins form a complex that activates the FANCD2 protein via monoubiquitination, while FANCJ and FANCD1/BRCA2 function downstream of this step. The FA proteins typically lack functional domains, except for FANCJ/BRIP1 and FANCM, which are DNA helicases, and FANCL, which is probably an E3 ubiquitin conjugating enzyme. Based on the hypersensitivity to cross-linking agents, the FA proteins are thought to function in the repair of DNA interstrand cross-links, which block the progression of DNA replication forks. Here we present a hypothetical model, which not only describes the assembly of the FA pathway, but also positions this pathway in the broader context of DNA cross-link repair. Finally, the possible role for the FA pathway, in particular FANCF and FANCB, in the origin of sporadic cancer is discussed.
