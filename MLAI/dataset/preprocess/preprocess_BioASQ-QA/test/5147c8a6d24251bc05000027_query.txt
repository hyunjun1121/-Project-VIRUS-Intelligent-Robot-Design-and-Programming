Which enzyme is deficient in Krabbe disease?

[PMID: 9441867]
Galactocerebrosidase (GALC) is the lysosomal enzyme deficient in human and certain animal species with globoid cell leukodystrophy (GLD) or Krabbe disease. It catalyzes the hydrolysis of specific galactolipids including galactosylceramide and psychosine. The GALC protein is found in very low amounts in all tissues, which delayed its purification and the subsequent cloning of its cDNA and gene. We previously published the exon-intron organization of the human gene, but did not functionally analyze the 5' flanking region. We now provide a description of this GC-rich region which includes one potential YY1 element and one potential SP1 binding site. There are 13 GGC trinucleotides within the first 150 bp preceding the initiation codon. The 5' end of intron 1 contains six potential Sp1 binding sites, one AP1 binding site, and eight AP2 binding sites. A construct containing nucleotides -176 to -24 had the strongest promoter activity using a vector containing the chloramphenicol acetyltransferase reporter gene. We also provide evidence for the presence of inhibitory sequences located immediately upstream of the promoter region, and within the first 234 nucleotides of intron 1. These elements together with a suboptimal nucleotide at position +4 may explain the low level of GALC protein in all cell types.

Krabbe disease, or globoid cell leukodystrophy, is an autosomal recessive disorder caused by the deficiency of galactocerebrosidase (GALC) activity. Although most cases are diagnosed in infancy and show a fatal outcome in childhood, adult patients have been identified, showing progressive spastic hemiparesis to tetraparesis, followed by optic atrophy, dementia, and neuropathy. The disease can be diagnosed by detecting the deficiency of GALC activity (less than 5% of normal) in any available tissue sample. The cloning of the human GALC gene allowed the molecular characterization of newly diagnosed patients. More than 75 disease-causing mutations and polymorphisms in this gene have been identified. To describe a 28-year-old woman with Krabbe disease, correlating clinical and biochemical abnormalities to a novel mutation on the GALC gene. Clinical investigation was enriched by neurophysiological and neuroimaging data. The activity of GALC was assayed in white blood cells using radiolabeled natural substrate. Genomic DNA was isolated from peripheral blood, and the GALC gene was sequenced. The mutated gene was expressed and GALC activity was measured in transfected COS-1 cells. The patient had progressive and bilateral amaurosis starting at 8 years of age. Although she was experiencing weakness in all her extremities, her intellect remained intact. She was found to be homozygous for a previously unreported missense mutation (T1886G), which leads to low, but not totally deficient, GALC activity. Expression of this mutation in COS-1 cells using the pcDNA3 expression vector (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, Calif) resulted in low, although not null, GALC activity, which can explain the protracted clinical course in this patient. Patients carrying the mutation described herein might be potential candidates for therapeutic trials, such as bone marrow transplantation or gene therapy.

Krabbe disease (globoid-cell leukodystrophy; GLD) is caused by mutations in the GALC gene. Beta-galactocerebrosidase (GALC) is a specific beta-galactosidase which is defective in GLD. About 90% of GLD patients have an infantile course by fatal cerebral demyelination, but 10% have a later onset (LOGLD) of symptoms and survive for one or several decades. Activities of GALC towards galactosylceramide (GC) and galactosylsphingosine (psychosine; PS) were determined in white blood cells and cultured fibroblasts derived from GLD patients and controls using tritium-labelled natural substrates. In the galactosylsphingosine (psychosine) beta-galactosidase (GALC-PS) assay, a thin layer chromatographic technique was used to separate enzymatically released radioactive galactose. Both galactosylceramide beta-galactosidase (GALC-GC) and GALC-PS activities were reduced by at least 85% of the normal in all but 2 of the 10 GLD patients studied. In particular, one 23-year-old severely demyelinated LOGLD patient was strongly deficient (11% of the normal) in GALC-GC but apparently normal for GALC-PS activity. This patient's GALC genotype was the 30-kb-deleted/502T allele combined with a wild-type allele in the 1637C background known to slightly reduce GALC-GC activity. Further, of six LOGLD patients, both of 62- and 63-year-old brothers had the deleted allele combined with an 809G>A mutated 1637C allele. The sibs had strongly reduced GALC-GC and GALC-PS activities but became clinically remarkable only in their 50s with a severe mental downhill course in one of them. A GALC genotype with one deleted and one polymorphic GALC activity-reducing allele can lead to enzymatic and clinical signs of LOGLD in the absence of marked GALC-PS deficiency. If an active PS hydrolysis in the fibroblasts of a LOGLD patient also reflected such hydrolysis in the brain, the psychosine hypothesis for GLD may need to be revised.

6-Hexadecanoylamino-4-methylumbelliferyl-beta-D-galactopyranoside (HMGal) has been shown to be a specific fluorogenic substrate of galactocerebrosidase and to facilitate the simple enzymatic diagnosis of Krabbe disease in human patients and in twitcher mice. HMGal hydrolysis at pH 4.5 is optimally stimulated by sodium taurocholate (0.25%) and oleic acid (0.05%) with a Km of 0.150, 0.04 and 0.03 mM, respectively for control mouse kidney, human fibroblasts and leukocytes. In control samples, the specific activity (nmol/mg prot./h) for HMGal is higher than for the natural substrate, galactocerebroside, and is severely deficient in the twitcher mouse and in patients with Krabbe disease. Comparative investigation of galactocerebrosidase activity in fibroblasts, leukocytes and brain with radioactive and fluorogenic substrates reveals a good agreement between the results of the two methods. Galactocerebroside (Gal-Cer) is a competitive inhibitor of HMGal hydrolysis in mouse kidney homogenates while GM1-ganglioside has no inhibitory effect in the same assay system. The sensitivity and specificity of this fluorogenic substrate for galactocerebrosidase provides a simple and rapid method for the diagnosis of Krabbe disease, and for the purification of this enzyme from normal tissues.

Krabbe disease is a lethal, demyelinating condition caused by genetic deficiency of galactocerebrosidase (GALC) and resultant accumulation of its cytotoxic substrate, psychosine (galactosylsphingosine), primarily in oligodendrocytes (OLs). Psychosine is generated by galactosylation of sphingosine by UDP-galactose:ceramide galactosyltransferase (CGT), a galactosylceramide synthesizing enzyme which is primarily expressed in OLs. The expression of CGT and the synthesis of galactosyl-sphingolipids are associated with the terminal differentiation of OL, but little is known about the participation of endogenous psychosine accumulation in OL differentiation under GALC deficient conditions. In this study, we report that accumulation of endogenous psychosine under GALC deficient Krabbe conditions impedes OL differentiation process both by decreasing the expression of myelin lipids and protein and by inducing the cell death of maturating OLs. The psychosine pathology under GALC deficient conditions involves participation of secretory phospholipase A2 (sPLA2) activation and increase in its metabolites, as evidenced by attenuation of psychosine-induced pathology by treatment with pharmacological inhibitor of sPLA2 7,7-dimethyleicosadienoic acid (DEDA). These observations suggest for potential therapeutic efficacy of sPLA2 inhibitor in Krabbe disease.

Globoid cell leukodystrophy, or Krabbe disease, is a severe disorder of the peripheral and central nervous system myelin caused by deficient galactocerebrosidase (GALC) activity. This autosomal recessive disease affects humans and animals including dogs, mice, and rhesus monkeys. Cloning of the human and animal GALC genes opened opportunities for therapeutic trials using animal models. We describe the clinical, pathologic, and biochemical features of the affected rhesus monkey. Affected monkeys had very low GALC activity and a two base pair deletion in both copies of the GALC gene. Clinical signs of tremors, hypertonia, and incoordination led to humane euthanasia by 5 months of age. At necropsy, peripheral nerves were enlarged. Microscopically, the cerebral, cerebellar, and spinal cord white matter was infiltrated with periodic acid-Schiff-positive multinucleated globoid cells, and there was a striking lack of myelin. Peripheral nerve fibers were decreased in number and separated by Alcian blue- and safranin O-positive material. Myelin sheaths were greatly diminished. Lipid analysis of brains of 12-day-old and 158-day-old affected monkeys revealed a great excess of psychosine in white matter. The rhesus monkey model will be especially useful for exploring treatment options, including prenatal bone marrow transplantation and various approaches to gene therapy.

Krabbe disease is an extremely rare condition with an incidence of 1 in 1,00,000 live births. It is caused by deficient activity of the Iysosomal hydrolase galactosylceramide beta-galactosidase. A 6 years old male weighing 12 kg, was brought to Rajah Muthiah Medical College and Hospital with complaints of convulsions. The full-term child was delivered by lower segment caesarean section to second-degree consanguineous parents. The baby cried immediately after birth. The child attained normal milestones till two years of age. Thereafter he lost his attained milestones. The child had dysmorphic face with features like anti-Mongoloid eyes and teeth anomaly. Skin was lax all over the body especially over the face and was bruised. Respiratory distress and upward gaze were present. Bilateral crepitations were heard. Pupils were dilated and sluggishly reacted to light.

Galactocerebrosidase (GALC) is deficient in all tissues from human patients and animal models with globoid cell leukodystrophy (GLD) or Krabbe disease. The deficiency results in decreased lysosomal catabolism of certain galactolipids including galactosylceramide and psychosine that are synthesized maximally during myelination. According to current theories, the accumulation of psychosine in humans and animals with GLD induces oligodendrocyte degeneration and myelination ceases. Transduction of oligodendrocytes from twitcher mice with a retroviral vector containing the GALC cDNA can correct the enzyme deficiency in these cells. Our data show that twitcher astrocytes and oligodendrocytes can internalize exogenous GALC, as well as donate the enzyme to the mutant glial cells. Antibodies against human GALC localized the GALC antigen in retrovirally transduced cells and cells receiving enzyme via cell to cell secretion and uptake to the lysosomal fraction. In fact immunocytochemical studies in transduced oligodendrocytes revealed that the GALC colocalizes in vesicles lysosomal-associated membrane protein-2 (LAMP2) (+). Moreover, labeling cells with anti-GALC and a marker for oligodendrocytes demonstrated that, upon differentiation, transduced, twitcher oligodendrocytes attained the normal branched process configuration, while untransduced cells show only abnormal morphology. Phenotype correction in mutant oligodendrocytes has also been observed after enzyme transfer. These studies indicate that GALC activity supplied to cultured oligodendrocytes from twitcher mice by different methods can correct the pathological phenotype of these cells.

Globoid-cell leukodystrophy (GLD) is an autosomal recessive inherited disorder caused by the deficiency of galactocerebrosidase, the lysosomal enzyme responsible for the degradation of the myelin glycolipid galactocerebroside. Although the most common form of the disease is the classical infantile form (Krabbe disease), later-onset forms also have been described. We have analyzed the galactocerebrosidase gene in 17 patients (nine families) with late-onset GLD and in 1 patient with classical Krabbe disease. Half of the patients were heterozygous for the large gene deletion associated with the 502C-->T polymorphism, the most common mutation in infantile patients. Several novel mutations that result in deficient galactocerebrosidase activity were also identified in these patients. They include the missense mutations R63H, G95S, M101L, G268S, Y298C, and I234T; the nonsense mutation S7X; a one-base deletion (805delG); a mutation that interferes with the splicing of intron 1; and a 34-nt insertion in the RNA, caused by the aberrant splicing of intron 6. All of these genetic defects are clustered in the first 10 exons of the galactocerebrosidase gene and therefore affect the 50-kD subunit of the mature enzyme. Studies on the distribution and enzymatic activity of the polymorphic alleles 1637T/C (I546/T546) provided support for previous data that had indicated the existence of two galactocerebrosidase forms with different catalytic activities in the general population. Our data also indicate that the mutations occur preferentially in the "low activity" 1637C allele.

The inherited deficiency of galactosylceramide beta-galactosidase (E.C. 3.2.1.46: galactocerebrosidase) activity results in globoid cell leukodystrophy in humans (Krabbe disease) and in mice (twitcher mutant). To determine whether Krabbe patients' cells complement twitcher cells to produce, in hybrid combination, greater than deficient levels of galactocerebrosidase activity, five separate crosses were made between an established twitcher mouse cell line and five cell strains from unrelated Krabbe disease patients. A total of 57 twitcher mouse/Krabbe somatic cell hybrid lines developed from all of these crosses were deficient in galactocerebrosidase activity despite the presence of human chromosomes 14 or 17, which have been previously implicated as bearing the galactocerebrosidase gene. A control cross between twitcher mouse/positive control human fibroblasts resulted in 14 of 21 independent hybrid lines that expressed higher than deficient levels of galactocerebrosidase activity. The lack of complementation between Krabbe disease patient and twitcher mutant mouse cells provides further evidence that the twitcher mouse is an authentic murine model for Krabbe disease and supports the hypothesis that the mutations in both species are within the structural gene for the galactocerebrosidase enzyme.

Globoid cell leukodystrophy (Krabbe disease) is characterized by the accumulation of a toxic metabolite, psychosine (galactosylsphingosine), which is a substrate for the deficient enzyme (galactocerebroside beta-galactosidase). This study underscores the possible role of psychosine in the effect of inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) -derived NO in the pathophysiology of this demyelinating disease. For the first time, we provide evidence of the expression of iNOS in CNS of Krabbe patient and show that the iNOS-expressing cells in the CNS were astrocytes. Psychosine potentiated the LPS-induced production of proinflammatory cytokines (IL-1beta, IL-6, and TNF-alpha) in primary rat astrocytes and regulated the cytokine-mediated production of NO in C6 glioma and primary rat astrocyte. Psychosine induced cytokine-mediated nuclear translocation of AP-1 and C/EBP by potentiating the expression of Fra-1 and C/EBP-delta proteins. This suggests that psychosine maintained or sustained the cytokine-primed expression of iNOS by further potentiating the nuclear translocation of AP-1 and C/EBP without modulating the cytokine-mediated transcription activity of NF-kappaB. This study hypothesizes that accumulated psychosine leads to production of cytokines and iNOS expression. The ensuing excessive production of NO and ONOO- may play a role in pathogenesis of Krabbe disease.

Galactocerebrosidase (GALC) activity is deficient in all patients with globoid cell leukodystrophy (GLD). While most patients have the severe infantile form of this autosomal recessive disorder (Krabbe disease), patients up to 50 years of age have been diagnosed in this laboratory. With the cloning of the GALC cDNA and availability of information regarding the gene organization, patients can be evaluated for their disease-causing mutations. We now report that a large deletion, together with a polymorphic C to T transition at position 502 of cDNA (counting from the A of the initiation codon), is responsible for a large number of disease-causing alleles in patients with Krabbe disease. Of 48 patients evaluated, 10 were found to be homozygous for the 502/del allele, five patients were heterozygous for this allele, 21 patients were heterozygous for the 502 mutation (presence of the deletion could not be confirmed), and one infantile patient was homozygous for the 502 mutation but at least one allele was not deleted. No patient was found to have the deletion without the 502 polymorphism. The delineation of mutations causing infantile Krabbe disease will provide new information regarding structure-function relationships in this multi-subunit enzyme and will improve the identification of patients and carriers in some families.

Krabbe disease is an autosomal recessive inherited demyelinating disease, which is deficient in lysosomal enzyme, galactocerebrosidase. Pathophysiological characteristics of this disease are extreme demyelination in white matter and peripheral nerve, existence of globoid cells, absence of accumulation of main substrates, i.e. galactocerebrosidase in tissues and accumulation of psychosine. Molecular basis of this disease including isolation of a cDNA for human and murine galactocerebrosidase and cloning of genome of this gene are reviewed. The trial of gene therapy on twitcher, the mouse model of Krabbe disease, could break through on therapy on this progressive demyelinating disease.

Galactosylceramide beta-galactosidase cross reacting material was demonstrated in brain, liver, and skin fibroblasts from patients with Krabbe disease. The mutant enzyme was antigenically identical to the normal enzyme and exhibited similar electrophoretic mobility. Normal quantities of the catalytically deficient enzyme were measured in the patients' tissues by a sensitive single radial immunodiffusion assay, indicating that the mutation is in structural gene for the enzyme protein.

Lipid rafts (LRs) are membrane realms characterized by high concentrations of cholesterol and sphingolipids. Often, they are portrayed as scaffolds on which many different signaling molecules can assemble their cascades. The idea of rafts as scaffolds is garnering significant attention as the consequences of LR disruption have been shown to be manifest in multiple signaling pathways. In this study, LRs in the brain of the twitcher (TWI) mouse, a bona-fide model for infant variants of human globoid cell leukodystrophy or Krabbe disease, were investigated. This mouse has deficient activity of GALC (beta-galactosylceramidase) that leads to a progressive accumulation of some galactosyl-sphingolipids in the brain. We hypothesized that the accumulation of psychosine (galactosyl-sphingosine) in the TWI CNS may result in the disruption of rafts in different cell populations such as neurons and oligodendrocytes, both cellular targets during disease. In this communication, we demonstrate that psychosine specifically accumulates in LRs in the TWI brain and sciatic nerve and in samples from brains of human Krabbe patients. It is also shown that this accumulation is accompanied by an increase in cholesterol in these domains and changes in the distribution of the LR markers flotillin-2 and caveolin-1. Finally, we show evidence that this phenomenon may provide a mechanism by which psychosine can exert its known inhibitory effect on protein kinase C. This study provides a previously undescribed biophysical aspect for the mechanism of pathogenesis in Krabbe disease.

Globoid cell leukodystrophy (Krabbe disease) is an inherited neurological disorder caused by the pathogenomic accumulation of psychosine (galactosylsphingosine), a substrate for the deficient enzyme galactocerebroside beta-galactosidase. This study underscores the mechanism of action of psychosine in the regulation of oligodendrocyte cell death via the generation of lysophosphatidylcholine (LPC) and arachidonic acid (AA) by the activation of secretory phospholipase A2 (sPLA2). There was a significant increase in the level of LPC, indicating a phospholipase A2 (PLA2)-dependent pathobiology, in the brains of Krabbe disease patients and those of twitcher mice, an animal model of Krabbe disease. In vitro studies of the treatment of primary oligodendrocytes and the oligodendrocyte MO3.13 cell line with psychosine also showed the generation of LPC and the release of AA in a dose- and time-dependent manner, indicating psychosine-induced activation of PLA2. Studies with various pharmacological inhibitors of cytosolic phospholipase A2 and sPLA2 and psychosine-mediated induction of sPLA2 enzymatic activity in media supernatant suggest that psychosine-induced release of AA and generation of LPC is mainly contributed by sPLA2. An inhibitor of sPLA2, 7,7-dimethyl eicosadienoic acid, completely attenuated the psychosine-mediated accumulation of LPC levels, release of AA, and generation of reactive oxygen species, and blocked oligodendroyte cell death, as evident from cell survival, DNA fragmentation, and caspase 3 activity assays. This study documents for the first time that psychosine-induced cell death is mediated via the sPLA2 signaling pathway and that inhibitors of sPLA2 may hold a therapeutic potential for protection against oligodendrocyte cell death and resulting demyelination in Krabbe disease.

Human galactocerebrosidase, the enzyme deficient in Krabbe disease, was purified, through several hydrophobic column steps and gel filtration, 22,650-fold from human lymphocytes. Using information on its N-terminal and internal amino acid sequences, and the polymerase chain reaction method, we cloned a full-length cDNA for the enzyme. The deduced amino acid sequence matched all amino acid sequences determined. The 3780 nucleotide sequence included 2007 nucleotides which encoded a single chain peptide of 669 amino acid residues with a 26 amino acid N-terminal signal peptide and six potential asparagine-linked glycosylation sites. The galactocerebrosidase cDNA detected an about 4 kb mRNA band material in human cultured skin fibroblasts. A nonsense mutation was found at codon 369 (GAA-->TAA) in the coding sequence of cDNA amplified from cultured skin fibroblast mRNA from a patient with typical Krabbe disease.

Globoid cell leukodystrophy (Krabbe disease) is an autosomal recessive disorder resulting from the deficiency of galactocerebrosidase (GALC) activity. GALC is responsible for the lysosomal catabolism of galactosylceramide, a major lipid in myelin, kidney and epithelial cells of small intestine and colon. We describe the molecular cloning of human GALC cDNA and its expression in COS-1 cells. Degenerate PCR primers, derived from N-terminal amino acid sequence from the 51 kDa band from human brain, were used to amplify cat testes RNA, and the resulting product was used to screen human testes and brain libraries. Two overlapping clones contained the total protein coding region, while additional clones and PCR amplification were needed to obtain the complete 3' end of the cDNA. The 3795 bp obtained include 47 bp 5' to the initiation start site, 2007 bp of open reading frame (coding for 669 amino acids), and 1741 bp of 3' untranslated sequence. Modification of the sequence surrounding the initiation codon to one more favorable for expression, resulted in a 6-fold increase in GALC activity in transfected COS-1 cells. The isolation of this clone will permit investigations into the causes for GALC deficiency in humans and available animal models, development of more accurate tests for patient and carrier identification, and evaluation of methods for effectively treating GALC deficiency, initially using the animal models.

Globoid cell leukodystrophy (GCL or Krabbe disease) is a recessive disease caused by mutations of the lysosomal enzyme galactocerebrosidase (GALC) and twitcher is the murine model of GCL. We have prepared retroviral packaging cell lines to transduce the GALC gene. Retroviral transduction restored GALC activity in GCL fibroblasts and increased such activity to very high levels in immortalized neural progenitor cells (ST14A cells). GALC activity was also normalized in twitcher fibroblasts co-cultured with ST14A cells over-expressing GALC, demonstrating that this enzyme is secreted and can be imported efficiently by GALC-deficient cells. These results give the necessary background to evaluate the therapeutic effect in twitcher of brain grafting of neural progenitor cells engineered to release high levels of GALC.

Galactocerebrosidase (GALC, EC 3.2.1.46) was purified from human urine by a series of hydrophobic affinity column chromatography steps. The activity was enriched 176,000-fold from concentrated urine by only four columns, including octyl Sepharose, hydroxylapatite, butyl Sepharose and ethyl-agarose. The overall recovery was about 20% but only low amounts were obtained due to its low abundance. The estimated final specific activities of several batches were between 1 and 2 mmol/h per mg protein. The final purified fractions were essentially free of other lysosomal enzyme activities. The most pure fractions showed a series of bands between 50 and 53 kDa on sodium dodecylsulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis which were determined to have identical N-terminal amino acid sequence. In addition, gel filtration of partially purified GALC after disassociation showed one peak of activity estimated to have a molecular mass near 50 kDa. GALC was also purified from human brain and human placenta using the same methods demonstrating the usefulness of this procedure in obtaining GALC from solid human tissues. In addition to the bands migrating near 50 kDa from urine, there were also bands at 80 kDa and 30 kDa in some preparations. By N-terminal sequencing and the use of antipeptide antibodies, the 80 kDa band was demonstrated to have the same N-terminal amino acids as the 50-53 kDa bands. The 30 kDa band had a unique sequence. The relationship between the different molecular weight species remains to be determined. The purification of GALC and the securing of amino acid sequence information will aid in the cloning of the GALC gene. This enzyme is deficient in human patients with Krabbe disease and several animal species.

This chapter describes in detail a practical procedure for the preparation of radiolabeled galactocerebroside and its use in the assay of galactocerebrosidase (GalCase), the enzyme deficient in globoid cell leukodystrophy (Krabbe disease). The reference range for leukocytes and fibroblasts is 0.9-4.4 and 8-36 nmoles substrate hydrolyzed per hour per milligram of protein, respectively. Because of its low abundance this enzyme is difficult to assay in certain situations, such as prenatal diagnosis by chorionic villus sampling. To obviate this a modified assay is used where only the radiolabeled substrate is included in the incubation. This provides a clear separation between affected samples and unaffected controls. The methods detailed here should be reproducible in any laboratory.
