What is the mode of inheritance of short QT syndrome?

[PMID: 19829181]
The past 2 decades have witnessed the emergence of many disease states related to ion-channel disorders, the so-called "channelopathies," usually associated with structurally normal hearts. The initial emphasis was directed toward the congenital long QT syndrome and the Brugada syndrome. Recently, the hereditary short QT syndrome has emerged as yet another rare channelopathy. This autosomal dominant syndrome can afflict infants, children, or young adults; often a remarkable family background of sudden cardiac death is elucidated. The electrocardiogram is characterized by a strikingly short QT interval (typically <320 milliseconds); virtual absence of the ST segment; and tall, peaked, narrow-based T waves. There is a marked propensity for paroxysmal atrial fibrillation, and increased risk for sudden cardiac death from ventricular tachyarrhythmias. At electrophysiology study, short atrial and ventricular refractory periods are found, with easily inducible atrial fibrillation and polymorphic ventricular tachycardia with programmed electrical stimulation. Gain-of-function mutations in 3 genes encoding potassium channels have been identified, which explain the abbreviated repolarization seen in this condition. The suggested treatment is an implantable cardioverter-defibrillator, though the possibilities of inappropriate shocks have caused some concern, especially in younger patients. The ability of quinidine and disopyramide to prolong the QT interval has the potential to be effective pharmacological therapy for patients with short QT syndrome, but awaits additional confirmatory clinical data.

Sudden cardiac death in individuals with structurally normal hearts accounts for approximately 20% of sudden cardiac death cases. Patients in this subgroup suffer from what has been named "electrical diseases" which are gradually coming into focus as inherited ion channelopathies, diseases of anchoring proteins or of intracellular calcium regulating proteins. From 1993, the Short QT Syndrome (SQTS) came to our attention, as a new inherited "electrical disease" associated with increased risk of sudden cardiac death and atrial fibrillation. Mutations of Ikr, Iks, Ikl channels cause dysfunctional Iks, Ikr, Ikl channels with an increase in the net outward K current leading to shortening of repolarization. This in turn leads to a shorter QT interval on the ECG and shorter atrial and ventricular refractory periods with increased susceptibility to VF and AF. There seems to be an autosomal dominant mode of inheritance. The clinical profile of SQTS consists of: family history of sudden cardiac death, personal history of palpitations, syncope, dizziness, resuscitated SCD, history of AF and documented VF. It is important to emphasize that SQTS is symptomatic from early age (new-born) to old age. Therefore, it is possible that SQTS accounts for some of the sudden infant death syndrome cases and for some cases of AF, especially lone AF. The only efficient treatment for ventricular arrhythmias is ICD, associated with drugs (Quinidine or Propaphenone) for AF prophylaxis and for reducing the number of ventricular arrhythmic events (and ICD discharges).

Conduction disorders result in cardiac arrhythmias that may be fatal. Histiocytoid cardiomyopathy, Arrhythmogenic right ventricular dysplasia, Isolated noncompaction of the left ventricle, Long QT syndrome (LQTS) and Brugada syndrome, are all well described. Congenital short QT syndrome is a new familial primary electrical disease of the heart, which is characterized by abnormally short QT interval and paroxysmal atrial and ventricular tachyarrhythmias, including sudden cardiac death. An autosomal dominant mode of inheritance has been suggested. Catecholaminergic polymorphic ventricular tachycardia is an inherited disease and occurs in the absence of structural heart disease or known associated syndromes. Although the histological appearance of some of these disorders may be diagnostic, molecular analysis is necessary to define clearly the particular type of cardiomyopathy.
