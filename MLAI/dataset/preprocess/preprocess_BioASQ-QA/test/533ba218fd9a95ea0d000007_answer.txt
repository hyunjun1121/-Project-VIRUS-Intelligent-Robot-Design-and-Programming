IDEAL_ANSWER:
- T1 mapping can quantitatively characterize myocardial tissue, in particular diffuse and interstitial fibrosis, edema in both overt and subclinical cardiophyopathies. However more research is required before a large-scale application for clinical decision-making can be recommended.
- The clinical indication of cardiac T1 mapping magnetic resonance is the detection  of diffuse myocardial fibrosis in nonischemic cardiomyopathies

EXACT_ANSWER:
- detection  of myocardial fibrosis in nonischemic cardiomyopathies
- T1 mapping can quantitatively characterize myocardial tissue, i.e. fibrosis and edema.
