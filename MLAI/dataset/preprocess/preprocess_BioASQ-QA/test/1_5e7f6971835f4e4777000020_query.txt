Which disease is ZP-PTH used for?

[PMID: 20567999]
To evaluate the clinical PK/PD of PTH(1-34) delivered by a novel transdermal drug-coated microneedle patch system (ZP-PTH) for the treatment of osteoporosis. Phase 1 PK studies evaluated the effect of site of administration, patch wear time and dose in normal volunteers, ages 40-85 yrs. Phase 2 was conducted in post-menopausal women with osteoporosis to determine the patch dose response compared to placebo patch and FORTEO® injection. Phase 1 ZP-PTH patch delivery demonstrated a rapid PTH plasma pulse profile with T(max) 3 times shorter and apparent T(1/2) 2 times shorter than FORTEO®. In Phase 2, ZP-PTH 20, 30 and 40 µg doses showed a proportional increase in plasma PTH AUC. Inter-subject and intra-subject AUC variability was similar for all patch doses and comparable to injection. All patch doses produced a significant increase in spine bone mineral density. Unexpectedly, ZP-PTH also produced an early increase in hip bone mineral density, an effect not observed with the injection. These studies suggest that this novel ZP-PTH patch system can deliver a consistent and therapeutically relevant PTH PK profile. Based on encouraging Phase 2 safety and efficacy data, the program is advancing into a pivotal Phase 3 clinical study.
