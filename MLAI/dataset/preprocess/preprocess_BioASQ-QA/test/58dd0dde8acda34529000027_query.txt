What tissue is commonly affected in Marfan's syndrome

[PMID: 23304566]
Marfan syndrome is an autosomal dominant systemic disorder of the connective tissue. Children affected by the Marfan syndrome carry a mutation in one of their two copies of the gene that encodes the connective tissue protein fibrillin-1. Marfan syndrome affects most organs and tissues, especially the skeleton, lungs, eyes, heart, and the large blood vessel that distributes blood from the heart to the rest of the body. A case report of Marfan syndrome has been reported with oral features. The dental problems of the child were treated under general anesthesia and a one-month review showed intact stainless steel crowns' restorations and no signs of secondary caries.

Marfan syndrome (MFS) is an autosomal dominant disorder of connective tissue, caused by mutations of the microfibrillar protein fibrillin-1, that predisposes affected individuals to aortic aneurysm and rupture and is associated with increased TGFβ signaling. TGFβ is secreted from cells as a latent complex consisting of TGFβ, the TGFβ propeptide, and a molecule of latent TGFβ binding protein (LTBP). Improper extracellular localization of the latent complex can alter active TGFβ levels, and has been hypothesized as an explanation for enhanced TGFβ signaling observed in MFS. We previously reported the absence of LTBP-3 in matrices lacking fibrillin-1, suggesting that perturbed TGFβ signaling in MFS might be due to defective interaction of latent TGFβ complexes containing LTBP-3 with mutant fibrillin-1 microfibrils. To test this hypothesis, we genetically suppressed Ltbp3 expression in a mouse model of progressively severe MFS. Here, we present evidence that MFS mice lacking LTBP-3 have improved survival, essentially no aneurysms, reduced disruption and fragmentation of medial elastic fibers, and decreased Smad2/3 and Erk1/2 activation in their aortas. These data suggest that, in MFS, improper localization of latent TGFβ complexes composed of LTBP-3 and TGFβ contributes to aortic disease progression.

Marfan syndrome is an autosomal dominant connective tissue disorder commonly due to mutation of the fibrillin-1 (FBN-1) gene that causes disruption of elastic fibers in large- and medium-size arteries and predisposes to aneurysm formation and arterial dissection. Cardiovascular complications occur in most patients with Marfan syndrome, but interestingly, neurovascular complications of Marfan syndrome are rare. We present a novel case of an adolescent with Marfan syndrome with spontaneous intracranial cerebral artery dissection and ischemic stroke with hemorrhagic transformation. This case is novel in that it reports spontaneous intracranial dissection in a young patient with Marfan syndrome and highlights the rare intrinsic neurovascular complications that can occur in these patients.

Marfan's syndrome is an autosomal dominant condition with an estimated prevalence of one in 10,000 to 20,000 individuals. This rare hereditary connective tissue disorder affects many parts of the body. The diagnosis of Marfan's syndrome is established in accordance with a review of the diagnostic criteria, known as the Ghent nosology, through a comprehensive assessment largely based on a combination of major and minor clinical manifestations in various organ systems and the family history. Aortic root dilation and mitral valve prolapse are the main presentations among the cardiovascular malformations of Marfan's syndrome. The pathogenesis of Marfan's syndrome has not been fully elucidated. However, fibrillin-1 gene mutations are believed to exert a dominant negative effect. Therefore, Marfan's syndrome is termed a fibrillinopathy, along with other connective tissue disorders with subtle differences in clinical manifestations. The treatment may include prophylactic β-blockers and angiotensin II-receptor blockers in order to slow down the dilation of the ascending aorta, and prophylactic aortic surgery. Importantly, β-blocker therapy may reduce TGF-β activation, which has been recognized as a contributory factor in Marfan's syndrome. The present article aims to provide an overview of this rare hereditary disorder.

Fibrillins are the major components of microfibrils in the extracellular matrix of elastic and non-elastic tissues. They are multi-domain proteins, containing primarily calcium binding epidermal growth factor-like (cbEGF) domains and 8-cysteine/transforming growth factor-beta binding protein-like (TB) domains. Mutations in the fibrillin-1 gene give rise to Marfan syndrome, a connective tissue disorder with clinical complications in the cardiovascular, skeletal, ocular and other organ systems. Here, we review the consequences of engineered Marfan syndrome mutations in fibrillin-1 at the protein, cellular and organismal levels. Representative point mutations associated with Marfan syndrome in affected individuals have been introduced and analyzed in recombinant fibrillin-1 fragments. Those mutations affect fibrillin-1 on a structural and functional level. Mutations which impair folding of cbEGF domains can affect protein trafficking. Protein folding disrupted by some mutations can lead to defective secretion in mutant fibrillin-1 fragments, whereas fragments with other Marfan mutations are secreted normally. Many Marfan mutations render fibrillin-1 more susceptible to proteolysis. There is also evidence that some mutations affect heparin binding. Few mutations have been further analyzed in mouse models. An extensively studied mouse model of Marfan syndrome expresses mouse fibrillin-1 with a missense mutation (p.C1039G). The mice display similar characteristics to human patients with Marfan syndrome. Overall, the analyses of engineered mutations leading to Marfan syndrome provide important insights into the pathogenic molecular mechanisms exerted by mutated fibrillin-1.

Marfan syndrome (MS) is a connective tissue disorder that affects thousands of adolescents [Population Reference Bureau, 2013]. Some adolescent patients with MS may use social media to express their experiences and emotions, but little is known about what patients choose to share online. To investigate social media content related to Marfan syndrome we used search terms "Marfan syndrome" and "Marfans" on six different social media sites. The top five recent and popular posts for each site were collected and coded weekly for five weeks. Posts were excluded if they were reshared content or not in English. A codebook was developed using an iterative process to categorize posts and comments. Out of 300 posts collected 147 posts (49.0%) were included for evaluation. Categories of displayed content included personal pictures, memes and pictures featuring symptoms of MS (41.5%) and personal MS experiences (27.1% of posts). One quarter of the posts specifically mentioned a positive experience or how thankful the profile owner was for their life. A unique category of posts (13.7%) referenced Austin Carlile, a celebrity singer with MS, as a role model. Physicians and healthcare providers may consider using social media to understand common MS concerns and to place future health education materials.

Marfans syndrome is an Autosomal dominant disorder of the connective tissues resulting in abnormalities of the musculoskeletal system, cardiovascular system and eyes. It has a prevalence of 1 in 100,000 population1 and occurs in all ethnic groups. It may be familial or due to new mutation (30%), in the fibrillin gene on arm of chromosome 15. It is estimated that one person in every 3000-5000 has Marfans syndrome may have cardiovascular abnormalities and may be complicated by infective endocartditis. About 90% of Marfan patients will develop cardiac complications2. The patient under discussion has musculoskeletal (Tall stature, reduced upper-lower segment ratio, arm-span to height ratio > 1.05, high arched palate) and Cardiovascular features (Severe aortic regurgitation complicated with infective endocarditis).

A patient with the Marfan syndrome died suddenly from aortic rupture and dissection in the early puerperium of her second pregnancy. Although the association of the Marfan syndrome and pregnancy is extremely rare, the case reported here being only the fifth on record, the concurrence of dissecting aneurysm or aortic dissection with pregnancy is more frequent. Furthermore it is accepted that aortic dissection in young women below the age of 40 is more common in the pregnant than those not pregnant. The cause of the enhancing effect of pregnancy is unknown but is thought to be endocrine since the stability of connective tissue can be influenced by hormones, particularly the sex steroids. An unusual feature of the present case is the florid inflammatory reaction in the adventitia of the aorta, not specifically related to pregnancy or to the Marfan syndrome, and it is assumed that in this patient the congenital defect of connective tissue assumed to be the basis of the Marfan syndrome is associated with an acute collagen change or necrosis, possibly illustrating a link between the heritable disorders of connective tissue and the diffuse collagen disease.

Fibrillin is the major component of extracellular microfibrils and is widely distributed in connective tissue throughout the body. Mutations in the fibrillin-1 (FBN1) gene, on chromosome 15q21.1, have been found to cause Marfan syndrome, a dominantly inherited disorder characterised by clinically variable skeletal, ocular, and cardiovascular abnormalities. Fibrillin-1 mutations have also been found in several other related connective tissue disorders, such as severe neonatal Marfan syndrome, dominant ectopia lentis, familial ascending aortic aneurysm, isolated skeletal features of Marfan syndrome, and Shprintzen-Goldberg syndrome. Mutations are spread throughout the gene and, with the exception of neonatal Marfan syndrome, show no obvious clustering or phenotypic association.

The Marfan syndrome is an inherited disorder of the connective tissue which is mainly caused by a mutation in the fibrillin-1 gene. The defect in the connective tissue protein can lead to several organ dysfunctions. For the life expectancy, the cardiovascular aspect is of paramount importance. Patients with Marfan syndrome may develop aortic aneurysms and valvular heart defects. The risk of aortic aneurysms consists in the development of aortic dissection or rupture with their fatal consequences. Besides the cardiovascular manifestation, the skeletal and ocular system can also be affected. The skeletal manifestation is often characterised by long limbs, arachnodactyly, and abnormal joint flexibility along with other signs. Patients may also have dislocated lenses, ectasia of the dural sac, stretch marks, spontaneous pneumothorax, recurrent hernia, or a family history suspicious for Marfan. During the past years, other related connective tissue disorders with analogous organ manifestation have been described (e.g., Loeys-Dietz syndrome). In this article we present the basic knowledge about these connective tissue disorders, and we mention new insights in the recently explored pathophysiology of the disorder which is a possible target for future medical treatment options. Furthermore, recent new concepts for the prophylactic treatment of the aortic manifestation are explained.

A few years ago no one would have suspected that the well-known disorder of connective tissue, Marfan syndrome, could be caused by mutations in a recently discovered extracellular component, fibrillin. Likewise, nobody would have predicted that fibrillin represents a small family of proteins that are associated with several phenotypically overlapping disorders. The fibrillins are integral constituents of the non-collagenous microfibrils, with an average diameter of 10 nm. These aggregates are distributed in the extracellular matrix of virtually every tissue. Microfibrillar bundles provide the external coating to elastin in elastic fibers, and serve an anchoring function in non-elastic tissues. At higher resolution, individual microfibrils have a "beads-on-a-string" appearance resulting from the head-to-tail polymerization of multiple fibrillin aggregates. Structurally, fibrillin contains a series of repeated sequences homologous to the epidermal growth factor calcium-binding motif. Characterization of fibrillin mutations in Marfan syndrome patients, together with the elucidation of the structure of the fibrillin proteins, have provided new insights, and raised new questions, about the function of the 10 nm microfibrils. For example, it is possible that the fibrillins, in addition to serving a structural function, might also be involved in regulating cellular activities and morphogenetic programs. It is fitting that the long search for the Marfan syndrome gene has brought a novel group of proteins to the forefront of extracellular matrix biology.

Marfan syndrome (MFS) is a systemic disorder of the connective tissue with pleiotropic manifestations due to heterozygous FBN1 mutations and consequent upregulation of TGFβ signaling in affected tissues. Myxomatous thickening and elongation of the mitral valve (MV) leaflets commonly occur in this condition. Investigation of murine models of this disease has led to improved understanding of the mechanisms that underlie many of the phenotypic features of MFS, including MV disease. Loeys-Dietz syndrome (LDS) is a related disorder due to heterozygous mutations in the genes encoding subunits of the TGFβ receptor, and it may also involve the MV leaflets with similar elongation and thickening of the MV leaflets. Although the genetic basis and pathogenesis of nonsyndromic MV prolapse has been elusive to date, insights derived from monogenic disorders like MFS and LDS can be informative with regard to novel gene discovery and investigation into the pathogenesis of MV disease. This manuscript will review the prevalence of MV disease in MFS, its pathogenic basis as determined in mice with Fbn1 mutations, and ongoing studies that seek to better understand MV disease in the context of fibrillin-1 deficiency or excessive TGFβ signaling.

Marfan's syndrome is an inherited disorder of connective tissue associated with characteristic abnormalities of the skeletal, ocular, and cardiovascular systems. Marked clinical variability and age dependency of all manifestations of Marfan's syndrome may render the unequivocal diagnosis difficult in mildly affected, young subjects. The study and care of a 32-year-old woman with evidence of Marfan's syndrome, several cardiac abnormalities, and paranoid schizophrenia led to an investigation of her consenting relatives to verify the penetrance of Marfan's syndrome and the degree of comorbidity between the disease and psychiatric disorders. The patient and 12 subjects belonging to three generations of her family underwent cardiovascular, skeletal, ophthalmologic, and psychiatric examinations. Two-dimensional and Doppler echocardiography were performed. One female index patient and six of her first-degree relatives were found to be affected by Marfan's syndrome. All seven patients were found to have mitral valve prolapse associated with other cardiac abnormalities. Four of these patients were affected by the following psychiatric disorders: generalized anxiety disorder, major depressive disorder, paranoid schizophrenia (two cases). Six more relatives without Marfan's syndrome showed mitral valve prolapse in association with other echocardiographic features. Two of these were found to be affected by a major depressive disorder. The present data support the hypothesis that a psychiatric condition, associated with a significantly high frequency of cardiac involvement, may be part of the phenotype of Marfan's syndrome.

Marfan's syndrome is a heritable connective tissue disorder that has been associated with intracranial aneurysms. However, the prevalence of intracranial aneurysms in Marfan's syndrome is unknown and pathological studies of affected vessels have not been reported. We therefore examined the neuropathological findings in a group of patients with Marfan's syndrome. We identified all patients with Marfan's syndrome in whom postmortem examination had been performed at the Mayo Clinic between 1969 and 1993. Autopsy included examination of the brain in seven patients with Marfan's syndrome (five men and two women with a mean age of 28 yr). Each of two patients had one or more intracranial aneurysms. The first patient, a 32-year-old man who died as a result of aortic dissection, was observed to have an incidental saccular supraclinoid carotid artery aneurysm (7 mm). Microscopic examination of the remainder of the cerebral arteries revealed duplication and fragmentation of the internal elastic lamina. The second patient, a 20-year-old man who died as a result of a subarachnoid hemorrhage, had ruptured saccular supraclinoid carotid artery (3 mm) and anterior cerebral artery (20 mm) aneurysms as well as unruptured fusiform middle cerebral artery (18 mm) and posterior cerebral artery (13 mm) aneurysms. Microscopic examination of the cerebral arteries revealed widespread changes consisting of intimal proliferation, medial degeneration, and fragmentation of the internal elastic lamina. These findings confirm an association between Marfan's syndrome and intracranial aneurysms. Microscopic involvement of cerebral arteries in Marfan's syndrome may be variable, even among those with intracranial aneurysms.

Marfan syndrome is an inherited multisystemic connective-tissue disease that is caused by a mutation of the fibrillin-1 gene. The syndrome is characterized by a wide range of clinical manifestations. Common cardiovascular manifestations, most of which are substantial contributors to mortality, include annuloaortic ectasia with or without aortic valve insufficiency, aortic dissection, aortic aneurysm, pulmonary artery dilatation, and mitral valve prolapse. Scoliosis, pectus excavatum and carinatum, arachnodactyly, and acetabular protrusion are common musculoskeletal manifestations. Dural ectasia is a characteristic central nervous system manifestation. In some patients with Marfan syndrome, there is also pulmonary and ocular involvement. Early identification and treatment of these conditions contribute to an improved quality of life and a life expectancy close to the average for the general population in the United States. Radiologists play a key role in the diagnosis of Marfan syndrome. Knowledge about the various manifestations of Marfan syndrome and awareness of their radiologic appearances permit a comprehensive diagnostic approach that allows better patient care.

Marfan's syndrome is an autosomal dominant disorder of connective tissue, commonly involving the cardiovascular, ocular, and skeletal systems. Revised criteria for the clinical diagnosis of Marfan's syndrome regard skeletal involvement as a major criterion if at least four of eight typical skeletal manifestations are present, one of which is protrusio acetabuli. Using Kulman's method to determine the presence of protrusio, we analysed the pelvic X-rays of 15 patients with Marfan's syndrome and 15 controls. Protrusio was present in 47% (7/15) of Marfan patients, compared with 7% (1/15) of controls (P = 0.035). Using the revised criteria, the presence of protrusio would have affected the final diagnosis of Marfan's syndrome in only one patient out of 15. Therefore, we recommend that a pelvic X-ray is reserved for those cases in which the presence of protrusio will alter the final diagnosis. With regard to the radiological assessment of protrusio, in our opinion this can be performed simply and reliably using the position of the acetabular line alone.
