The sodium-calcium exchanger (NCX) is one of the transporters contributing to the control of intracellular calcium (Ca(2+)) concentration by normally mediating net Ca(2+) efflux. However, the reverse mode of the NCX can cause intracellular Ca(2+) concentration overload, which exacerbates the myocardial tissue injury resulting from ischemia. Although the NCX inhibitor SEA0400 has been shown to therapeutically reduce myocardial injury, no in vivo technique exists to monitor intracellular Ca(2+) fluctuations produced by this drug. Cardiac manganese-enhanced MRI (MEMRI) may indirectly assess Ca(2+) efflux by estimating changes in manganese (Mn(2+)) content in vivo, since Mn(2+) has been suggested as a surrogate marker for Ca(2+). This study used the MEMRI technique to examine the temporal features of cardiac Mn(2+) efflux by implementing a T(1)-mapping method and inhibiting the NCX with SEA0400. The change in (1)H(2)O longitudinal relaxation rate, Delta R(1), in the left ventricular free wall, was calculated at different time points following infusion of 190 nmol/g manganese chloride (MnCl(2)) in healthy adult male mice. The results showed 50% MEMRI signal attenuation at 3.4 +/- 0.6 h post-MnCl(2) infusion without drug intervention. Furthermore, treatment with 50 +/- 0.2 mg/kg of SEA0400 significantly reduced the rate of decrease in Delta R(1). At 4.9-5.9 h post-MnCl(2) infusion, the average Delta R(1) values for the two groups treated with SEA0400 were 2.46 +/- 0.29 and 1.72 +/- 0.24 s(-1) for 50 and 20 mg/kg doses, respectively, as compared to the value of 1.27 +/- 0.28 s(-1) for the control group. When this in vivo data were compared to ex vivo absolute manganese content data, the MEMRI T(1)-mapping technique was shown to effectively quantify Mn(2+) efflux rates in the myocardium. Therefore, combining an NCX inhibitor with MEMRI may be a useful technique for assessing Mn(2+) transport mechanisms and rates in vivo, which may reflect changes in Ca(2+) transport.

Activation of the Na+/Ca2+ exchanger may contribute to Ca2+ overload during reperfusion after transient ischemia. We examined the effects of 2-[4-[(2,5-difluorophenyl) methoxy]phenoxy]-5-ethoxyaniline (SEA0400), a selective inhibitor of Na+/Ca2+ exchange, on a canine model of ischemia/reperfusion injury (myocardial stunning). Myocardial stunning was induced by a 15-min occlusion of the left anterior descending coronary artery followed by a 4-h reperfusion in anesthetized open-chest dogs. Reperfusion gradually restored myocardial percent segment shortening but remained depressed during a 4-h reperfusion period. A bolus intravenous injection of SEA0400 (0.3 or 1.0 mg/kg), given 1 min before reperfusion, improved significantly the recovery of percent segment shortening in the ischemic/reperfused myocardium. SEA0400 did not affect the hemodynamics and electrocardiogram parameters. In addition, SEA0400 did not affect reperfusion-induced change in coronary blood flow. These results suggest that the Na+/Ca2+ exchanger is involved in the stunned myocardium of dogs after reperfusion, and that SEA0400 has a protective effect against myocardial stunning in dogs.

Molecular remodeling in heart failure includes slowing of repolarization, leading to proarrhythmia. To evaluate the effects of Na(+)/Ca(2+) exchanger (NCX) inhibition on repolarization as a novel antiarrhythmic concept in chronic heart failure (CHF). CHF was induced by rapid ventricular pacing in rabbits. Left ventricular function was assessed by echocardiography. Monophasic action potentials (MAPs) showed a prolongation of repolarization in CHF after atrioventricular block and stimulation at different cycle lengths. Sotalol (100 μM, n = 13) or veratridine (0.5 μM; n = 15) resulted in a further significant increase in the MAP duration. CHF was associated with an increased dispersion of repolarization, as compared with sotalol-treated (+22 ± 7 ms; P < .05) and veratridine-treated (+20 ± 6 ms; P < .05) sham hearts. In the presence of a low potassium concentration, sotalol and veratridine reproducibly induced early afterdepolarizations (EADs) and polymorphic ventricular tachyarrhythmias (VTs). SEA0400 (1 μM), a pharmacological inhibitor of NCX, significantly shortened the MAP duration (P < .01) and reduced dispersion (P < .05). It suppressed EAD in 6 of 13 sotalol-treated failing hearts and in 9 of 10 veratridine-treated failing hearts, leading to a reduction in VT (60% in sotalol-treated failing hearts and 83% in veratridine-treated failing hearts). Simulations using a mathematical model showed a reduction in the action potential duration and the number of EADs by the NCX block in all subgroups. In an experimental model of CHF, the acute inhibition of NCX (1) reduces the MAP duration, (2) decreases dispersion of repolarization, and (3) suppresses EAD and VT. Our observations indicate for the first time that pharmacological NCX inhibition increases repolarization reserve and protects against VTs in heart failure.

We investigated the expression of Na(+)/Ca(2+) exchanger (NCX) and the functional role of NCX in retinal damage by using NCX1-heterozygous deficient mice (NCX1(+/-)) and SEA0400 (2-[4-[(2,5-difluorophenyl)methoxy] phenoxy]-5-ethoxyaniline), a selective NCX inhibitor in vivo. We also examined the role of NCX in oxygen-glucose deprivation (OGD) stress with a retinal ganglion cell line (RGC-5) cell culture in vitro. The expression of NCX1 was confirmed and entirely localized in retina by immunoblotting and immunohistochemistry, respectively. NCX1(+/-) mice possessed significant protection against retinal damage induced by intravitreal injection of N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA). SEA0400 at 3 and 10 mg/kg significantly reduced NMDA- or high intraocular pressure-induced retinal cell damage in mice. Furthermore, SEA0400 reduced the number of TUNEL (terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase dUTP nick-end labeling)-positive cells and the expression of phosphorylated mitogen-activated protein kinases (ERK1/2, JNK, p38) induced by NMDA injection. In RGC-5, SEA0400 at 0.3 and 1 microM significantly inhibited OGD-induced cell damage. OGD-induced cell damage was aggravated by ouabain (a Na(+),K(+)-ATPase inhibitor) at 100 microM, and this increased damage was significantly reduced by SEA0400 at 1 microM. In conclusion, these results suggest that NCX1 may play a role in retinal cell death induced by NMDA and ischemia-reperfusion.

1. Using SEA0400, a potent and selective inhibitor of the Na+-Ca2+ exchanger (NCX), we examined whether NCX is involved in nitric oxide (NO)-induced disturbance of endoplasmic reticulum (ER) Ca2+ homeostasis followed by apoptosis in cultured rat microglia. 2. Sodium nitroprusside (SNP), an NO donor, decreased cell viability in a dose- and time-dependent manner with apoptotic cell death in cultured microglia. 3. Treatment with SNP decreased the ER Ca2+ levels as evaluated by measuring the increase in cytosolic Ca2+ level induced by exposing cells to thapsigargin, an irreversible inhibitor of ER Ca2+-ATPase. 4. The treatment with SNP also increased mRNA expression of CHOP and GPR78, makers of ER stress. 5. SEA0400 at 0.3-1.0 microM protected microglia against SNP-induced apoptosis. 6. SEA0400 blocked not only the SNP-induced decrease in ER Ca2+ levels but also SNP-induced increase in CHOP and GRP78 mRNAs. 7. SEA0400 did not affect capacitative Ca2+ entry in the presence and absence of SNP. 8. SNP increased Na+-dependent 45Ca2+ uptake and this increase was blocked by SEA0400. 9. These results suggest that SNP induces apoptosis via the ER stress pathway and SEA0400 attenuates SNP-induced apoptosis via suppression of the ER stress in cultured microglia. Our findings imply that NCX plays a role in ER Ca2+ depletion under pathological conditions.

The Na(+)/Ca(2+)exchanger (NCX) principal function is taking 1 Ca(2+) out of the cytoplasm and introducing 3 Na(+). The increase of cytoplasmic Na(+) concentration induces the NCX reverse mode (NCX(REV)), favoring Ca(2+) influx. NCX(REV) can be inhibited by: KB-R7943 a non-specific compound that blocks voltage-dependent and store-operated Ca(2+) channels; SEA0400 that appears to be selective for NCX(REV), but difficult to obtain and SN-6, which efficacy has been shown only in cardiomyocytes. We found that PPADS, a P2X receptor antagonist, acts as a NCX(REV) inhibitor in guinea pig tracheal myocytes. In these cells, we characterized the NCX(REV) by substituting NaCl and NaHCO(3) with LiCl, resulting in the increase of the intracellular Ca(2+) concentration ([Ca(2+)]i) using fura 2-AM. We analyzed 5 consecutive responses of the NCX(REV) every 10 min, finding no differences among them. To evaluate the effect of different NCX(REV) blockers, concentration response curves to KB-R7943 (1, 3.2 and 10 μM), and SN-6 (3.2, 10 and 30 μM) were constructed, whereas PPADS effect was characterized as time- and concentration-dependent (1, 3.2, 10 and 30 μM). PPADS had similar potency and efficacy as KB-R7943, whereas SN-6 was the least effective. Furthermore, KCl-induced contraction, sensitive to D600 and nifedipine, was blocked by KB-R7943, but not by PPADS. KCl-induced [Ca(2+)]i increment in myocytes was also significantly decreased by KBR-7943 (10 μM). Our results demonstrate that PPADS can be used as a reliable pharmacological tool to inhibit NCX(REV), with the advantage that it is more specific than KB-R7943 because it does not affect L-type Ca(2+) channels.

The Na(+)/Ca(2+) exchanger (NCX) plays a role in the regulation of intracellular Ca(2+) levels, and nitric oxide (NO) is involved in many pathological conditions including neurodegenerative disorders. We have previously found that sodium nitroprusside (SNP), an NO donor, causes apoptotic-like cell death in cultured glial cells via NCX-mediated pathways and the mechanism for NO-induced cytotoxicity is cell type-dependent. The present study examined using the specific NCX inhibitor 2-[4-[(2,5-difluorophenyl)methoxy]phenoxy]-5-ethoxyaniline (SEA0400) whether NCX is involved in NO-induced injury in cultured neuronal cells. The treatment of neuroblastoma SH-SY5Y cells with SNP resulted in apoptosis and the cytotoxicity was blocked by the mitogen-activated protein (MAP)/extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) kinase inhibitor U0126 and the p38 MAP kinase (MAPK) inhibitor SB203580, but not by the c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) inhibitor SP60012. SNP increased Ca(2+) influx and intracellular Ca(2+) levels. In addition, SNP increased ERK and p38 MAPK phosphorylation, and production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) in an extracellular Ca(2+)-dependent manner. These effects of SNP were prevented by SEA0400. SNP-induced cytotoxicity was not affected by inhibitors of the Ca(2+), Na(+) and store-operated/capacitative channels. Moreover, SNP-induced increase in intracellular Ca(2+) levels, ROS production and decrease in cell viability were blocked by a cGMP-dependent protein kinase (PKG) inhibitor. These results suggest that Ca(2+) influx via the reverse of NCX is involved in the cascade of NO-induced neuronal apoptosis and NO activates the NCX through guanylate cyclase/PKG pathway.

The effects of a new, potent, and selective inhibitor of the Na(+)/Ca(2+) exchange, SEA-0400 (SEA), on steady-state outward (forward exchange), inward (reverse exchange), and Ca(2+)/Ca(2+) transport exchange modes were studied in internally dialyzed squid giant axons from both the extra- and intracellular sides. Inhibition by SEA takes place preferentially from the intracellular side of the membrane. Its inhibition has the following characteristics: it increases synergic intracellular Na(+) (Na(i)(+)) + intracellular H(+) (H(i)(+)) inactivation, is antagonized by ATP and intracellular alkalinization, and is enhanced by intracellular acidification even in the absence of Na(+). Inhibition by SEA is still present even after 1 h of its removal from the experimental solutions, whereas removal of the cointeracting agents of inhibition, Na(i)(+) and H(i)(+), even in the continuous presence of SEA, releases inhibition, indicating that SEA facilitates the reversible attachment of the natural H(i)(+) and Na(i)(+) synergic inhibitors. On the basis of a recent model of squid Na(+)/Ca(2+) exchange regulation (DiPolo R and Beauge L. J Physiol 539: 791-803, 2002), we suggest that SEA acts on the H(i)(+) + Na(i)(+) inactivation process and can interact with the Na(+)-free and Na(+)-bound protonized carrier. Protection by ATP concurs with the antagonism of the nucleotide by H(i)(+) + Na(i)(+) synergic inhibition.

Involvement of the Na+/Ca2+ exchanger in ouabain-induced inotropy and arrhythmogenesis was examined with a specific inhibitor, SEA0400. In right ventricular papillary muscle isolated from guinea-pig ventricle, 1 microM SEA0400, which specifically inhibits the Na+/Ca2+ exchanger by 80%, reduced the ouabain (1 microM)-induced positive inotropy by 40%, but had no effect on the inotropy induced by 100 microM isobutyl methylxantine. SEA0400 significantly inhibited the contracture induced by low Na+ solution. In HEK293 cells expressing the Na+/Ca2+ exchanger, 1 microM ouabain induced an increase in intracellular Ca2+, which was inhibited by SEA0400. The arrhythmic contractions induced by 3 microM ouabain were significantly reduced by SEA0400. These results provide pharmacological evidence that the Na+/Ca2+ exchanger is involved in ouabain-induced inotropy and arrhythmogenesis.

The cardioprotective effects of SEA0400, a novel Na(+)-Ca(2+) exchanger inhibitor, were examined in isolated guinea pig myocardial tissue and ventricular myocytes. In a coronary-perfused right ventricular tissue preparation, SEA0400 had no cardiosuppressive effect during normoxia and experimental ischemia, but enhanced the recovery of contractile force during reperfusion. SEA0400 had no effect on tissue ATP content during normoxia, but attenuated its decrease during ischemia. Treatment of ventricular myocytes with an ischemia mimetic solution (high K(+), glucose free, pH 6.0, gassed with N(2)) resulted in the depolarization of the mitochondrial membrane potential and an increase in cytoplasmic and mitochondrial Ca(2+) concentration, which had a similar time course. SEA0400 significantly delayed these changes. These results suggest that SEA0400 maintains mitochondrial function and tissue ATP content during ischemia through the inhibition of cytoplasmic and mitochondrial Ca(2+) overload.

The effect of SEA0400, a novel Na+-Ca2+ exchanger inhibitor, on mechanical and electrophysiological parameters of coronary-perfused guinea-pig right ventricular tissue preparation was examined during no-flow ischemia and reperfusion. Contractile force and action potential duration were decreased during no-flow ischemia, while the resting tension was increased. Upon reperfusion, transient arrhythmias were observed and contractile force returned to less than 50% of preischemic values. SEA0400 (1 microM) had no effect on the decline in contractile force during the no-flow ischemia, but abolished the rise in resting tension. SEA0400 significantly improved the recovery of contractile force after reperfusion to about 80% of the preischemic value. SEA0400 had no effect on the action potential under normal conditions and during ischemia, but significantly improved the recovery of action potential duration after reperfusion. Enhancement of the recovery of contractile force during reperfusion by SEA0400 was also observed when the drug was applied only before and during the ischemic period and when the drug was applied only during reperfusion. The present results indicate that inhibition of Na+-Ca2+ exchanger either during ischemia or during reperfusion exerts cardioprotective effects and enhances the recovery of myocardial contractile function.

Given the potential clinical benefit of inhibiting Na+/Ca2+ exchanger (NCX) activity during myocardial ischemia reperfusion (I/R), pharmacological approaches have been pursued to both inhibit and clarify the importance of this exchanger. SEA0400 was reported to have a potent NCX selectivity. Thus, we examined the effect of SEA0400 on NCX currents and I/R induced intracellular Ca2+ overload in mouse ventricular myocytes using patch clamp techniques and fluorescence measurements. Ischemia significantly inhibited inward and outward NCX current (from -0.04+/-0.01 nA to 0 nA at -100 mV; from 0.23+/-0.08 nA to 0.11+/-0.03 nA at +50 mV, n=7), Subsequent reperfusion not only restored the current rapidly but enhanced the current amplitude obviously, especially the outward currents (from 0.23+/-0.08 nA to 0.49+/-0.12 nA at +50 mV, n=7). [Ca2+]i, expressed as the ratio of Fura-2 fluorescence intensity, increased to 138+/-7% (P<0.01) during ischemia and to 210+/-11% (P<0.01) after reperfusion. The change of NCX current and the increase of [Ca2+]i during I/R can be blocked by SEA0400 in a dose-dependent manner with an EC50 value of 31 nM and 28 nM for the inward and outward NCX current, respectively. The results suggested that SEA0400 is a potent NCX inhibitor, which can protect mouse cardiac myocytes from Ca2+ overload during I/R injuries.

The effects of 2-[4-[(2,5-difluorophenyl) methoxy]phenoxy]-5-ethoxyaniline (SEA0400), a newly synthesized Na(+)-Ca(2+) exchanger (NCX) inhibitor, on the NCX current and other membrane currents were examined in isolated guinea-pig ventricular myocytes and compared with those of 2-[2-[4-(4-nitrobenzyloxy) phenyl]ethyl]isothiourea (KB-R7943). SEA0400 concentration-dependently inhibited the NCX current with a 10 fold higher potency than that of KB-R7943; 1 microM SEA0400 and 10 microM KB-R7943 inhibited the NCX current by more than 80%. KB-R7943, at 10 microM, inhibited the sodium current, L-type calcium current, delayed rectifier potassium current and inwardly rectifying potassium current by more than 50%, but SEA0400 (1 microM) had no significant effect on these currents. These results indicate that SEA0400 is a potent and highly selective inhibitor of NCX, and would be a powerful tool for further studies on the role of NCX in the heart and the therapeutic potential of its inhibition.

We examined the involvement of the Na(+)/Ca(2+) exchanger in the automaticity of the pulmonary vein myocardium with a specific inhibitor, SEA0400. Action potentials were recorded from the myocardial layer of isolated guinea-pig pulmonary vein preparations, and Ca(2+) transients were recorded from the cardiomyocytes. Spontaneous electrical activity was observed in 17.7% of the preparations, which was inhibited by either SEA0400 or ryanodine. In quiescent preparations, ouabain induced electrical activity and spontaneous Ca(2+) transients, which were inhibited by SEA0400, as well as ryanodine. These results provide pharmacological evidence that the Na(+)/Ca(2+) exchanger underlies the automaticity of the pulmonary vein myocardium.

Nitric oxide (NO) is involved in many pathological conditions including neurodegenerative disorders. We have previously found that sodium nitroprusside (SNP), an NO donor, stimulates mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPKs) such as extracellular signal-regulating kinase (ERK), c-jun N-terminal protein kinase (JNK) and p38 MAPK, leading to caspase-independent apoptosis in cultured astrocytes. In view of the previous observation that NO stimulates the activity of the Na(+)/Ca(2+) exchanger (NCX), this study examines the involvement of NCX in cytotoxicity. The specific NCX inhibitor SEA0400 blocked SNP-induced phosphorylation of ERK, JNK and p38 MAPK, and decrease in cell viability. SNP-induced phosphorylation of ERK, JNK and p38 MAPK was blocked by removal of external Ca(2+), and SNP treatment caused an increase in (45)Ca(2+) influx. This increase in (45)Ca(2+) influx was blocked by SEA0400, but not the Ca(2+) channel blocker nifedipine. In addition, SNP-induced (45)Ca(2+) influx and cytotoxicity were reduced in NCX1-deficient cells which were transfected with NCX1 siRNA. Inhibitors of intracellular Ca(2+)-dependent proteins such as calpain and calmodulin blocked SNP-induced ERK phosphorylation and decrease in cell viability. Furthermore, the guanylate cyclase inhibitor LY83583 and the cGMP-dependent protein kinase inhibitor KT5823 blocked SNP-induced cytotoxicity. These findings suggest that NCX-mediated Ca(2+) influx triggers SNP-induced apoptosis in astrocytes, which may be mediated by a cGMP-dependent pathway.

SEA0400 is a selective inhibitor of the Na(+)/Ca(2+) exchanger having equal potencies to suppress both the forward and reverse mode operation of the Na(+)/Ca(2+) exchanger. Present experiments were designed to study the effect of partial blockade of Na(+)/Ca(2+) exchanger on Ca(2+) handling in isolated rat ventricular myocytes. Intracellular Ca(2+) transient and cell shortening were measured in ventricular myocytes loaded with Fura-2-AM fluorescent dye. Partial blockade of Na(+)/Ca(2+) exchanger was induced by superfusion of the cells with SEA0400 at a concentration of 0.3 microM. Amplitude of the intracellular Ca(2+) transient and cell shortening was significantly increased by SEA0400 in both field stimulated and voltage clamped myocytes, without significant elevation of diastolic Ca(2+) level and the decay time constant of the Ca(2+) transient. In patch clamped myocytes the SEA0400 induced increase in the Ca(2+) transient and cell shortening was accompanied by significant reduction of peak L-type Ca(2+) current. These effects can be explained by the autoregulative nature of cardiac Ca(2+) handling, as the reduced Ca(2+) efflux from the cell results in an increased Ca(2+) load to the sarcoplasmic reticulum leading to increased Ca(2+) release, which in turn may decrease the L-type Ca(2+) current by accelaration of Ca(2+) dependent inactivation of L-type Ca(2+) current. Our results suggest that complex changes in the Ca(2+) cycling can occur after selective pharmacological inhibition of the Na(+)/Ca(2+) exchanger.

The Ca2+ overload by Ca2+ influx via Na+/Ca2+ exchanger (NCX) is a critical mechanism in myocardial ischemia/reperfusion injury. We investigated protective effects of a novel selective inhibitor of NCX, SEA0400, on cardiac function and energy metabolism during ischemia and reperfusion. Langendorff-perfused rat hearts were exposed to 35 minutes global ischemia and 40 minutes reperfusion. Using 31P nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy, cardiac phosphocreatine (PCr), ATP, and pHi were monitored. SEA0400 did not change the basic cardiac function, but improved the recovery of left ventricular developed pressure (LVDP) after reperfusion (27.6 +/- 4.9 mm Hg in control, 101.2 +/- 19.3 mm Hg in 0.1 microM, and 115.5 +/- 13.3 mm Hg in 1 microM SEA0400, means +/- SE, n = 6, P < 0.05). SEA0400 reduced left ventricular end-diastolic pressure and increased coronary flow after reperfusion. SEA0400 improved the recoveries of cardiac phosphocreatine and ATP after reperfusion, but did not affect pHi. There were significant linear correlations between left ventricular developed pressure and cardiac phosphocreatine (r = 0.79, P < 0.05), and left ventricular developed pressure and ATP (r = 0.80, P < 0.05). However, SEA0400 increased the incidence and duration of reperfusion ventricular arrhythmias. SEA0400 added only after reperfusion also improved both the contractile function and energy metabolism. It is concluded that the selective inhibition of NCX may be effective to preserve high-energy phosphates and to improve cardiac function after reperfusion, but may not be able to prevent fatal arrhythmias.

SEA0400 (2-[4-[(2,5-difluorophenyl)methoxy]phenoxy]-5-ethoxyaniline) has recently been described as a potent and selective inhibitor of Na(+)-Ca(2+) exchange in cardiac, neuronal, and renal preparations. The inhibitory effects of SEA0400 were investigated on the cloned cardiac Na(+)-Ca(2+) exchanger, NCX1.1, expressed in Xenopus laevis oocytes to gain insight into its inhibitory mechanism. Na(+)-Ca(2+) exchange currents were measured using the giant excised patch technique using conditions to evaluate both inward and outward currents. SEA0400 inhibited outward Na(+)-Ca(2+) exchange currents with high affinity (IC(50) = 78 +/- 15 and 23 +/- 4 nM for peak and steady-state currents, respectively). Considerably less inhibitory potency (i.e., micromolar) was observed for inward currents. The inhibitory profile was reexamined after proteolytic treatment of excised patches with alpha-chymotrypsin, a procedure that eliminates ionic regulatory mechanisms. After this treatment, an IC(50) value of 1.2 +/- 0.6 microM was estimated for outward currents, whereas inward currents became almost insensitive to SEA0400. The inhibitory effects of SEA0400 on outward exchange currents were evident at both high and low concentrations of regulatory Ca(2+), although distinct features were noted. SEA0400 accelerated the inactivation rate of outward currents. Based on paired pulse experiments, SEA0400 altered the recovery of exchangers from the Na(+)(i)-dependent inactive state, particularly at higher regulatory Ca(2+)(i) concentrations. Finally, the inhibitory potency of SEA0400 was strongly dependent on the intracellular Na(+) concentration. Our data confirm that SEA0400 is the most potent inhibitor of the cardiac Na(+)-Ca(2+) exchanger described to date and provide a reasonable explanation for its apparent transport mode selectivity.

The plasma membrane Na(+)/Ca(2+) exchanger (NCX) is a bidirectional ion transporter that couples the translocation of Na(+) in one direction with that of Ca(2+) in the opposite direction. This system contributes to the regulation of intracellular Ca(2+) concentration via the forward mode (Ca(2+) efflux) or the reverse mode (Ca(2+) influx). We have previously demonstrated that the Ca(2+) paradox, an in vitro reperfusion model, causes the sustained activation of the reverse mode of the NCX, the disruption of Ca(2+) homeostasis, and subsequent delayed apoptotic-like death in astrocytes. In addition, we found that the nitric oxide (NO)-cyclic GMP signaling pathway inhibits Ca(2+) paradox-mediated astrocyte apoptosis, while a high concentration of NO induces cytotoxicity. In this way, Ca(2+) and NO may work together in the pathogenesis of several cells in the central nervous system. Concerning the role of NCX in NO cytotoxicity, we have found, using the specific inhibitor of NCX 2-[4-[(2,5-difluorophenyl)methoxy]phenoxy]-5-ethoxyaniline (SEA0400), that NCX is involved in NO-induced cytotoxicity in cultured microglia, astrocytes, and neuronal cells. This review summarizes the pathological roles of the NCX as a new target for NO-mediated cellular toxicity, based on our studies on NO-NCX-mediated glial toxicity.

We have recently shown that the Na(+)/Ca(2+) exchanger (NCX) is involved in nitric oxide (NO)-induced cytotoxicity in cultured astrocytes and neurons. However, there is no in vivo evidence suggesting the role of NCX in neurodegenerative disorders associated with NO. NO is implicated in the pathogenesis of neurodegenerative disorders such as Parkinson's disease. This study examined the effect of SEA0400, the specific NCX inhibitor, on 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine (MPTP)-induced dopaminergic neurotoxicity, a model of Parkinson's disease, in C57BL/6J mice. MPTP treatment (10 mg/kg, four times at 2-h intervals) decreased dopamine levels in the midbrain and impaired motor coordination, and these effects were counteracted by S-methylthiocitrulline, a selective neuronal NO synthase inhibitor. SEA0400 protected against the dopaminergic neurotoxicity (determined by dopamine levels in the midbrain and striatum, tyrosine hydroxylase immunoreactivity in the substantia nigra and striatum, striatal dopamine release, and motor deficits) in MPTP-treated mice. SEA0400 had no radical-scavenging activity. SEA0400 did not affect MPTP metabolism and MPTP-induced NO production and microglial activation, while it attenuated MPTP-induced increases in extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) phosphorylation and lipid peroxidation product, thiobarbituric acid reactive substance. These findings suggest that SEA0400 protects against MPTP-induced neurotoxicity probably by blocking ERK phosphorylation and lipid peroxidation which are downstream of NCX-mediated Ca(2+) influx.

The effects of SEA0400, a selective inhibitor of the Na(+)/Ca(2+) exchanger (NCX), on Na(+)-dependent Ca(2+) uptake and catecholamine (CA) release were examined in bovine adrenal chromaffin cells that were loaded with Na(+) by treatment with ouabain and veratridine. SEA0400 inhibited Na(+)-dependent (45)Ca(2+) uptake and CA release, with the IC(50) values of 40 and 100 nM, respectively. The IC(50) values of another NCX inhibitor KB-R7943 were 1.8 and 3.7 microM, respectively. These results indicate that SEA0400 is about 40 times more potent than KB-R7943 in inhibiting NCX working in the reverse mode. In intact cells, SEA0400 and KB-R7943 inhibited CA release induced by acetylcholine and DMPP. The IC(50) values of SEA0400 were 5.1 and 4.5 microM and the values of KB-R7943 were 2.6 and 2.1 microM against the release induced by acetylcholine and DMPP, respectively, indicating that the potency of SEA0400 is about a half of that of KB-R7943 in inhibiting the nicotinic receptor-mediated CA release. The binding of [(3)H]nicotine with nicotinic receptors was inhibited by SEA0400 (IC(50) = 90 microM) and KB-R7943 (IC(50) = 12 microM). From these results, it is concluded that unlike KB-R7943, SEA0400 has a potent and selective action on NCX in bovine adrenal chromaffin cells.

The effect of the newly synthesized compound 2-[4-[(2,5-difluorophenyl)methoxy]phenoxy]-5-ethoxyaniline (SEA0400) on the Na+-Ca2+ exchanger (NCX) was investigated and compared against that of 2-[2-[4-(4-nitrobenzyloxy)phenyl]ethyl]isothiourea (KB-R7943). In addition, the effects of SEA0400 on reperfusion injury in vitro and in vivo were examined. SEA0400 was extremely more potent than KB-R7943 in inhibiting Na+-dependent Ca2+ uptake in cultured neurons, astrocytes, and microglia: IC50s of SEA0400 and KB-R7943 were 5 to 33 nM and 2 to 4 microM, respectively. SEA0400 at the concentration range that inhibited NCX exhibited negligible affinities for the Ca2+ channels, Na+ channels, K+ channels, norepinephrine transporter, and 14 receptors, and did not affect the activities of the Na+/H+ exchanger, Na+,K+-ATPase, Ca2+-ATPase, and five enzymes. SEA0400, unlike KB-R7943, did not inhibit the store-operated Ca2+ entry in cultured astrocytes. SEA0400 attenuated dose- dependently paradoxical Ca2+ challenge-induced production of reactive oxygen species, DNA ladder formation, and nuclear condensation in cultured astrocytes, whereas it did not affect thapsigargin-induced cell injury. Furthermore, administration of SEA0400 reduced infarct volumes after a transient middle cerebral artery occlusion in rat cerebral cortex and striatum. These results indicate that SEA0400 is the most potent and selective inhibitor of NCX, and suggest that the compound may exert protective effects on postischemic brain damage.
