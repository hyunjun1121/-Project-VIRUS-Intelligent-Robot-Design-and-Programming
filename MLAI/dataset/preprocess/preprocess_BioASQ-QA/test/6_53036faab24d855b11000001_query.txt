What is the incidence of sudden cardiac death among young athletes?

[PMID: 19734497]
The incidence of sudden cardiac death (SCD) among young athletes is estimated to be 1-3 per 100,000 person years, and may be underestimated. The risk of SCD in athletes is higher than in non-athletes because of several factors associated with sports activity that increase the risk in people with an underlying cardiovascular abnormality. A clear gender difference in the incidence of SCD exists in young athletes, with the risk in male athletes being up to 9 times higher than in female athletes. The most common causes of SCD in young athletes is underlying inherited/congenital cardiac disease, such as cardiomyopathies, congenital coronary anomalies and ion channelopathies. Blunt chest trauma also may cause ventricular fibrillation in a structurally normal heart, known as commotio cordis. Although geographical differences in the causes of SCD in young athletes have been reported, these disparities are more likely to be related to the type and implementation of pre-participation screening leading to the identification of athletes at risk, rather than reflecting a truly different ethiology. More studies are needed to clarify the role of ethnicity in the prevalence of diseases known to cause SCD in young athletes.

Sudden cardiac death is the leading cause of mortality among young athletes with an incidence of 1-2 per 100,000 athletes per annum. It is described as 'an event that is non-traumatic, non-violent, unexpected, and resulting from sudden cardiac arrest within six hours of previously witnessed normal health'. Most predisposed athletes have no symptoms and there is no warning for the impending tragic event. The majority of cases are caused by an underlying structural cardiac abnormality, most commonly hypertrophic cardiomyopathy. More recently, the understanding of non-structural causes such as long QT syndrome and Brugada syndrome has grown and diagnostic criteria have been developed. This review presents the known aetiologies of sudden cardiac death among athletes and outlines their identification and management including implications for future sporting participation as laid out in the consensus documents produced by the European Society of Cardiology and the 36th Bethesda Conference.

This study reports on sudden cardiac death (SCD) in sport in the literature and aims at achieving a generally acceptable preparticipation screening protocol (PPSP) endorsed by the consensus meeting of the International Olympic Committee (IOC). The sudden death of athletes under 35 years engaged in competitive sports is a well-known occurrence; the incidence is higher in athletes (approximately 2/100,000 per year) than in non-athletes (2.5 : 1), and the cause is cardiovascular in over 90%. A systematic review of the literature identified causes of SCD, sex, age, underlying cardiac disease and the type of sport and PPSP in use. Methods necessary to detect pre-existing cardiac abnormalities are discussed to formulate a PPSP for the Medical Commission of the IOC. SCD occurred in 1101 (1966-2004) reported cases in athletes under 35 years, 50% had congenital anatomical heart disease and cardiomyopathies and 10% had early-onset atherosclerotic heart disease. Forty percent occurred in athletes under 18 years, 33% under 16 years; the female/male ratio was 1/9. SCD was reported in almost all sports; most frequently involved were soccer (30%), basketball (25%) and running (15%). The PPSP were of varying quality and content. The IOC consensus meeting accepted the proposed Lausanne Recommendations based on this research and expert opinions (http://multimedia.olympic.org/pdf/en_report_886.pdf). SCD occurs more frequently in young athletes, even those under the age of 18 years, than expected and is predominantly caused by pre-existing congenital cardiac abnormalities. Premature atherosclerotic disease forms another important cause in these young adults. A generally acceptable PPSP has been achieved by the IOC's acceptance of the Lausanne Recommendations.

The problem of sudden death in the young is currently debated and measures for prevention are being evaluated worldwide. Information on the incidence and causes of sudden (cardiac) death in the young (1-40 years) is essential for the development of these preventive strategies. Incidence estimates and causes of death were determined using death certificate data of out-of-hospital sudden deaths recorded by Statistics Netherlands from 1996 to 2006. To define sudden death, International Classification of Diseases codes were selected based on a systematic review of the literature assessing the most common causes of sudden death in the young. The incidence of sudden death was 2.07 (2.06-2.07 per 100 000 person-years). The incidence was higher for men (2.86 per 100 000 person-years) than for women (1.24 per 100 000 person-years) and increased by age. The majority of sudden deaths was of cardiac origin. Sudden cardiac death incidence was 1.62 (1.61-1.62 per 100 000 person-years). In 9% the cause of death remained unexplained. The incidence of sudden death in the young is 2.07 per 100 000 person-years. Treatable cardiac causes (such as coronary atherosclerosis and inherited cardiac diseases) are often underlying for the sudden death. This information is helpful in the development of preventive strategies.

Sudden cardiac death in a young athlete is a tragic and marking event, even though the media attention it gets is more important than its incidence (1-2/100000 per year). The main etiology is hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, followed by coronary artery anomalies. Sometimes signs of myocarditis are found at autopsy. The pre-participation examination recommandations ask for oriented history and physical examination, routine EKG being controversial. A systematic screening program in Italy has reduced the occurrence of such deaths, which statistics are non-existant in Switzerland. It would be appropriate to implement a standardized pre-participation examination, as well as to make sure that the trainers, teachers and athletes themselves are able to recognize the frequent warning symptoms.

Previous events evidence that sudden cardiac death (SCD) in athletes is still a reality and it keeps challenging cardiologists. Considering the importance of SCD in athletes and the requisite for an update of this matter, we endeavored to describe SCD in athletes. The Medline (via PubMed) and SciELO databases were searched using the subject keywords "sudden death, athletes and mortality". The incidence of SCD is expected at one case for each 200,000 young athletes per year. Overall it is resulted of complex dealings of factors such as arrhythmogenic substrate, regulator and triggers factors. In great part of deaths caused by heart disease in athletes younger than 35 years old investigations evidence cardiac congenital abnormalities. Athletes above 35 years old possibly die due to impairments of coronary heart disease, frequently caused by atherosclerosis. Myocardial ischemia and myocardial infarction are responsible for the most cases of SCD above this age (80%). Pre-participatory athletes' evaluation helps to recognize situations that may put the athlete's life in risk including cardiovascular diseases. In summary, cardiologic examinations of athletes' pre-competition routine is an important way to minimize the risk of SCD.
