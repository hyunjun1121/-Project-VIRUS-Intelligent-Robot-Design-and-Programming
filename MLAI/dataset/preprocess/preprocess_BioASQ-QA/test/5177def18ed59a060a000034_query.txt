Which is the molecular mechanism underlying K-ras alterations in carcinomas?

[PMID: 19509115]
Activating point mutations in the K-Ras oncogene are among the most common genetic alterations in pancreatic cancer, occurring early in the progression of the disease. However, the function of mutant K-Ras activity in tumor angiogenesis remains poorly understood. Using human pancreatic duct epithelial (HPDE) and K-Ras4B(G12V)-transformed HPDE (HPDE-KRas) cells, we show that activated K-Ras significantly enhanced the production of angiogenic factors including CXC chemokines and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF). Western blot analysis revealed that K-Ras activation promoted the phosphorylation of Raf/mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase-1/2 (MEK1/2) and expression of c-Jun. MEK1/2 inhibitors, U0126 and PD98059, significantly inhibited the secretion of both CXC chemokines and VEGF, whereas the c-Jun NH(2)-terminal kinase inhibitor SP600125 abrogated only CXC chemokine production. To further elucidate the biological functions of oncogenic K-Ras in promoting angiogenesis, we did in vitro invasion and tube formation assays using human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVEC). HUVEC cocultured with HPDE-KRas showed significantly enhanced invasiveness and tube formation as compared with either control (without coculture) or coculture with HPDE. Moreover, SB225002 (a CXCR2 inhibitor) and 2C3 (an anti-VEGF monoclonal antibody) either alone or in a cooperative manner significantly reduced the degree of both Ras-dependent HUVEC invasiveness and tube formation. Similar results were obtained using another pair of immortalized human pancreatic duct-derived cells, E6/E7/st and its oncogenic K-Ras variant, E6/E7/Ras/st. Taken together, our results suggest that angiogenesis is initiated by paracrine epithelial secretion of CXC chemokines and VEGF downstream of activated oncogenic K-Ras, and that this vascular maturation is in part dependent on MEK1/2 and c-Jun signaling.

The survival of stage II colorectal cancer (CRC) patients is approximately 70% at 5 years. Identification of the patient subgroup at high risk for tumour recurrence and death would allow more informed use of chemotherapy for this stage of disease. Several clinical and pathological factors have been reported to associate with worse survival. In the present study we investigated the prognostic significance of two major genetic alterations in CRC: microsatellite instability (MSI+) and the type of Ki-RAS mutation. PCR-based molecular techniques were used to screen for MSI+ and Ki-RAS mutation in 396 stage II CRC patients with an average follow-up time of 75 months. Clinicopathological information was obtained by retrospective review of pathology reports. Prominent vascular invasion was identified in 19% of cases and was found to be an independent prognostic factor for poor outcome (relative risk = 2.08, 95% confidence interval: 1.22-3.57, p = 0.008). The MSI+ phenotype was found in 23% of proximal tumours and Ki-RAS mutations in 38% of the overall series. Neither MSI+ nor the type of Ki-RAS mutation showed prognostic significance in this cohort of stage II CRC. MSI+ and Ki-RAS mutation type are not useful markers for the identification of high-risk stage II CRC patients. Further prospective and/or cohort studies are required to determine whether these molecular changes have predictive value for survival benefit from 5-fluorouracil-based adjuvant chemotherapy.

Mutation of the KRAS gene predicts the clinical response to the monoclonal antibody cetuximab in patients with advanced colorectal cancer (CRC). This study aimed to perform KRAS mutation detection on formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded (FFPE) tumour tissue by two different methods for comparison. The FFPE sample was microdissected to enrich for tumour cells. KRAS exon 2 mutations were performed on 100 Chinese patients with CRC by direct nucleotide sequencing and high-resolution melting (HRM) analysis. KRAS exon 2 mutations were detected in a total of 62 patients with the two methods combined, comprising 11 different mutant alleles. Three common mutations p.Gly12Asp, p.Gly12Val and p.Gly13Asp accounted for approximately 70% of all cases. The concordant rate between the two methods was 95%. Four mutations not initially detected by direct sequencing were identified by HRM and confirmed by sequencing of the HRM amplicons. One mutation detected by direct sequencing was inadvertently grouped as a wild-type allele by HRM software, but this was readily rectified through manual review. HRM analysis is a sensitive method of detecting KRAS mutation on FFPE tumour tissue to guide cetuximab treatment and is applicable to routine molecular diagnostic service. Utilisation of HRM to screen for mutations upfront economises the resource used in the sequencing reaction.

Mutations at codon 12 of the K-ras gene are present in 65%-100% of carcinomas of human exocrine pancreas and could be used as a potential tumor marker at the tissue level. The purpose of this study was to assess, in large series of patients, the utility of K-ras mutation analysis to evaluate fine-needle aspirates of pancreatic masses. One hundred fifteen fine-needle aspirates obtained from 93 patients were evaluated retrospectively. Cytological analysis was based on the review of cell blocks. Mutations were detected by using artificial restriction fragment length polymorphisms using the Hphl and BstNl approaches. The sensitivity and specificity of cell block cytology was 64% and 100%, respectively, for the diagnosis of pancreatic carcinoma. K-ras mutations were detected in 41 pancreatic carcinomas (sensitivity, 59%) and in one mucinous cystic tumor; specificity of ras analysis alone was 100%. The sensitivity of cytology combined with K-ras mutations were 77.6% and 100%, respectively. The detection of K-ras mutations would have suggested the diagnosis of pancreatic cancer in 14 cases otherwise not detected by cytology alone. K-ras mutation analysis should be restricted to cell blocks containing suspicious, normal-appearing duct cells, or insufficient material in the cytological examination.

Somatic, gain-of-function mutations in ras genes were the first specific genetic alterations identified in human cancer about 3 decades ago. Studies during the last quarter century have characterized the Ras proteins as essential components of signaling networks controlling cellular proliferation, differentiation, or survival. The oncogenic mutations of the H-ras, N-ras, or K-ras genes frequently found in human tumors are known to throw off balance the normal outcome of those signaling pathways, thus leading to tumor development. Oncogenic mutations in a number of other upstream or downstream components of Ras signaling pathways (including membrane RTKs or cytosolic kinases) have been detected more recently in association with a variety of cancers. Interestingly, the oncogenic Ras mutations and the mutations in other components of Ras/MAPK signaling pathways appear to be mutually exclusive events in most tumors, indicating that deregulation of Ras-dependent signaling is the essential requirement for tumorigenesis. In contrast to sporadic tumors, separate studies have identified germline mutations in Ras and various other components of Ras signaling pathways that occur in specific association with a number of different familial, developmental syndromes frequently sharing common phenotypic cardiofaciocutaneous features. Finally, even without being a causative force, defective Ras signaling has been cited as a contributing factor to many other human illnesses, including diabetes and immunological and inflammatory disorders. We aim this review at summarizing and updating current knowledge on the contribution of Ras mutations and altered Ras signaling to development of various tumoral and nontumoral pathologies.

Mutations in the K-ras oncogene and in the p53 tumor suppressor gene are commonly identified in sporadic cases of pancreatic adenocarcinoma. Although these genes might serve as useful markers for early diagnosis of pancreatic carcinoma in patients at risk for the development of this disease, familial pancreatic carcinomas have not been studied for these mutations. We recently had the opportunity to examine a pancreas prophylactically removed from a patient with a strong family history of pancreatic carcinoma. This gave us the unique opportunity to study the early events in the development of familial adenocarcinoma of the pancreas. Histopathological examination of the pancreas revealed multifocal papillary and nonpapillary mucinous duct hyperplasia. Seven of these foci were microdissected and analyzed for K-ras and p53 mutations. The K-ras mutations were detected by combined mutant-enriched polymerase chain reaction-restriction fragment length polymorphism analysis and characterized further by allele-specific oligonucleotide hybridization. Five of the seven duct lesions harbored activating point mutations in codon 12 of K-ras; a G to A transition was found in four and a G to C transversion in one. In contrast, these lesions did not harbor detectable p53 mutations as determined by denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis of exons 5 to 8, nor was there overexpression of the p53 protein as determined by immunohistochemistry. These findings suggest that mutations in K-ras represent an early event in the pathogenesis of pancreatic carcinoma. In addition, monitoring of patients with a strong family history of pancreatic carcinoma for K-ras mutations may identify patients at risk for the development of invasive carcinoma.

Although activating mutations in KRAS are identified in most pancreatic cancers and a large number of other neoplasms, our understanding of the precise molecular and cellular mechanisms that constitute the oncogenic effects of mutant KRAS has been insufficient to formulate an effective therapeutic strategy for affected patients. Interestingly, we have observed that supraphysiological expression of oncogenic Ras causes premature senescence, while endogenous expression of oncogenic Ras confers immortalization in primary murine cells. This suggests that the predominant biological systems previously used to evaluate oncogenic Ras may not reflect the true molecular or cellular properties of this oncogene. Here, we review the use of conditional oncogenic mutations in the endogenous Kras allele as a system for exploring oncogenic Kras biochemistry, cell biology, and tumor modeling.

Activating K-ras mutations are found in approximately 90% of pancreatic carcinomas and may contribute to the poor prognosis of these tumors. Because radiotherapy is frequently used in pancreatic cancer treatment, we assessed the contribution of oncogenic K-ras signaling to pancreatic cancer radiosensitivity. Seven human pancreatic carcinoma lines with activated K-ras and two cell lines with wild-type ras were used to examine clonogenic cell survival after Ras inhibition. Ras inhibition was accomplished by small interfering RNA (siRNA) knockdown of K-ras expression and by blocking Ras processing using a panel of prenyltransferase inhibitors of differing specificity for the two prenyltransferases that modify K-Ras. K-ras knockdown by siRNA or inhibition of prenyltransferase activity resulted in radiation sensitization in vitro and in vivo in tumors with oncogenic K-ras mutations. Inhibition of farnesyltransferase alone was sufficient to radiosensitize most K-ras mutant tumors, although K-Ras prenylation was not blocked. These results show that inhibition of activated K-Ras can promote radiation killing of pancreatic carcinoma in a superadditive manner. The finding that farnesyltransferase inhibition alone radiosensitizes tumors with K-ras mutations implies that a farnesyltransferase inhibitor-sensitive protein other than K-Ras may contribute to survival in the context of mutant K-ras. Farnesyltransferase inhibitors could therefore be of use as sensitizers for pancreatic carcinoma radiotherapy.

Activating mutations in one allele of an oncogene (heterozygous mutations) are widely believed to be sufficient for tumorigenesis. However, mutant allele specific imbalance (MASI) has been observed in tumors and cell lines harboring mutations of oncogenes. We determined 1) mutational status, 2) copy number gains (CNGs) and 3) relative ratio between mutant and wild type alleles of KRAS, BRAF, PIK3CA and EGFR genes by direct sequencing and quantitative PCR assay in over 400 human tumors, cell lines, and xenografts of lung, colorectal, and pancreatic cancers. Examination of a public database indicated that homozygous mutations of five oncogenes were frequent (20%) in 833 cell lines of 12 tumor types. Our data indicated two major forms of MASI: 1) MASI with CNG, either complete or partial; and 2) MASI without CNG (uniparental disomy; UPD), due to complete loss of wild type allele. MASI was a frequent event in mutant EGFR (75%) and was due mainly to CNGs, while MASI, also frequent in mutant KRAS (58%), was mainly due to UPD. Mutant: wild type allelic ratios at the genomic level were precisely maintained after transcription. KRAS mutations or CNGs were significantly associated with increased ras GTPase activity, as measured by ELISA, and the two molecular changes were synergistic. Of 237 lung adenocarcinoma tumors, the small number with both KRAS mutation and CNG were associated with shortened survival. MASI is frequently present in mutant EGFR and KRAS tumor cells, and is associated with increased mutant allele transcription and gene activity. The frequent finding of mutations, CNGs and MASI occurring together in tumor cells indicates that these three genetic alterations, acting together, may have a greater role in the development or maintenance of the malignant phenotype than any individual alteration.

Pulmonary pleomorphic carcinoma (PPC) is a rare type of lung cancer characterized by the poor response to conventional chemotherapy and subsequent disappointing outcomes. Therefore, it is paramount to delineate the molecular characteristics of this disease entity. In this study, we retrospectively examined the surgical specimens of 61 patients who underwent lung surgery. Mutational or gene amplification statuses of epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR), k-ras, c-kit, c-met, and fibroblast growth factor receptor (FGFR) were examined using genomic DNA sequencing, real-time PCR and/or fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH). The median age was 61 years, and 50 patients were men and 11 were women. In the histologic review of epithelial component, adenocarcinoma were in 44 cases (72%), squamous cell carcinoma in 15 (25%) and large cell carcinoma in 2 patients (3%). Overall, 30 cases (49%) had any molecular alterations. Nine patients (15%) possessed EGFR deletion in exon 19 (n = 8) or L858R mutations in exon 21 (n = 1), while 3 other cases having atypical EGFR mutations. Six patients (9.8%) had k-ras mutations in exon 12, and 3 had c-kit mutations. High gene copy number of c-met was found in 11 patients (18.0%) and that of FGFR was in 6 patients (9.8%). No significant relationships were identified among the occurrence and type of mutations and patient survival or any other clinicopathological variables. Given the diverse repertoire of mutational profiles observed in PPC samples, clinical trials based on accurate cancer-genotyping should be considered as a legitimate treatment scheme for this rare disease entity in the future.

Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) is one of the most lethal cancers worldwide. Despite significant progresses in the last decades, the origin of this cancer remains unclear and no efficient therapy exists. PDAC does not arise de novo: three remarkable different types of pancreatic lesions can evolve towards pancreatic cancer. These precursor lesions include: Pancreatic intraepithelial neoplasia (PanIN) that are microscopic lesions of the pancreas, Intraductal Papillary Mucinous Neoplasms (IPMN) and Mucinous Cystic Neoplasms (MCN) that are both macroscopic lesions. However, the cellular origin of these lesions is still a matter of debate. Classically, neoplasm initiation or progression is driven by several genetic and epigenetic alterations. The aim of this review is to assemble the current information on genetic mutations and epigenetic disorders that affect genes during pancreatic carcinogenesis. We will further discuss the interest of the genetic and epigenetic alterations for the diagnosis and prognosis of PDAC. Large genetic alterations (chromosomal deletion/amplification) and single point mutations are well described for carcinogenesis inducers. Mutations classically occur within key regions of the genome. Consequences are various and include activation of mitogenic pathways or silencing of apoptotic processes. Alterations of K-RAS, P16 and DPC4 genes are frequently observed in PDAC samples and have been described to arise gradually during carcinogenesis. DNA methylation is an epigenetic process involved in imprinting and X chromosome inactivation. Alteration of DNA methylation patterns leads to deregulation of gene expression, in the absence of mutation. Both genetic and epigenetic events influence genes and non-coding RNA expression, with dramatic effects on proliferation, survival and invasion. Besides improvement in our fundamental understanding of PDAC development, highlighting the molecular alterations that occur in pancreatic carcinogenesis could provide new clinical tools for early diagnosis of PDAC and the molecular basis for the development of new effective therapies.
