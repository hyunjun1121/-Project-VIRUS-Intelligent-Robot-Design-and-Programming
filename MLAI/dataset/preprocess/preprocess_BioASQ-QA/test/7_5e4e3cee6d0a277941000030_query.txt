Which component of the Influenza A Virus affects mRNA transcription termination?

[PMID: 21118126]
Viruses utilize a number of translational control mechanisms to regulate the relative expression levels of viral proteins on polycistronic mRNAs. One such mechanism, that of termination-dependent reinitiation, has been described in a number of both negative- and positive-strand RNA viruses. Dicistronic RNAs which exhibit termination-reinitiation typically have a start codon of the 3'-ORF (open reading frame) proximal to the stop codon of the upstream ORF. For example, the segment 7 RNA of influenza B is dicistronic, and the stop codon of the M1 ORF and the start codon of the BM2 ORF overlap in the pentanucleotide UAAUG (the stop codon of M1 is shown in bold and the start codon of BM2 is underlined). Recent evidence has highlighted the potential importance of mRNA-rRNA interactions in reinitiation on caliciviral and influenza B viral RNAs, probably used to tether 40S ribosomal subunits to the RNA after termination in time for initiation factors to be recruited to the AUG of the downstream ORF. The present review summarizes how such interactions regulate reinitiation in an array of RNA viruses, and discusses what is known about reinitiation in viruses that do not rely on apparent mRNA-rRNA interactions.

Influenza virus gene 8 codes for two nonstructural proteins (NS1 and NS2) which are translated, respectively, from a colinear and an interrupted mRNA. To investigate the mechanism of transcription processing by splicing, cloned full-length NS DNA was inserted into the late region of an SV40 vector. In this manner, transcription of NS RNA from the recombinant initiates and terminates using SV40 control sequences. RNA mapping and sequence analysis showed that the RNA transcripts are processed to produce both the spliced and unspliced NS mRNAs in approximately equal abundance. The junction sequence of the spliced mRNA is identical to that of NS2 mRNA found in influenza virus-infected cells. In addition, another mRNA species was found to contain a chimera splice between SV40 and NS sequences. Both NS1 and NS2 polypeptides are produced in the recombinant-infected cells as predicted from sequence analysis. These studies establish that during influenza virus infections processing of the NS1 mRNA transcript undergoes a mechanism of splicing similar to that occurring with DNA-directed RNA transcription.

Influenza virus intimately associates with host RNA polymerase II (Pol II) and mRNA processing machinery. Here, we use mammalian native elongating transcript sequencing (mNET-seq) to examine Pol II behavior during viral infection. We show that influenza virus executes a two-pronged attack on host transcription. First, viral infection causes decreased Pol II gene occupancy downstream of transcription start sites. Second, virus-induced cellular stress leads to a catastrophic failure of Pol II termination at poly(A) sites, with transcription often continuing for tens of kilobases. Defective Pol II termination occurs independently of the ability of the viral NS1 protein to interfere with host mRNA processing. Instead, this termination defect is a common effect of diverse cellular stresses and underlies the production of previously reported downstream-of-gene transcripts (DoGs). Our work has implications for understanding not only host-virus interactions but also fundamental aspects of mammalian transcription.

Viral infection perturbs host cells and can be used to uncover regulatory mechanisms controlling cellular responses and susceptibility to infections. Using cell biological, biochemical, and genetic tools, we reveal that influenza A virus (IAV) infection induces global transcriptional defects at the 3' ends of active host genes and RNA polymerase II (RNAPII) run-through into extragenic regions. Deregulated RNAPII leads to expression of aberrant RNAs (3' extensions and host-gene fusions) that ultimately cause global transcriptional downregulation of physiological transcripts, an effect influencing antiviral response and virulence. This phenomenon occurs with multiple strains of IAV, is dependent on influenza NS1 protein, and can be modulated by SUMOylation of an intrinsically disordered region (IDR) of NS1 expressed by the 1918 pandemic IAV strain. Our data identify a strategy used by IAV to suppress host gene expression and indicate that polymorphisms in IDRs of viral proteins can affect the outcome of an infection.

Viruses have evolved a number of translational control mechanisms to regulate the levels of expression of viral proteins on polycistronic mRNAs, including programmed ribosomal frameshifting and stop codon readthrough. More recently, another unusual mechanism has been described, that of termination-dependent re-initiation (also known as stop-start). Here, the AUG start codon of a 3' ORF (open reading frame) is proximal to the termination codon of a uORF (upstream ORF), and expression of the two ORFs is coupled. For example, segment 7 mRNA of influenza B is bicistronic, and the stop codon of the M1 ORF and the start codon of the BM2 ORF overlap in the pentanucleotide UAAUG (stop codon of M1 is shown in boldface and start codon of BM2 is underlined). This short review aims to provide some insights into how this translational coupling process is regulated within different viral systems and to highlight some of the differences in the mechanism of re-initiation on prokaryotic, eukaryotic and viral mRNAs.

Rapid diagnostic identification of the human H5 influenza virus is a strategic cornerstone for outbreak prevention. We recently reported a method for direct detection of viral RNA from a highly pathogenic human H5 influenza strain (A/Hanoi/30408/2005(H5N1)), which necessarily was transcribed in vitro from non-viral sources. This article provides an in-depth analysis of the reaction conditions for in vitro transcription (IVT) of full-length influenza H5 RNA, which is needed for diagnostic RNA production, for the T7 and SP6 phage promoter systems. Gel analysis of RNA transcribed from plasmids containing the H5 sequence between a 5' SP6 promoter and 3' restriction site (BsmBI) showed that three sequence-verified bands at 1,776, 784, and 591 bases were consistently produced, whereas only one 1,776-base band was expected. These fragments were not observed in H1 or H3 influenza RNA transcribed under similar conditions. A reverse complement of the sequence produced only a single band at 1,776 bases, which suggested either self-cleavage or early termination. Aliquots of the IVT reaction were quenched with EDTA to track the generation of the bands over time, which maintained a constant concentration ratio. The H5 sequence was cloned with T7 and SP6 RNA polymerase promoters to allow transcription in either direction with either polymerase. The T7 transcription product from purified, restricted plasmids in the vRNA direction only produced the 1,776-base full-length sequence and the 784-base fragment, instead of the three bands generated by the SP6 system, suggesting an early termination mechanism. Additionally, the T7 system produced a higher fraction of full-length vRNA transcripts than the SP6 system did under similar reaction conditions. By sequencing we identified a type II RNA hairpin loop terminator, which forms in a transcription direction-dependent fashion. Variation of the magnesium concentration produced the greatest impact on termination profiles, where some reaction mixtures were unable to produce full-length transcripts. Optimized conditions are presented for the T7 and SP6 phage polymerase systems to minimize these early termination events during in vitro transcription of H5 influenza vRNA.

Carbocyclic 2',3'-didehydro-2',3'-dideoxyguanosine (carbovir, NSC 614846) is an anti-retroviral agent that may be useful in the treatment of AIDS. We have examined the ability of (-)-enantiomeric carbovir triphosphate to inhibit human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) reverse transcriptase (EC 2.7.7.49). A comparison of inhibition kinetics was made with 3'-azido-2',3'-dideoxythymidine triphosphate and phosphonoformate. Inhibition of the reverse transcriptase was evaluated using poly(rA).oligo(dT)12-18, poly(rC).oligo(dG)12-18, or influenza virion RNA template with a specific oligodeoxynucleotide as primer. (-)-Carbovir 5'-triphosphate was shown to be a potent inhibitor of HIV-1 reverse transcriptase with an apparent Ki similar to that of 3'-azido-2',3'-dideoxythymidine triphosphate. Chain elongation studies utilizing an MS2 RNA template showed that (-)-carbovir 5'-triphosphate terminated transcription at positions identical to those where dideoxy-GTP terminated. This indicates that (-)-carbovir 5'-monophosphate is incorporated into the newly synthesized DNA and terminates transcription at that point. We conclude that (-)-carbovir 5'-triphosphate is a potent inhibitor of the HIV-1 reverse transcriptase enzyme and that (-)-carbovir most likely inhibits HIV by activity at the triphosphate level by a combination of direct competition for binding of the natural deoxynucleoside triphosphates to the reverse transcriptase and chain termination.
