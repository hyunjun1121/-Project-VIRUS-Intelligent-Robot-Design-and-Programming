What is MACE in the context of cardiotoxicity?

[PMID: 34396256]
Immune checkpoint inhibitor (ICI)-related cardiotoxicity (iRC) is uncommon but can be fatal. There have been few reports of iRC from a rural cancer population and few data for iRC and inflammatory biomarkers. The purpose of this study was to characterize major adverse cardiac events (MACE) in ICI-treated lung cancer patients based in a rural setting and to assess the utility of C-reactive protein (CRP) and neutrophil-lymphocyte ratio (NLR) in the diagnosis of iRC. Patients with lung cancer treated with ICIs at Vidant Medical Center/East Carolina University (VMC/ECU) between 2015 and 2018 were retrospectively identified. MACE included myocarditis, non-ST-segment elevated myocardial infarction (NSTEMI), supraventricular tachycardia (SVT), and pericardial disorders. Medical history, laboratory values, pre-ICI electrocardiography (ECG), and echocardiography results were compared in patients with and without MACE. Among 196 ICI-treated patients, 23 patients (11%) developed MACE at a median of 46 days from the first ICI infusion (interquartile range [IQR]: 17 to 83 days). Patients who developed MACE experienced myocarditis (n = 9), NSTEMI (n = 3), SVT (n = 7), and pericardial disorders (n = 4). Ejection fraction was not significantly different at the time of MACE compared to that at baseline (p = 0.495). Compared to baseline values, NLR (10.9 ± 8.3 vs. 20.7 ± 4.2, respectively; p = 0.032) and CRP (42.1 ± 10.1 mg/l vs. 109.9 ± 15.6 mg/l, respectively; p = 0.010) were significantly elevated at the time of MACE. NLR and CRP were significantly elevated at the time of MACE compared to baseline values in ICI-treated patients. Larger datasets are needed to validate these findings and identify predictors of MACE that can be used in the diagnosis and management of ICI-related iRC.

Cardiovascular disease is second only to cancer recurrence as a determinant of lifespan in cancer survivors, and cancer therapy-related cardiac dysfunction is a clinically important risk factor. We aim to investigate the use of cardiac magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) to evaluate early tissue changes and perform functional assessment of chemo- and radiation-induced cardiotoxicity and to identify MRI prognostic indicators of cardiotoxicity in breast cancer patients. A 3-min cardiac imaging protocol will be added to the breast MRI examination to diagnose cardiotoxicity in breast cancer patients. Standardized MRI-based evaluation of breast cancer and the left ventricular myocardium will be performed at baseline and at 3, 6, and 12 months and 2 years or more after cancer treatment. We will analyze both ventricular volume and ejection fraction (EF), strain of left ventricle (LV), native T1, extracellular volume fraction (ECV), and T2 values acquired in the mid LV. The primary result of this study will be the comparison of the prognostic value of MRI parameters (native T1, ECV, both ventricular systolic function and LV strain) for cardiotoxicity. The endpoint is defined as the occurrence of a major adverse cardiac event (MACE). The secondary outcome will be an assessment of the temporal relationships between contractile dysfunction and microstructural injury over 4 years using MRI. This study will assess the usefulness of quantitative MRI to diagnose cardiotoxicity and will clarify the temporal relationships between contractile dysfunction and microstructural injury of the LV myocardium using MRI during breast cancer treatment. The protocol was registered at clinicaltrials.gov (Clinical trial no. NCT03301389) on October 4, 2017.

The purpose of this study was to investigate the impact of everolimus-eluting stents (EES) in comparison with bare-metal stents (BMS), sirolimus-eluting stents (SES), and paclitaxel-eluting stents (PES) on the 6-month clinical outcomes in an all-comer population. EES have been shown to be effective in the context of randomized trials with selected patients. The effect of EES implantation in more complex, unselected patients cannot be directly extrapolated from these findings. In total, 649 consecutive unselected patients treated exclusively with EES were enrolled. Six-month clinical end points were compared with 3 historical cohorts (BMS, n = 450; SES, n = 508; and PES, n = 576). Major adverse cardiac events (MACE) were defined as a composite of all-cause mortality, myocardial infarction, or target vessel revascularization (TVR). The patients treated with EES were older, presented more frequently with acute myocardial infarction, and had more complicated lesions than the other groups. The EES group demonstrated a higher incidence of all-cause mortality than the SES group and a lower incidence of TVR than the BMS group. Multivariate adjustment demonstrated that BMS was associated with higher TVR and MACE risk than EES (adjusted hazard ratio [HR] for TVR: 2.02 [95% confidence interval (CI): 1.11 to 3.67]; adjusted HR for MACE: 2.15 [95% CI: 1.36 to 3.42]); that SES had a clinical outcome similar to that of EES, and that PES had a higher risk of MACE than did EES (adjusted HR: 1.57 [95% CI: 1.02 to 2.44]). This study suggests that the use of EES in an unselected population may be as safe as and more effective than BMS, may be as safe and effective as SES, may be as safe as PES, and may be more effective than PES.

The objective of this study was to quantify the sensitivity of very low concentrations of high-sensitivity cardiac troponin T (hsTnT) at ED arrival for acute myocardial infarction (AMI) in a large cohort of chest pain patients evaluated in real-world clinical practice. This retrospective study included consecutive ED patients with suspected cardiac chest pain evaluated in four urban EDs, excluding those with ST-elevation AMI, cardiac arrest or abnormal kidney function. The primary outcomes were AMI at 7, 30, and 90 days. Secondary outcomes included major adverse cardiac events (MACE; all-cause mortality, AMI, and revascularization) and the individual MACE components. Test characteristics were calculated for hsTnT values from 3 to 200 ng/L . A total of 7,130 patients met inclusion criteria. AMI incidences at 7, 30, and 90 days were 5.8, 6.0, and 6.2%. When the hsTnT assay was performed at ED arrival, the limit of blank of the assay (3 ng/L) ruled out 7-day AMI in 15.5% of patients with 100% sensitivity and negative predictive value (NPV). The limit of detection of the assay (5 ng/L) ruled out AMI in 33.6% of patients with 99.8% sensitivity and 99.95% NPV for 7-day AMI. The limit of quantification (the Food and Drug Administration [FDA]-approved cutoff for lower the reportable limit) of 6 ng/L ruled out AMI in 42.2% of patients with 99.8% sensitivity and 99.95% NPV. The sensitivities of the cutoffs of <3, <5, and <6 ng/L for 7-day MACE were 99.6, 97.4, and 96.6%, respectively. The NPVs of the cutoffs of <3, <5, and <6 ng/L for 7-day MACE were 99.8, 99.5, and 99.4%, respectively. A secondary analysis was performed in a subgroup of 3,549 higher-risk patients who underwent serial troponin testing. In this subgroup, a cutoff of 3 ng/L ruled out 7-day AMI in 9.6% of patients with 100% sensitivity and NPV, a cutoff of 5 ng/L ruled out 7-day AMI in 23.3% of patients with 99.7% sensitivity and 99.9% NPV, and a cutoff of 6 ng/L ruled out 7-day AMI in 29.8% of patients with 99.7 and 99.9% NPV. In the higher-risk subgroup, the sensitivities of cutoffs of <3, <5, and <6 ng/L for 7-day MACE were 99.8, 97.4, and 96.6%, respectively. In this higher-risk subgroup, the NPV of cutoffs of <3, <5, and <6 ng/L for 7-day MACE were 99.7, 98.5, and 98.4%, respectively. When used in real-world clinical practice conditions, hsTnT concentrations < 6 ng/L (below the lower reportable limit for an FDA-approved assay) at the time of ED arrival can rule out AMI with very high sensitivity and NPV. The sensitivity for MACE is unacceptably low, and thus a single-troponin rule-out strategy should only be used in the context of a structured risk evaluation.

Renal transplantation is the treatment of choice in patients with end-stage renal disease. Major adverse cardiac events (MACE) are common after renal transplant, especially in the perioperative period, leading to excess morbidity and mortality. The predictors and long-term prognostic implications of MACE are poorly understood. We analyzed predictors and implications of MACE in a cohort of 321 consecutive adult patients, who received renal allograft transplantation between 1995 and 2003 at our institution. The characteristics of 321 patients were: age at transplant 44 ± 13 years, 60% male, 36% diabetes mellitus (DM), left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) 60 ± 16%. MACE occurred in 21 patients with cumulative rate of 6.5% over 3 years after renal transplant, 57% occurring within 30 days, 67% within 90 days, and 86% within 180 days. MACE was not predicted by any clinical or pharmacological variables including age, gender, hypertension, DM, prior myocardial infarction, smoking, duration of dialysis, LVEF, or therapy with β-blockers (BB), angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors, or calcium channel blockers. However, a clinical decision to perform a stress test or a coronary angiogram was predictive of higher MACE rate. MACE, irrespective of type, was independently associated with higher mortality over a period up to 15 years and this seemed to be blunted by BB therapy. MACE rate after renal transplantation decreases over time, most occurring in the first 90 days and is not predicted by any of the traditional risk factors or drug therapies. It is associated with higher long-term mortality.

Cancer survivorship status among patients evaluated for chest pain at the emergency department (ED) warrants high degree of suspicion. However, it remains unclear whether cancer survivorship is associated with different risk of major adverse cardiac events (MACE) compared to those with no history of cancer. Furthermore, while HEART score is widely used in ED evaluation, it is unclear whether it can adequately triage chest pain events in cancer survivors. We sought to compare the rate of MACE in patients with a recent history of cancer in remission evaluated for acute chest pain at the ED to those with no history of cancer, and compare the performance of a common chest pain risk stratification score (HEART) between the two groups. We performed a secondary analysis of a prospective observational cohort study of chest pain patients presenting to the EDs of three tertiary care hospitals in the USA. Cancer survivorship status, HEART scores, and the presence of MACE within 30 days of admission were retrospectively adjudicated from the charts. We defined patients with recent history of cancer in remission as those with a past history of cancer of less than 10 years, and currently cured or in remission. The sample included 750 patients (age: 59 ± 17; 42% females, 40% Black), while 69 patients (9.1%) had recent history of cancer in remission. A cancer in remission status was associated with a higher comorbidity burden, older age, and female sex. There was no difference in risk of MACE between those with a cancer in remission and their counterparts in both univariate [17.4 vs. 19.5%, odds ratio (OR) = 0.87 (95% confidence interval (CI), 0.45-1.66], P = 0.67] and multivariable analysis adjusting for demographics and comorbidities [OR = 0.62 (95% CI, 0.31-1.25), P = 0.18]. Patients with cancer in remission had higher HEART score (4.6 ± 1.8 vs. 3.9 ± 2.0, P = 0.006), and a higher proportion triaged as intermediate risk [68 vs. 56%, OR = 1.67 (95% CI, 1.00-2.84), P = 0.05]; however, no difference in the performance of HEART score existed between the groups (area under the curve = 0.86 vs. 0.84, P = 0.76). There was no difference in rate of MACE between those with recent history of cancer in remission compared to their counterparts. A higher proportion of patients with cancer in remission was triaged as intermediate risk by the HEART score, but we found no difference in the performance of the HEART score between the groups.

Plasma ghrelin levels can be elevated in patients with acute heart failure (AHF). This study aimed to analyze the temporal changes and prognostic value of ghrelin levels in patients with AHF. This prospective study included patients with AHF at the Cardiology Department, Weifang People's Hospital (May 2018-October 2019), and age- and sex-matched healthy controls. Plasma ghrelin levels were measured. Multivariable logistic regression and receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analyses were used to evaluate whether ghrelin levels could predict major cardiac adverse events (MACEs) during a 1-year follow-up. Finally, 92 patients with AHF and 50 healthy controls were enrolled. Ghrelin levels were higher in patients with AHF at 1, 3, 12, and 24 h compared with controls (all P < 0.01). Ghrelin levels in the AHF group were higher at 3 and 12 h than at 1 and 24 h (P < 0.001). Ghrelin level at 3 h in patients with AHF was negatively correlated with the left ventricular end-diastolic diameter and left ventricular ejection fraction (both P < 0.05). MACEs occurred in 48 patients with AHF. Ghrelin levels were higher in the MACE group than in the non-MACE group at 1 (P = 0.011) and 3 h (P = 0.034). Multivariable regression showed that ghrelin level at 3 h was independently associated with MACEs [OR = 0.629, 95% confidence interval (CI): 0.515-0.742, P = 0.010], but the area under the ROC curve was only 0.629 (95% CI 0.515-0.742). Plasma ghrelin levels are elevated in AHF and patients with MACEs during follow-up.

The correlation among metabolic syndrome, lower urinary tract symptoms (LUTS), and cardiovascular disease (CVD) is well established. In particular, CVD has been proposed as a potential risk factor for both LUTS progression and severity. To evaluate whether LUTS severity can be considered as a significant risk factor of major adverse cardiac events (MACE) in the male population. A systematic literature search was performed using PubMed, Google Scholar, and Scopus. The combination of the following keywords was adopted in a free-text strategy: benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) or lower urinary tract symptoms (LUTS) and cardiovascular, cardio, major adverse cardiac events, MACE, heart disease, heart, myocardial infarction, myocardial, infarction, stroke, ischemic events, ischemic, cardiac death, coronary syndrome. We included all cross-sectional and longitudinal trials enrolling men and comparing the prevalence or incidence of MACE in men with moderate to severe LUTS compared with those without LUTS or with mild LUTS. The studies in which only nocturia was evaluated were excluded from the analysis. Of 477 retrieved articles, 5 trials longitudinally reported the incidence of MACE in patients with moderate to severe LUTS in comparisons to those with mild or no LUTS and 10 studies reported the prevalence of history of MACE at enrollment. All were included in the present meta-analysis. Among cross-sectional studies, 38 218 patients and 2527 MACE were included in the meta-analysis. The mean age of enrolled patients was 62.2±8.0 yr. Presence of moderate to severe LUTS significantly increased the risk of reported history of MACE (p<0.001). Metaregression analyses showed that the risk of MACE was lower in older patients and higher in those with diabetes. The association between LUTS-related MACE and diabetes was confirmed in a multivariate regression model after adjusting for age (adjusted r=0.498; p<0.0001). Longitudinal trials included 25 494 patients and 2291 MACE. The mean age of enrolled patients was 52.5±5.5 yr, and mean follow-up was 86.8±22.1 mo. Presence of moderate to severe LUTS was associated with an increased incidence of MACE compared with the rest of the sample (odds ratio: 1.68; 95% confidence interval, 1.13-2.50; p=0.01). Men with moderate to severe LUTS seem to have an increased risk of MACE. A holistic approach in considering the morbidities of aging men should be strongly encouraged and represents an important role for the practicing urologist. We evaluated whether the severity of lower urinary tract symptoms could be considered as a significant risk factor for major adverse cardiac events (MACE) in the male population. We demonstrated that men with moderate to severe LUTS have an increased risk of MACE.

Myocarditis is a potentially fatal complication of immune checkpoint inhibitor (ICI) therapy. Data on the utility of cardiovascular magnetic resonance (CMR) T1 and T2 mapping in ICI myocarditis are limited. This study sought to assess the value of CMR T1 and T2 mapping in patients with ICI myocarditis. In this retrospective study from an international registry of patients with ICI myocarditis, clinical and CMR findings (including T1 and T2 maps) were collected. Abnormal T1 and T2 were defined as 2 SD above site (vendor/field strength specific) reference values and a z-score was calculated for each patient. Major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE) were a composite of cardiovascular death, cardiogenic shock, cardiac arrest, and complete heart block. Of 136 patients with ICI myocarditis with a CMR, 86 (63%) had T1 maps and 79 (58%) also had T2 maps. Among the 86 patients (66.3 ± 13.1 years of age), 36 (41.9%) had a left ventricular ejection fraction <55%. Across all patients, mean z-scores for T1 and T2 values were 2.9 ± 1.9 (p < 0.001) and 2.2 ± 2.1 (p < 0.001), respectively. On Siemens 1.5-T scanner (n = 67), native T1 (1,079.0 ± 55.5 ms vs. 1,000.3 ± 22.1 ms; p < 0.001) and T2 (56.2 ± 4.9 ms vs. 49.8 ± 2.2 ms; p < 0.001) values were elevated compared with reference values. Abnormal T1 and T2 values were seen in 78% and 43% of the patients, respectively. Applying the modified Lake Louise Criteria, 95% met the nonischemic myocardial injury criteria and 53% met the myocardial edema criteria. Native T1 values had excellent discriminatory value for subsequent MACE, with an area under the curve of 0.91 (95% confidence interval: 0.84 to 0.98). Native T1 values (for every 1-unit increase in z-score, hazard ratio: 1.44; 95% confidence interval: 1.12 to 1.84; p = 0.004) but not T2 values were independently associated with subsequent MACE. The use of T1 mapping and application of the modified Lake Louise Criteria provides important diagnostic value, and T1 mapping provides prognostic value in patients with ICI myocarditis.

The effectiveness of systemic treatment in advanced hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) depends on the selection of patients, management of cirrhosis complications and expertise to treat adverse events. The aims of the study are to assess the frequency and management of cardiovascular events in HCC patients treated with sorafenib (SOR) and to create a scale to predict the onset of major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE). Observational retrospective study with consecutive HCC patients treated with SOR between 2007 and 2019 in a western centre. In order to classify cardiovascular risk pre-SOR, we designed the CARDIOSOR scale with age, hypertension, diabetes, dyslipidaemia and peripheral vascular disease. Other adverse events, dosing and outcome data were collected during a homogeneous protocolled follow-up. Two hundred ninety-nine patients were included (219 BCLC-C). The median overall survival was 11.1 months (IQR 5.6-20.5), and duration of treatment was 7.4 months (IQR 3.3-14.7). Seventeen patients (6%) stopped SOR due to cardiovascular event. Thirty-three patients suffered MACE (7 heart failure, 11 acute coronary syndrome, 12 cerebrovascular accident and 8 peripheral vascular ischemia); 99 had a minor cardiovascular event, mainly hypertension (n = 81). Age was the only independent factor associated to MACE (HR 1.07; 95% CI 1.03-1.12; P = .002). The CARDIOSOR scale allows to identify the group of patients with higher risk of MACE (sHR 3.4; 95% CI 1.4-6.7; P = .04). The incidence of cardiovascular events in HCC patients treated with SOR is higher than expected. Multidisciplinary approach and clinical tools like CARDIOSOR scale could be helpful to manage these patients.

Main adverse cardiac events (MACE) are essentially composite endpoints for assessing safety and efficacy of treatment processes of acute coronary syndrome (ACS) patients. Timely prediction of MACE is highly valuable for improving the effects of ACS treatments. Most existing tools are specific to predict MACE by mainly using static patient features and neglecting dynamic treatment information during learning. We address this challenge by developing a deep learning-based approach to utilize a large volume of heterogeneous electronic health record (EHR) for predicting MACE after ACS. Specifically, we obtain the deep representation of dynamic treatment features from EHR data, using the bidirectional recurrent neural network. And then, the extracted latent representation of treatment features can be utilized to predict whether a patient occurs MACE in his or her hospitalization. We validate the effectiveness of our approach on a clinical dataset containing 2930 ACS patient samples with 232 static feature types and 2194 dynamic feature types. The performance of our best model for predicting MACE after ACS remains robust and reaches 0.713 and 0.764 in terms of AUC and Accuracy, respectively, and has over 11.9% (1.2%) and 1.9% (7.5%) performance gain of AUC (Accuracy) in comparison with both logistic regression and a boosted resampling model presented in our previous work, respectively. The results are statistically significant. We hypothesize that our proposed model adapted to leverage dynamic treatment information in EHR data appears to boost the performance of MACE prediction for ACS, and can readily meet the demand clinical prediction of other diseases, from a large volume of EHR in an open-ended fashion.

The aim of this study was to evaluate the value of microvascular obstruction (MO) and infarct size as a percentage of left ventricular mass (IS%LV), as measured by contrast-enhanced cardiac magnetic resonance, in predicting major cardiovascular adverse events (MACE) at 2 years in patients with ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction reperfused by primary percutaneous coronary intervention. Individual data from 1,025 patients were entered into the pooled analysis. MO was associated with the occurrence of MACE, defined as a composite of cardiac death, congestive heart failure, and myocardial re-infarction (adjusted hazard ratio: 3.74; 95% confidence interval: 2.21 to 6.34). IS%LV ≥25% was not associated with MACE (adjusted hazard ratio: 0.90; 95% confidence interval: 0.59 to 1.37). The authors conclude that MO is an independent predictor of MACE and cardiac death, whereas IS%LV is not independently associated with MACE.

Anthracyclines are an important component of cancer treatments; however, their use is limited by the occurrence of cardiotoxicity. There are limited data on the occurrence of heart failure and the value of baseline and follow-up measurements of left ventricular (LV) ejection fraction (EF) in the current era. Therefore, the objectives of the present study were twofold: (1) to characterize the occurrence of and risk factors for major adverse cardiac events (MACEs: symptomatic heart failure and cardiac death) in a large contemporaneous population of adult patients treated with anthracyclines and (2) to test the value of LVEF and LV dimensions obtained using echocardiography in the prediction of MACE. Five thousand fifty-seven patients were studied, of whom 124 (2.4%) developed MACE. Of the total cohort, 2,285 patients had an available echocardiogram pre-chemotherapy. Patients with MACE were older (p <0.0001), predominantly men (p = 0.03), and with a higher incidence of cardiovascular risk factors and cardiac treatments. Patients with hematologic cancers had a higher incidence of cardiac events than patients with breast cancer (4.2% vs 0.7%, p <0.0001). Baseline LVEF, LVEF ≤5 points above the lower limits of normal, and LV internal diameter were predictive of the rate of occurrence of MACE. In conclusion, older patients with hematologic cancers and patients with a baseline LVEF ≤5 points above the lower limit of normal have higher incidence of MACE and should be closely monitored.

At present, prognostic biomarkers of acute coronary syndrome (ACS) are fewer. The aim of this study was to explore the predictive value of soluble osteoclast-associated receptor (sOSCAR) level for the major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE) occurring within 30 days after ACS. From January to August 2020, a total of 108 patients with ACS who were admitted to our hospital, were enrolled in this study. Of the 108 patients, 79 were men and 29 women. Patient-related data, including age, sex, body mass index, history of type 2 diabetes, history of hyperlipidemia and serum sOSCAR level, were collected. All patients were followed up for 30 days. Based on MACE occurrence, the 108 patients were divided into MACE group (n = 17) and non-MACE group (n = 91). The baseline data were compared between the two groups, MACE-independent risk factors were identified by multivariate regression analysis, and the predictive value of sOSCAR for MACE occurring within 30 days after CAS was analyzed using receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve. At the same time, according to the type of ACS, the 108 patients with ACS were divided into unstable angina (UA) group (n = 29), non ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction (USTEMI) group (n = 45) and ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) group (n = 34), and then the sOSCAR level and MACE incidence were observed in each group. The serum sOSCAR level was significantly lower in the MACE group [130(100,183)] than in the non-MACE group [301(220,370)] (P = 0.000). The area under ROC curve of sOSCAR level for MACE occurring within 30 days after CAS was 0.860 with 95%CI 0.782-0.919, P < 0.001. Multivariate regression analysis indicated that the sOSCAR level was an independent risk factor for the MACE occurring within 30 days after CAS (OR 0.26, 95%CI 0.087-0.777, P = 0.04). The MACE incidence (0%) was the lowest but the sOSCAR level was the highest in the UA group, while in the STEMI group, the MACE incidence (23.53%) was the higest but the sOSCAR level was the lowest among the UA, STEMI and NSTEMI groups. Serum sOSCAR level may be used as a predictor of MACE occurring within the short-term after ACS. The higher the sOSCAR level, the lower the MACE incidence.

The purpose of this study was to evaluate whether immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) are associated with an increased risk of major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE) compared with non-ICI therapies in patients with lung cancer. ICIs activate the host immune system to target cancer cells. Though uncommon, cardiovascular immune-related adverse events can be life-threatening. A retrospective single-institution cohort study of 252 patients with pathologically confirmed lung cancer who received ICI or non-ICI therapy was analyzed. The primary endpoint was MACE, defined as a composite of cardiovascular death, nonfatal myocardial infarction, nonfatal stroke, and hospitalization for heart failure. During a median follow-up of 6 months, MACE occurred in 13.3% of ICI-treated patients, with a median time to event of 51 days, compared with 10.3% and 64 days in non-ICI patients. ICIs were not associated with MACE (hazard ratio [HR]: 1.18; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.57 to 2.43; p = 0.66) in a univariable Fine-Gray regression analysis incorporating noncardiovascular death as a competing risk. Multivariable regression analyses determined that patients treated with ICIs with elevated serum troponin I >0.01 ng/ml (HR: 7.27; 95% CI: 2.72 to 19.43; p < 0.001) and B-type natriuretic peptide (BNP) >100 pg/ml (HR: 2.65; 95% CI: 1.01 to 6.92; p = 0.047) had an increased risk of MACE. Patients pre-treated or receiving combined immunotherapy with ICIs and vascular endothelial growth factor inhibitors (VEGFIs) or tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) had an increased risk of MACE (HR: 2.15; 95% CI: 1.05 to 4.37; p = 0.04). ICIs were not independently associated with an increased risk of MACE in patients with lung cancer, although power is an important limitation in these analyses. ICI-associated cardiotoxicity was associated with elevations in serum troponin and BNP, and combined immunotherapy with VEGFIs or TKIs. Future studies are needed to further define the role of cardiac biomarkers as a monitoring strategy with ICI therapy.

The study aimed to determine whether high sensitivity C-reactive protein to prealbumin (hs-CRP/PAB) ratio could be used to predict in-hospital major adverse cardiac events (MACE) in patients with acute coronary syndrome (ACS). A total of 659 patients with ACS were included in the study. Patients were divided into two groups: high hs-CRP/PAB ratio group (hs-CRP/PAB ≥0.010) and low hs-CRP/PAB ratio group (hs-CRP/PAB <0.010). MACE was defined as death, cardiogenic shock, re-infarction and acute heart failure. Logistic regression was performed and the receiver operating characteristic curve (ROC) was generated to evaluate the correlation of hs-CRP/PAB ratio and MACE in patients with ACS. The occurrence rate of MACE was significantly higher in high hs-CRP/PAB ratio group when compared with that in low hs-CRP/PAB ratio group (P < 0.001). Multivariable analysis determined that hs-CRP/PAB ratio was an independent predictor of MACE (adjusted odds ratio: 1.276, 95% confidence interval: 1.106-1.471, P = 0.001). Moreover, the area under the curve value of hs-CRP/PAB ratio for predicting MACE was higher than hs-CRP and equal to PAB. High hs-CRP/PAB ratio was considered as a prognostic parameter of MACE in ACS patients, with the predictive power equal to PAB but greater than hs-CRP.

Percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) is associated with excellent short-term improvements in ischemic symptoms, yet only three fifths of PCI patients at 5 years and one third of patients at 10 years remain free of major adverse cardiac events (MACE). To determine whether treatment with fluvastatin reduces MACE in patients who have undergone PCI. Randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial conducted at 77 referral centers in Europe, Canada, and Brazil. A total of 1677 patients (aged 18-80 years) recruited between April 1996 and October 1998 with stable or unstable angina or silent ischemia following successful completion of their first PCI who had baseline total cholesterol levels between 135 and 270 mg/dL (3.5-7.0 mmol/L), with fasting triglyceride levels of less than 400 mg/dL (4.5 mmol/L). Patients were randomly assigned to receive treatment with fluvastatin, 80 mg/d (n = 844), or matching placebo (n = 833) at hospital discharge for 3 to 4 years. Survival time free of MACE, defined as cardiac death, nonfatal myocardial infarction, or reintervention procedure, compared between the treatment and placebo groups. Median time between PCI and first dose of study medication was 2.0 days, and median follow-up was 3.9 years. MACE-free survival time was significantly longer in the fluvastatin group (P =.01). One hundred eighty-one (21.4%) of 844 patients in the fluvastatin group and 222 (26.7%) of 833 patients in the placebo group had at least 1 MACE (relative risk [RR], 0.78; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.64-0.95; P =.01). This result was independent of baseline total cholesterol levels (above [RR, 0.76; 95% CI, 0.56-1.04] vs below [RR, 0.77; 95% CI, 0.57-1.02] the median). In subgroup analysis, the risk of MACE was reduced in patients with diabetes (n = 202; RR, 0.53; 95% CI, 0.29-0.97; P =.04) and in those with multivessel disease (n = 614; RR, 0.66; 95% CI, 0.48-0.91; P =.01) who received fluvastatin compared with those who received placebo. There were no instances of creatine phosphokinase elevations 10 or more times the upper limit of normal or rhabdomyolysis in the fluvastatin group. Fluvastatin treatment in patients with average cholesterol levels undergoing their first successful PCI significantly reduces the risk of major adverse cardiac events.
