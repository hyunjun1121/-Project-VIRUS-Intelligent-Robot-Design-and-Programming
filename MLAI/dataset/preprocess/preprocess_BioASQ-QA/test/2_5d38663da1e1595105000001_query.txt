Which domain of the MOZ/MYST3 protein complex associates with histone H3?

Histone tail modifications control many nuclear processes by dictating the dynamic exchange of regulatory proteins on chromatin. Here we report novel insights into histone H3 tail structure in complex with the double PHD finger (DPF) of the lysine acetyltransferase MOZ/MYST3/KAT6A. In addition to sampling H3 and H4 modification status, we show that the DPF cooperates with the MYST domain to promote H3K9 and H3K14 acetylation, although not if H3K4 is trimethylated. Four crystal structures of an extended DPF alone and in complex with unmodified or acetylated forms of the H3 tail reveal the molecular basis of crosstalk between H3K4me3 and H3K14ac. We show for the first time that MOZ DPF induces Î±-helical conformation of H3K4-T11, revealing a unique mode of H3 recognition. The helical structure facilitates sampling of H3K4 methylation status, and proffers H3K9 and other residues for modification. Additionally, we show that a conserved double glycine hinge flanking the H3 tail helix is required for a conformational change enabling docking of H3K14ac with the DPF. In summary, our data provide the first observations of extensive helical structure in a histone tail, revealing the inherent ability of the H3 tail to adopt alternate conformations in complex with chromatin regulators.

We report that embryos deficient in the histone acetyltransferase Moz (Myst3/Kat6a) show histone H3 lysine 9 (H3K9) hypoacetylation, corresponding H3K9 hypermethylation, and reduced transcription at Hox gene loci. Consistent with an observed caudal shift in Hox gene expression, segment identity is shifted anteriorly, such that Moz-deficient mice show a profound homeotic transformation of the axial skeleton and the nervous system. Intriguingly, histone acetylation defects are relatively specific to H3K9 at Hox loci, as neither Hox H3K14 acetylation nor bulk H3K9 acetylation levels throughout the genome are strongly affected; H4K16 acetylation actually increases in the absence of Moz. H3K9 hypoacetylation, Hox gene repression, and the homeotic transformation caused by lack of Moz are all reversed by treatment with retinoic acid (RA). In conclusion, our data show that Moz regulates H3K9 acetylation at Hox gene loci and that RA can act independently of Moz to establish specific Hox gene expression boundaries.
