Rhomboids are a recently discovered family of widely distributed intramembrane serine proteases. They have diverse biological functions, including the regulation of growth factor signaling, mitochondrial fusion, and parasite invasion. Despite their existence in all branches of life, the sequence identity between rhomboids is low. We have combined BLAST-based database mining with functional and structural data to generate a comprehensive genomic analysis of eukaryotic rhomboid-like proteins. We show that robust membrane topology models are necessary to classify active rhomboid proteases unambiguously, and we define rules for distinguishing predicted active proteases from the larger evolutionary group of rhomboid-like proteins. This leads to a revision of estimates of numbers of proteolytically active rhomboids. We identify three groups of eukaryotic rhomboid-like proteins: true active rhomboids, a tightly clustered group of novel inactive rhomboids that we name the iRhoms, and a small number of other inactive rhomboid-like proteins. The active proteases are themselves subdivided into secretase and PARL-type (mitochondrial) subfamilies; these have distinct transmembrane topologies. This enhanced genomic analysis leads to conclusions about rhomboid enzyme function. It suggests that a given rhomboid can only cleave a single orientation of substrate, and that both products of rhomboid catalyzed intramembrane cleavage can be released from the membrane. Our phylogeny predictions also have evolutionary implications: Despite the complex classification of rhomboids, our data suggest that a rhomboid-type intramembrane protease may have been present in the last eukaryotic common ancestor.

The mitochondrial rhomboid protease Parl governs apoptosis, morphology, metabolism and might be implicated in Parkinson's disease, but the structural basis of its activity and complex regulation remain unknown. We report the discovery of γ-cleavage, a proteolytic event on the loop connecting the first transmembrane helix (TMH) of Parl to the 6-TMH catalytic rhomboid domain of the protease. This cleavage disrupts the '1+6' structure that defines every mitochondrial rhomboid and generates a new form of Parl, PROD (Parl-rhomboid-domain). Structure-function analysis of Parl suggests that γ-cleavage could be implicated in eliminating Parl proteolytic activity, and structural modeling of PROD reveals structural conservation with the bacterial rhomboid GlpG. However, unlike bacterial rhomboids, which employ a diad-based mechanism of catalysis, Parl appears to use a conserved mitochondrial rhomboid-specific Asp residue on TMH-5 in a triad-based mechanism of catalysis. This work provides unexpected insights into the structural determinants regulating Parl stability and activity in vivo, and reveals a complex cascade of proteolytic events controlling the function of the protease in the mitochondrion.

Molecular genetics has linked mitochondrial dysfunction to the pathogenesis of Parkinson's disease by the discovery of rare, inherited mutations in gene products that associate with the mitochondria. Mutations in PTEN-induced kinase-1 (PINK1), which encodes a mitochondrial kinase, and PARKIN, encoding an E3 ubiquitin ligase, are the most frequent causes of recessive Parkinson's disease. Recent functional studies have revealed that PINK1 recruits PARKIN to mitochondria to initiate mitophagy, an important autophagic quality control mechanism that rids the cell of damaged mitochondria. PINK1 is post-translationally processed into a cleaved form whose levels are tightly regulated, although the significance of this processing is unknown. Here we demonstrate that the mitochondrial protease presenilin-associated rhomboid-like (PARL) can affect the proteolytic processing of PINK1 and that normal PINK1 localization and stability requires PARL's catalytic activity. PARL deficiency impairs PARKIN recruitment to mitochondria, suggesting PINK1's processing and localization are important in determining its interaction with PARKIN. We sequenced the PARL gene in Parkinson's disease patients and discovered a novel missense mutation in a functional domain of PARL's N-terminus. This PARL mutant is not sufficient to rescue PARKIN recruitment, suggesting that impaired mitophagy may be an underlying mechanism of disease pathogenesis in patients with PARL mutations.

Multiple factors promote insulin resistance. In this study, we evaluated the mRNA levels of presenilins-associated rhomboid-like protein (PARL) and mitochondrial content and enzyme activity from skeletal muscle isolated from insulin-resistant rats. Rats fed a high-fat diet for 35 days developed moderate insulin resistance, which was determined by an increase in plasma glucose and insulin concentrations following an oral glucose tolerance test. The PARL mRNA level was lower in the insulin-resistant rats than in control animals, and is associated with low mitochondrial content and reduced mitochondrial enzyme activity in the skeletal muscle from the insulin-resistant rats. The results suggest that high-fat-diet-induced insulin resistance is associated with mitochondrial dysfunction in skeletal muscle, and may be the result of the decreased expression of the PARL gene, which encodes the protein with functional significance in mitochondria.
