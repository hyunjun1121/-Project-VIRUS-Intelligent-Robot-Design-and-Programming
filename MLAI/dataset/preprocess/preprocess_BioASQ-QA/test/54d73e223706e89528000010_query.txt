This study evaluates the cost-effectiveness of 5-aminolevulinic acid (5-ALA, Gliolan®) in patients undergoing surgery for malignant glioma, in standard clinical practice conditions in Spain. Cost-effectiveness ratios were determined in terms of incremental cost per complete resection (CR) and incremental cost per additional quality-adjusted life year (QALY), based on data collected in the VISIONA observational study. Incremental cost with 5-ALA versus conventional surgery using white light only amounts to € 4550 per additional CR achieved and € 9021 per QALY gained. A sensitivity analysis shows these results to be robust. Malignant glioma surgery guided by 5-ALA fluorescence entails a moderate increase in hospital costs compared to current surgical practice and can be considered a cost-effective innovation.

Malignant gliomas remain associated with a poor prognosis despite both surgical treatment and radiochemotherapy.Previous studies have shown that complete resection of contrast-enhancing tumours is achieved in less than 20-30% of patients. 5-aminolevulinic acid (5-ALA) is a pro-drug that leads to accumulation of fluorescent protoporphyrins in malignant gliomas. The fluorescence can be visualized intraoperatively by use of a modified microscope. The Department of Neurosurgery at Aalborg Hospital has recently adopted this new technique as the first centre in Denmark. Our preliminary results are presented as a retrospective case series. All patients who had undergone 5-ALA fluorescence-guided surgery due to suspected malignant glioma were included. Patients received a standard preoperative dose of Gliolan. All patients had a postoperative cerebral magnetic resonance imaging scan done within 72 hours to determine their postoperative resection status. To date, 13 patients have undergone fluorescence-guided surgery. Total resection was achieved in 54-70% of the patients depending on the inclusion criteria. Total or near total resection was achieved in 92% of patients. The small numbers in our case series do not allow for direct comparison to be made, but show that our results on postoperative resection status fall within the range reported in other studies on the efficacy of 5-ALA. The literature offers mounting evidence in support of the role of aggressive cytoreductive surgery in patients with malignant gliomas. not relevant. not relevant.

ALA-induced protoporphyrin IX (PpIX) is used for fluorescence diagnosis (ALA-FD) and for fluorescence-guided resection of both (pre)malignant and non-malignant diseases. ALA is also applied in photodynamic therapy (ALA-PDT) of superficial (pre)malignant lesions in dermatology, urology, neurosurgery, otorhinolaryngology, gynecology and gastroenterology. Today, ALA is approved as Levulan for actinic keratoses, the ALA-methyl ester Metvix for actinic keratoses and basal cell carcinoma, the ALA-hexyl ester Hexvix for the diagnosis of bladder cancer and Gliolan for malignant glioma. The use of ALA for PDT and FD was established around 25 years ago, with most of the fundamental knowledge gained at the "bench" and implemented at the "bedside" due to the diligence of a few researchers within the first 10 years of research. After 1993 ALA research was taken up by many groups. For patient treatment, several factors are relevant. Administered mainly in a topical or oral form, ALA penetrates tissue in a sub-optimal way, which is currently improved by special techniques and the use of ALA-esters. PpIX accumulation is elevated in many malignant tissues, several tissue abnormalities, and in mucosa. It is also found at elevated levels in macrophages, dendritic cells and activated lymphocytes. Following sufficient PpIX accumulation in the target cells, irradiation is carried out which may be accompanied by a burning sensation at the treatment site. Due to a saturation process of PpIX formation and rapid photobleaching during irradiation the risk of overtreatment is relatively low. Pharmacokinetical studies have demonstrated a low systemic photosensitivity and excretion of PpIX via natural routes.

Five-aminolevulinic acid (Gliolan, medac, Wedel, Germany, 5-ALA) is approved for fluorescence-guided resections of adult malignant gliomas. Case reports indicate that 5-ALA can be used for children, yet no prospective study has been conducted as of yet. As a basis for a study, we conducted a survey among certified European Gliolan users to collect data on their experiences with children. Information on patient characteristics, MRI characteristics of tumors, histology, fluorescence qualities, and outcomes were requested. Surgeons were further asked to indicate whether fluorescence was "useful", i.e., leading to changes in surgical strategy or identification of residual tumor. Recursive partitioning analysis (RPA) was used for defining cohorts with high or low likelihoods for useful fluorescence. Data on 78 patients <18 years of age were submitted by 20 centers. Fluorescence was found useful in 12 of 14 glioblastomas (85 %), four of five anaplastic astrocytomas (60 %), and eight of ten ependymomas grades II and III (80 %). Fluorescence was found inconsistently useful in PNETs (three of seven; 43 %), gangliogliomas (two of five; 40 %), medulloblastomas (two of eight, 25 %) and pilocytic astrocytomas (two of 13; 15 %). RPA of pre-operative factors showed tumors with supratentorial location, strong contrast enhancement and first operation to have a likelihood of useful fluorescence of 64.3 %, as opposed to infratentorial tumors with first surgery (23.1 %). Our survey demonstrates 5-ALA as being used in pediatric brain tumors. 5-ALA may be especially useful for contrast-enhancing supratentorial tumors. These data indicate controlled studies to be necessary and also provide a basis for planning such a study.

To assess effectiveness of 5-aminolevulinic acid (5-ALA, Gliolan(®)) in patients treated for malignant glioma under typical daily practice conditions in Spain, using complete resection rate (CR) and progression free survival at 6 months (PFS6). Retrospective review of data from 18 neurosurgery departments that were categorised as either using or not using 5-ALA. The study included adult patients with suspected malignant gliomas for whom the intended treatment plan included complete resection followed by radiotherapy and chemotherapy with temozolomide. Postoperative MRI and clinical data representing at least 6 months were required for inclusion. Rates of CR and PFS6 were compared between patients with 5-ALA treatment and those without. The study included 251 evaluable cases. CR and PFS6 rates were significantly higher in the group of patients treated surgically with 5-ALA: CR, 67% versus 45%, p=.000; PFS6 for patients with grade IV tumours, 69% versus 48%; p=.002. The differences retained their significance and magnitude after adjusting for all covariates including age, functional status, and whether gliomas were located in eloquent areas. In this retrospective series, use of 5-ALA during habitual surgical procedures in Spain was associated with a higher complete resection rate for malignant glioma and increased PFS6 for grade iv glioma.
