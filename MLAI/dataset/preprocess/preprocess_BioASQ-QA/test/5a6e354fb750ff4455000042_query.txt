Which R/bioconductor package has been developed to aid in epigenomic analysis?

[PMID: 28334349]
While large amounts of epigenomic data are publicly available, their retrieval in a form suitable for downstream analysis is a bottleneck in current research. The DeepBlue Epigenomic Data Server provides a powerful interface and API for filtering, transforming, aggregating and downloading data from several epigenomic consortia. To make public epigenomic data conveniently available for analysis in R, we developed an R/Bioconductor package that connects to the DeepBlue Epigenomic Data Server, enabling users to quickly gather and transform epigenomic data from selected experiments for analysis in the Bioconductor ecosystem. http://deepblue.mpi-inf.mpg.de/R .
