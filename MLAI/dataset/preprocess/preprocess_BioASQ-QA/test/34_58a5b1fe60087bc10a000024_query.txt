Whether NF-κB promoter transactivation by the human T-cell leukemia virus type 1 (HTLV-1) Tax protein requires Tax SUMOylation is still a matter of debate. In this study, we revisited the role of Tax SUMOylation using a strategy based on the targeting of Ubc9, the unique E2 SUMO-conjugating enzyme. We show that either a catalytically inactive form of Ubc9 (Ubc9-C93S) or Ubc9 small interfering RNA (siRNA) dramatically reduces Tax conjugation to endogenous SUMO-1 or SUMO-2/3, demonstrating that as expected, Tax SUMOylation is under the control of the catalytic activity of Ubc9. We further report that a non-SUMOylated Tax protein produced in 293T cells is still able to activate either a transfected or an integrated NF-κB reporter promoter and to induce expression of an NF-κB-regulated endogenous gene. Importantly, blocking Ubc9 activity in T cells also results in the production of a non-SUMOylated Tax that is still fully functional for the activation of a NF-κB promoter. These results provide the definitive evidence that Tax SUMOylation is not required for NF-κB-driven gene induction. Human T-cell leukemia virus type 1 is able to transform CD4(+) T lymphocytes. The viral oncoprotein Tax plays a key role in this process by promoting cell proliferation and survival, mainly through permanent activation of the NF-κB pathway. Elucidating the molecular mechanisms involved in NF-κB pathway activation by Tax is therefore a key issue to understand HTLV-1-mediated transformation. Tax SUMOylation was initially proposed to be critical for Tax-induced NF-κB promoter activation, which was challenged by our later observation that a low-level-SUMOylated Tax mutant was still functional for activation of NF-κB promoters. To clarify the role of Tax SUMOylation, we set up a new approach based on the inhibition of the SUMOylation machinery in Tax-expressing cells. We show that blocking the SUMO-conjugating enzyme Ubc9 abolishes Tax SUMOylation and that a non-SUMOylated Tax still activates NF-κB promoters in either adherent cells or T cells.

Small ubiquitin-like modifier (SUMO1-3) constitutes a group of proteins that conjugate to lysine residues of target proteins thereby modifying their activity, stability, and subcellular localization. A large number of SUMO target proteins are transcription factors and other nuclear proteins involved in gene expression. Furthermore, SUMO conjugation plays key roles in genome stability, quality control of newly synthesized proteins, proteasomal degradation of proteins, and DNA damage repair. Any marked increase in levels of SUMO-conjugated proteins is therefore expected to have a major impact on the fate of cells. We show here that SUMO conjugation is activated in human astrocytic brain tumors. Levels of both SUMO1- and SUMO2/3-conjugated proteins were markedly increased in tumor samples. The effect was least pronounced in low-grade astrocytoma (WHO Grade II) and most pronounced in glioblastoma multiforme (WHO Grade IV). We also found a marked rise in levels of Ubc9, the only SUMO conjugation enzyme identified so far. Blocking SUMO1-3 conjugation in glioblastoma cells by silencing their expression blocked DNA synthesis, cell growth, and clonogenic survival of cells. It also resulted in DNA-dependent protein kinase-induced phosphorylation of H2AX, indicative of DNA double-strand damage, and G(2) /M cell cycle arrest. Collectively, these findings highlight the pivotal role of SUMO conjugation in DNA damage repair processes and imply that the SUMO conjugation pathway could be a new target of therapeutic intervention aimed at increasing the sensitivity of glioblastomas to radiotherapy and chemotherapy.

Sumoylation plays important roles in the modulation of protein function, neurotransmission and plasticity, but the mechanisms regulating this post-translational system in neurons remain largely unknown. Here we demonstrate that the synaptic diffusion of Ubc9, the sole conjugating enzyme of the sumoylation pathway, is regulated by synaptic activity. We use restricted photobleaching/photoconversion of individual hippocampal spines to measure the diffusion properties of Ubc9 and show that it is regulated through an mGlu5R-dependent signalling pathway. Increasing synaptic activity with a GABAA receptor antagonist or directly activating mGlu5R increases the synaptic residency time of Ubc9 via a Gαq/PLC/Ca(2+)/PKC cascade. This activation promotes a transient synaptic trapping of Ubc9 through a PKC phosphorylation-dependent increase of Ubc9 recognition to phosphorylated substrates and consequently leads to the modulation of synaptic sumoylation. Our data demonstrate that Ubc9 diffusion is subject to activity-dependent regulatory processes and provide a mechanism for the dynamic changes in sumoylation occurring during synaptic transmission.

Small ubiquitin-like modifiers (SUMO) conjugate to target proteins in a dynamic, reversible manner to function as post-translational modifiers. SUMOylation of target proteins can impinge on their localization, in addition to their activity or stability. Differential expression of deSUMOylating enzymes (SENP 1 and 2) contributes to altered mammalian placental development and function in mice. Severe preeclampsia (sPE) is associated with abnormal placental development and chronic ischemic injury. Extra- and intracellular stimuli/stressors that include hypoxic-activated pathways are known modulators of SUMOylation. In this current study we hypothesized that placentas from sPE patients will display up regulation in the SUMO regulatory pathway. Utilizing qRT-PCR, immuno-blotting and Western techniques, we determined the expression levels of SUMO pathway genes in healthy and diseased placentas. We also exposed placental explants to hypoxia to study the effect on the SUMOylation pathway. We observed steady-state expression of SUMO1-3, SUMO-conjugated enzyme-UBC9 and deSUMOylating enzymes - SENPs, throughout normal gestation. An elevated level of free SUMO1-3 and SUMO-protein conjugates was observed in sPE placentas. Furthermore, placental UBC9 levels were strikingly increased in the same sPE patients. Hypoxia-induced SUMOylation in first trimester placental explants. Our data demonstrate an elevated steady-state of SUMOylation in sPE placentas compared with gestational aged-matched controls. The observed hyper-SUMOylation in sPE placentas correlates with elevated expression of UBC9 rather than with reduced expression of SENPs Hypoxia may contribute to alterations in placental SUMOylation pathway. Increased placental SUMOylation may contribute to the pathogenesis of serious placental pathology that causes extreme preterm birth.

Sumoylation and ubiquitinylation reversibly regulate the activity of transcription factors through covalent attachment to lysine residues of target proteins. We examined whether the Ets-1 transcription factor is modified by sumoylation and/or ubiquitinylation. Among four potential SUMO motifs in Ets-1, we identified lysines 15 and 227 within the LK(15)YE and IK(227)QE motifs, as being the sumoylation acceptor sites. Using transfection of Ets-1 wildtype (WT) or its sumoylation deficient version (Ets-1 K15R/K227R), as well as WT or mutant proteins of the SUMO pathway, we further demonstrated that the E2 SUMO-conjugating enzyme Ubc9 and a E3 SUMO ligase, PIASy, can enhance Ets-1 sumoylation, while a SUMO protease, SENP1, can desumoylate Ets-1. We also found that Ets-1 is modified by K48-linked polyubiquitinylation independently of the sumoylation acceptor sites and is degraded through the 26S proteasome pathway, while sumoylation of Ets-1 does not affect its stability. Finally, sumoylation of Ets-1 leads to reduced transactivation and we demonstrated that previously identified critical lysine residues in Synergistic Control motifs are the sumoylation acceptor sites of Ets-1. These data show that Ets-1 can be modified by sumoylation and/or ubiquitinylation, with sumoylation repressing transcriptional activity of Ets-1 and having no clear antagonistic action on the ubiquitin-proteasome degradation pathway.

Here we have identified host cell proteins involved with the cellular SUMOylation pathway, SUMO-1 (small ubiquitin-like modifier) and UBC9, a SUMO-1 conjugating enzyme that interact with classical swine fever virus (CSFV) Core protein. Five highly conserved lysine residues (K179, K180, K220, K221, and K246) within the CSFV Core were identified as putative SUMOylation sites. Analysis of these interactions showed that K179A, K180A, and K221A substitutions disrupt Core-SUMO-1 binding, while K220A substitution precludes Core-UBC9 binding. In vivo, Core mutant viruses (K179A, K180A, K220A, K221A) and (K220A, K221A) harboring those substitutions were attenuated in swine. These data shows a clear correlation between the disruption of Core protein binding to SUMO-1 and UBC9 and CSFV attenuation. Overall, these data suggest that the interaction of Core with the cellular SUMOylation pathway plays a significant role in the CSFV growth cycle in vivo.

Epithelial ovarian cancer (EOC) is one of the leading causes of cancer deaths in women worldwide. Ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme 9 (Ubc9), the sole conjugating enzyme for sumoylation, regulates protein function and plays an important role in sumoylation-mediated cellular pathways. Although sumoylation plays a key role in DNA repair and tumorgenesis, whether Ubc9 is involved in EOC progression remains unknown. In the present study, we constructed Ubc-9 expressed recombined plasmid pEGFP-N1-Ubc9. The mRNA levels of Ubc9 were confirmed in human ovarian cell lines before and after transfection with pEGFP-N1-Ubc9 or small interfering RNA (siRNA) targeted Ubc9 by real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR). The MTT (3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide) assay was used to observe the effect of Ubc9 on cell proliferation. The protein levels of Ubc9, and proliferation-related signals Akt and physphorylated Akt were determined by Western blot. Our results showed that proliferation of EOC cells increased significantly in Ubc9 overexpressing cells, but decreased in Ubc9 knockdown cells. The physphorylation of Akt showed similar trends. In addition, the inhibitor of PI3K/Akt signaling pathway, LY294002, dramatically inhibited the growth of Ubc9 overexpressing cells. Therefore, Ubc9 gene plays an important role in cell proliferation in EOC through PI3K/Akt signaling pathway.

A primary step in activating the alternative nuclear factor-kappaB (NF-kappaB) pathway requires NF-kappaB2/p100 processing to generate p52. In most cases, stimuli-induced p100 processing is dependent on NF-kappaB-inducing kinase/IkappaB kinase alpha-mediated phosphorylation and ubiquitination. Here, we report that post-translational modification of p100 at specific sites by the small ubiquitin-like modifier (SUMO) is another determining factor for stimuli-induced p100 processing. The results show that basal SUMO modification is required for stimuli-induced p100 phosphorylation and that blocking SUMOylation of p100, either by site-directed mutation or by short interfering RNA-targeted diminution of E2 SUMO-conjugating enzyme Ubc9, inhibits various physiological stimuli-induced p100 processing and ultimate activation of the alternative NF-kappaB pathway. Together, these findings show the crucial role of SUMO1 modification in p100 processing and provide mechanistic insights into the participation of SUMO1 modification in the regulation of signal transduction.

In astrocytes, the inflammatory induction of Nitric Oxide Synthase type 2 (NOS2) is inhibited by noradrenaline (NA) at the transcriptional level however its effects on specific transcription factors are not fully known. Recent studies show that the activity of several transcription factors including C/EBPbeta, which is needed for maximal NOS2 expression, is modulated by conjugation of the small molecular weight protein SUMO. We examined whether the expression of SUMO Related Genes (SRGs: SUMO-1, the conjugating enzyme Ubc9, and the protease SENP1) are affected by inflammatory conditions or NA and whether SUMO-1 regulates NOS2 through interaction with C/EBPbeta. Bacterial endotoxin lipopolysaccharide (LPS) was used to induce inflammatory responses including NOS2 expression in primary astrocytes. The mRNA levels of SRGs were determined by QPCR. A functional role for SUMOylation was evaluated by determining effects of over-expressing SRGs on NOS2 promoter and NFkappaB binding-element reporter constructs. Interactions of SUMO-1 and C/EBPbeta with the NOS2 promoter were examined by chromatin immunoprecipitation assays. Interactions of SUMO-1 with C/EBPbeta were examined by immunoprecipitation and Western blot analysis and by fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) assays. LPS decreased mRNA levels of SUMO-1, Ubc9 and SENP1 in primary astrocytes and a similar decrease occurred during normal aging in brain. NA attenuated the LPS-induced reductions and increased SUMO-1 above basal levels. Over-expression of SUMO-1, Ubc9, or SENP1 reduced the activation of a NOS2 promoter, whereas activation of a 4 x NFkappaB binding-element reporter was only reduced by SUMO-1. ChIP studies revealed interactions of SUMO-1 and C/EBPbeta with C/EBP binding sites on the NOS2 promoter that were modulated by LPS and NA. SUMO-1 co-precipitated with C/EBPbeta and a close proximity was confirmed by FRET analysis. Our results demonstrate that SUMOylation regulates NOS2 expression in astrocytes, and point to modification of C/EBPbeta as a possible mechanism of action. Targeting the SUMOylation pathway may therefore offer a novel means to regulate inflammatory NOS2 expression in neurological conditions and diseases.

Sumoylation regulates a wide range of cellular processes. However, little is known about the regulation of the SUMO machinery. In this study, we demonstrate that two lysine residues (Lys-153 and Lys-157) in the C-terminal region of the yeast E2-conjugating enzyme Ubc9 are the major and minor autosumoylation sites, respectively. Surprisingly, mutation of Lys-157 (ubc9(K157R)) significantly stimulates the level of Ubc9 autosumoylation at Lys-153. The functional role of Ubc9 autosumoylation is exemplified in our findings that cell cycle-dependent sumoylation of cytoskeletal septin proteins is inversely correlated with the Ubc9 autosumoylation level and that mutation of the Ubc9 autosumoylation sites results in aberrant cell morphology. Our study elucidates a regulatory mechanism that utilizes automodification of the E2 enzyme of the sumoylation machinery to control substrate sumoylation.

One aspect of brain death is cardiovascular deregulation because asystole invariably occurs shortly after its diagnosis. A suitable neural substrate for mechanistic delineation of this aspect of brain death resides in the rostral ventrolateral medulla (RVLM). RVLM is the origin of a life-and-death signal that our laboratory detected from blood pressure of comatose patients that disappears before brain death ensues. At the same time, transcriptional upregulation of heme oxygenase-1 in RVLM by hypoxia-inducible factor-1α (HIF-1α) plays a pro-life role in experimental brain death, and HIF-1α is subject to sumoylation activated by transient cerebral ischemia. It follows that sumoylation of HIF-1α in RVLM in response to hypoxia may play a modulatory role on brain stem cardiovascular regulation during experimental brain death. A clinically relevant animal model that employed mevinphos as the experimental insult in Sprague-Dawley rat was used. Biochemical changes in RVLM during distinct phenotypes in systemic arterial pressure spectrum that reflect maintained or defunct brain stem cardiovascular regulation were studied. Western blot analysis, EMSA, ELISA, confocal microscopy and immunoprecipitation demonstrated that drastic tissue hypoxia, elevated levels of proteins conjugated by small ubiquitin-related modifier-1 (SUMO-1), Ubc9 (the only known conjugating enzyme for the sumoylation pathway) or HIF-1α, augmented sumoylation of HIF-1α, nucleus-bound translocation and enhanced transcriptional activity of HIF-1α in RVLM neurons took place preferentially during the pro-life phase of experimental brain death. Furthermore, loss-of-function manipulations by immunoneutralization of SUMO-1, Ubc9 or HIF-1α in RVLM blunted the upregulated nitric oxide synthase I/protein kinase G signaling cascade, which sustains the brain stem cardiovascular regulatory machinery during the pro-life phase. We conclude that sumoylation of HIF-1α in RVLM ameliorates brain stem cardiovascular regulatory failure during experimental brain death via upregulation of nitric oxide synthase I/protein kinase G signaling. This information should offer new therapeutic initiatives against this fatal eventuality.

Impairment of proteasomal function is pathogenic in several cardiac proteinopathies and can eventually lead to heart failure. Loss of proteasomal activity often results in the accumulation of large protein aggregates. The ubiquitin proteasome system (UPS) is primarily responsible for cellular protein degradation, and although the role of ubiquitination in this process is well studied, the function of an ancillary post-translational modification, SUMOylation, in protein quality control is not fully understood. To determine the role of ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme 9 (UBC9), a small ubiquitin-like modifier-conjugating enzyme, in cardiomyocyte protein quality control. Gain- and loss-of-function approaches were used to determine the importance of UBC9. Overexpression of UBC9 enhanced UPS function in cardiomyocytes, whereas knockdown of UBC9 by small interfering RNA caused significant accumulations of aggregated protein. UPS function and relative activity was analyzed using a UPS reporter protein consisting of a short degron, CL1, fused to the COOH-terminus of green fluorescent protein (GFPu). Subsequently, the effects of UBC9 on UPS function were tested in a proteotoxic model of desmin-related cardiomyopathy, caused by cardiomyocyte-specific expression of a mutated αB crystallin, CryAB(R120G). CryAB(R120G) expression leads to aggregate formation and decreased proteasomal function. Coinfection of UBC9-adenovirus with CryAB(R120G) virus reduced the proteotoxic sequelae, decreasing overall aggregate concentrations. Conversely, knockdown of UBC9 significantly decreased UPS function in the model and resulted in increased aggregate levels. UBC9 plays a significant role in cardiomyocyte protein quality control, and its activity can be exploited to reduce toxic levels of misfolded or aggregated proteins in cardiomyopathy.

Sumoylation, the covalent attachment of SUMO (Small Ubiquitin-Like Modifier) to proteins, differs from other Ubl (Ubiquitin-like) pathways. In sumoylation, E2 ligase Ubc9 can function without E3 enzymes, albeit with lower reaction efficiency. Here, we study the mechanism through which E3 ligase RanBP2 triggers target recognition and catalysis by E2 Ubc9. Two mechanisms were proposed for sumoylation. While in both the first step involves Ubc9 conjugation to SUMO, the subsequent sequence of events differs: in the first E2-SUMO forms a complex with the target and E3, followed by SUMO transfer to the target. In the second, Ubc9-SUMO binds to the target and facilitates SUMO transfer without E3. Using dynamic correlations obtained from explicit solvent molecular dynamic simulations we illustrate the key roles played by allostery in both mechanisms. Pre-existence of conformational states explains the experimental observations that sumoylation can occur without E3, even though at a reduced rate. Furthermore, we propose a mechanism for enhancement of sumoylation by E3. Analysis of the conformational ensembles of the complex of E2 conjugated to SUMO illustrates that the E2 enzyme is already largely pre-organized for target binding and catalysis; E3 binding shifts the equilibrium and enhances these pre-existing populations. We further observe that E3 binding regulates allosterically the key residues in E2, Ubc9 Asp100/Lys101 E2, for the target recognition.

The human papillomavirus oncogenic protein, E6, interacts with a number of cellular proteins, and for some targets, E6 directs their degradation through the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway. Post-translational modification with ubiquitin-like modifiers, such as SUMO, also influences protein activities, protein-protein interactions, and protein stability. We report that the high risk HPVE6 proteins reduce the intracellular quantity of the sole SUMO conjugation enzyme, Ubc9, concomitant with decreased host sumoylation. E6 did not significantly influence transcription of Ubc9, indicating that the effects were likely at the protein level. Consistent with typical E6-mediated proteasomal degradation, E6 bound to Ubc9 in vitro, and required E6AP for reduction of Ubc9 levels. Under stable E6 expression conditions in differentiating keratinocytes there was a decrease in Ubc9 and a loss of numerous sumoylated targets indicating a significant perturbation of the normal sumoylation profile. While E6 is known to inhibit PIASy, a SUMO ligase, our results suggest that HPV E6 also targets the Ubc9 protein to modulate host cell sumoylation, suggesting that the sumoylation system may be an important target during viral reproduction and possibly the subsequent development of cervical cancer.

As the sole E2 enzyme for SUMOylation, Ubc9 is predominantly nuclear. However, the underlying mechanisms of Ubc9 nuclear localization are still not well understood. Here we show that RNAi-depletion of Imp13, an importin known to mediate Ubc9 nuclear import, reduces both Ubc9 nuclear accumulation and global SUMOylation. Furthermore, Ubc9-R13A or Ubc9-H20D mutation previously shown to interrupt the interaction of Ubc9 with nucleus-enriched SUMOs reduces the nuclear enrichment of Ubc9, suggesting that the interaction of Ubc9 with the nuclear SUMOs may enhance Ubc9 nuclear retention. Moreover, Ubc9-R17E mutation, which is known to disrupt the interaction of Ubc9 with both SUMOs and Imp13, causes a greater decrease in Ubc9 nuclear accumulation than Ubc9-R13A or Ubc9-H20D mutation. Lastly, Ubc9-K74A/S89D mutations that perturb the interaction of Ubc9 with nucleus-enriched SUMOylation-consensus motifs has no effect on Ubc9 nuclear localization. Altogether, our results have elucidated that the amino acid residues within the N-terminal region of Ubc9 play a pivotal role in regulation of Ubc9 nuclear localization.

The cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) is generally responsible for the cAMP/PKA regulated anion conductance at the apical membranes of secretory epithelial cells. Mutations in CFTR underlie cystic fibrosis (CF), in which the most common variant, F508del, causes protein misfolding and its proteasome-mediated degradation. A new pathway that contributes to mutant CFTR degradation is mediated by the small heat shock protein, Hsp27, which cooperates with Ubc9, the E2 enzyme for SUMOylation, to selectively conjugate mutant CFTR with SUMO-2/3. This SUMO paralog can form polychains, which are recognized by the ubiquitin E3 enzyme, RNF4, leading to CFTR ubiquitylation and recognition by the proteasome. We found also that F508del CFTR could be modified by SUMO-1, a paralog that does not support SUMO polychain formation. The use of different SUMO paralogs to modify and target a single substrate for divergent purposes is not uncommon. In this short review we discuss the possibility that conjugation with SUMO-1 could protect mutant CFTR from disposal by RNF4 and similar ubiquitin ligases. We hypothesize that such a pathway could contribute to therapeutic efforts to stabilize immature mutant CFTR and thereby enhance the action of therapeutics that correct CFTR trafficking to the apical membranes.

Small ubiquitin-like modifier (SUMO) participates in a reversible posttranslational modification process (SUMOylation) that regulates a wide variety of cellular processes and plays important roles for numerous viruses during infection. However, the roles of viral protein SUMOylation in dengue virus (DENV) infection have not been elucidated. In this study, we found that the SUMOylation pathway was involved in the DENV life cycle, since DENV replication was reduced by silencing the cellular gene Ubc9, which encodes the sole E2-conjugating enzyme required for SUMOylation. By in vivo and in vitro SUMOylation assays, the DENV NS5 protein was identified as an authentic SUMO-targeted protein. By expressing various NS5 mutants, we found that the SUMO acceptor sites are located in the N-terminal domain of NS5 and that a putative SUMO-interacting motif (SIM) of this domain is crucial for its SUMOylation. A DENV replicon harboring the SUMOylation-defective SIM mutant showed a severe defect in viral RNA replication, supporting the notion that NS5 SUMOylation is required for DENV replication. SUMOylation-defective mutants also failed to suppress the induction of STAT2-mediated host antiviral interferon signaling. Furthermore, the SUMOylation of NS5 significantly increased the stability of NS5 protein, which could account for most of the biological functions of SUMOylated NS5. Collectively, these findings suggest that the SUMOylation of DENV NS5 is one of the mechanisms regulating DENV replication. SUMOylation is a common posttranslational modification that regulates cellular protein functions but has not been reported in the proteins of dengue virus. Here, we found that the replicase of DENV, nonstructural protein 5 (NS5), can be SUMOylated. It is well known that providing RNA-dependent RNA polymerase activity and antagonizing host antiviral IFN signaling are a "double indemnity" of NS5 to support DENV replication. Without SUMOylation, NS5 fails to maintain its protein stability, which consequently disrupts its function in viral RNA replication and innate immunity antagonism. DENV threatens billions of people worldwide, but no licensed vaccine or specific therapeutics are currently available. Thus, our findings suggest that rather than specifically targeting NS5 enzyme activity, NS5 protein stability is a novel drug target on the growing list of anti-DENV strategies.

Successful viruses have evolved superior strategies to escape host defenses or exploit host biological pathways. Most of the viral immediate-early (ie) genes are essential for viral infection and depend solely on host proteins; however, the molecular mechanisms are poorly understood. In this study, we focused on the modification of viral IE proteins by the crayfish small ubiquitin-related modifier (SUMO) and investigated the role of SUMOylation during the viral life cycle. SUMO and SUMO ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme 9 (UBC9) involved in SUMOylation were identified in red swamp crayfish (Procambarus clarkii). Both SUMO and UBC9 were upregulated in crayfish challenged with white spot syndrome virus (WSSV). Replication of WSSV genes increased in crayfish injected with recombinant SUMO or UBC9, but injection of mutant SUMO or UBC9 protein had no effect. Subsequently, we analyzed the mechanism by which crayfish SUMOylation facilitates WSSV replication. Crayfish UBC9 bound to all three WSSV IE proteins tested, and one of these IE proteins (WSV051) was covalently modified by SUMO in vitro. The expression of viral ie genes was affected and that of late genes was significantly inhibited in UBC9-silenced or SUMO-silenced crayfish, and the inhibition effect was rescued by injection of recombinant SUMO or UBC9. The results of this study demonstrate that viral IE proteins can be modified by crayfish SUMOylation, prompt the expression of viral genes, and ultimately benefit WSSV replication. Understanding of the mechanisms by which viruses exploit host components will greatly improve our knowledge of the virus-host "arms race" and contribute to the development of novel methods against virulent viruses.

RAP80, a nuclear protein with two functional ubiquitin-interaction motifs (UIMs) at its N-terminus, plays a critical role in the regulation of estrogen receptor alpha and DNA damage response signaling. A yeast two-hybrid screen identified the SUMO-conjugating enzyme UBC9 as a protein interacting with RAP80. The interaction of RAP80 with UBC9 was confirmed by co-immunoprecipitation and GST pull-down analyses. The region between aa 122-204 was critical for the interaction of RAP80 with UBC9. In addition, we demonstrate that RAP80 is a target for SUMO-1 modification in intact cells. Expression of UBC9 enhanced RAP80 mono-sumoylation and also induced multi-sumoylation of RAP80. In addition to SUMO-1, RAP80 was efficiently conjugated to SUMO-3 but was only a weak substrate for SUMO-2 conjugation. These findings suggest that sumoylation plays a role in the regulation of RAP80 functions.

To explore the hypoxic regulation of sumoylation pathways and cell viability in nucleus pulposus (NP) and annulus fibrosus (AF) cells. Expression of small ubiquitin-like modifier (SUMO) molecules, SUMO E1 activating enzymes SAE1 and SAE2, SUMO E2 conjugating enzyme UBC9, and de-sumoylation enzyme sentrin/SUMO-specific proteases (SENP)1 was immunolocalized in rat intervertebral disc (IVD) cells. NP and AF cells were cultured in hypoxia and cell viability was evaluated by quantifying cell proliferation, cellular senescence, apoptosis, and cell cycle distribution. Hypoxic regulation of sumoylation pathways was studied by analyzing the transcription and expression of SUMO molecules and sumoylation enzymes. Loss of function study using SENP1 siRNA was performed to investigate the regulatory role of sumoylation on the function of hypoxia inducible factor 1α (HIF-1α) and the hypoxic tolerance of IVD cells. Sumoylation pathways were expressed in IVD cells and localized predominantly in nuclei. Both NP and AF cells maintained viability under hypoxia and upregulated the expression of SENP1. In NP cells hypoxia transiently increased the expression of SUMO-1, SUMO-2/3, SAE2, and UBC9, whereas SUMO-1 was elevated while SUMO-2/3, SAE1, SAE2, and UBC9 were reduced by low oxygen tensions in AF cells. Although downregulation of SENP1 decreased the transcriptional activity of HIF-1α, the viability of disc cells showed no significant loss under hypoxia. NP and AF cells equally tolerate oxygen deficiency, but differently regulate the sumoylation pathways under hypoxia. The distinct sumoylation dynamics may help extend our understanding of the cell-specific regulation of the molecular basis that promotes cell survival in the hypoxic IVD.

Lung cancer is the leading cause of cancer-related mortality worldwide. The mortality is high mainly due to the lack of known effective screening procedures; there is a high tendency for early spread and systemic therapies do not cure metastatic disease. Thus, it is important to investigate the molecular mechanism(s) of lung cancer development and, specifically, to identify an effective method by which to inhibit the invasion and metastasis of lung cancer. Ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme 9 (Ubc9), the sole conjugating enzyme for sumoylation, regulates protein function and plays a key role in tumorigenesis. Whether Ubc9 is involved in the invasion and metastasis of lung cancer remains unknown. Herein, we report that Ubc9 exhibits an important role in lung cancer invasion and metastasis. We first investigated the biological effect of Ubc9 on lung cancer by cloning the Ubc9 gene into a eukaryotic expression plasmid and stably expressing it in the human small cell lung cancer cell line NCI-H446 in order to observe any biological changes. We further analyzed the effect of Ubc9 in an in vivo experiment, injecting NCI-H446 cells stably overexpressing Ubc9 into nude mice and analyzing their metastatic ability. Our results demonstrated that Ubc9 is expressed at higher levels in primary lung cancer tissue and metastatic nodules as compared to premalignant and/or normal tissue. Furthermore, we demonstrated that upregulation of Ubc9 expression promotes migration and invasion. Ubc9 likely plays an important role in cancer progression by promoting invasion and metastasis in lung cancer.

Tec1 is a transcription factor in the yeast mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathway that controls invasive growth. Previously we reported that a fraction of Tec1 protein is sumoylated on residue lysine 54 in normally growing cells. Here we describe regulation and functional consequences of Tec1 sumoylation. We found that activation of Kss1, the MAPK that directly activates Tec1, results in a decrease in Tec1 sumoylation and a concurrent increase of Tec1 transcriptional activity. Consistent with a role of sumoylation in inhibiting Tec1 activity, specifically increasing sumoylation of Tec1 by fusing it to the sumoylating enzyme Ubc9 leads to a dramatic decrease of Tec1 transcriptional activity. Invasive growth is also compromised in Tec1-Ubc9. In contrast, fusing sumoylation-site mutant Tec1, i.e., Tec1(K54R), to Ubc9 did not significantly alter transcriptional activation and had a less effect on invasive growth. Taken together, these findings provide evidence for regulated sumoylation as a mechanism to modulate the activity of Tec1 and validate Ubc9 fusion-directed sumoylation as a useful approach for studying protein sumoylation.

It has been reported that ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme 9 (Ubc9), the unique enzyme2 in the sumoylation pathway, is up-regulated in many cancers. However, the expression and regulation of UBC9 in glioma remains unknown. In this study, we found that Ubc9 was up-regulated in glioma tissues and cell lines compared to a normal control. UBC9 knockdown by small interfering RNA (siRNA) affected cell proliferation and apoptosis in T98G cells. Further experiments revealed that microRNA (miR)-214 directly targeted the 3' untranslated region (UTR) of UBC9 and that there was an inverse relationship between the expression levels of miR-214 and UBC9 protein in glioma tissues and cells. miR-214 overexpression suppressed the endogenous UBC9 protein and affected T98G cell proliferation. These findings suggest that miR-214 reduction facilitates UBC9 expression and is involved in the regulation of glioma cell proliferation.

The small ubiquitin-like modifier (SUMO) pathway in eukaryotes is an essential post-translational modification required for a variety of cellular processes, development and organelle biogenesis. SUMO-conjugating enzyme (Ubc9) is an important conjunction enzyme in the SUMO pathway. SUMO-1 and Ubc9 have been found in vertebrates; however, their expression in crustaceans was poorly characterized. In this study, the SUMO-1 and Ubc9 genes were identified in the developing testis and ovary of Chinese mitten crab, Eriocheir sinensis, and designated EsSUMO-1 and EsUbc9, respectively. Quantitative real-time PCR demonstrated the expression level of both mRNAs varied significantly during testis and ovary development. In the testis, EsSUMO-1 and EsUbc9 were expressed at moderate levels in stage II-1, increased at stage II-2, and then gradually declined in stage IV. In the ovary, EsSUMO-1 and EsUbc9 expression were low in the early stage, reach the highest level at stage III-2, and then gradually decreased in stage IV. Transcripts from both genes were detected using in situ hybridization throughout the testis and ovary, in the spermatids and oocytes. The pattern of EsSUMO-1 and EsUbc9 expression in the testis and ovary suggests that SUMOylation may play an important role in spermatogenesis and oogenesis in E. sinensis.

Global sumoylation, SUMO chain formation, and genome stabilization are all outputs generated by a limited repertoire of enzymes. Mechanisms driving selectivity for each of these processes are largely uncharacterized. Here, through crystallographic analyses we show that the SUMO E2 Ubc9 forms a noncovalent complex with a SUMO-like domain of Rad60 (SLD2). Ubc9:SLD2 and Ubc9:SUMO noncovalent complexes are structurally analogous, suggesting that differential recruitment of Ubc9 by SUMO or Rad60 provides a novel means for such selectivity. Indeed, deconvoluting Ubc9 function by disrupting either the Ubc9:SLD2 or Ubc9:SUMO noncovalent complex reveals distinct roles in facilitating sumoylation. Ubc9:SLD2 acts in the Nse2 SUMO E3 ligase-dependent pathway for DNA repair, whereas Ubc9:SUMO instead promotes global sumoylation and chain formation, via the Pli1 E3 SUMO ligase. Moreover, this Pli1-dependent SUMO chain formation causes the genome instability phenotypes of SUMO-targeted ubiquitin ligase (STUbL) mutants. Overall, we determine that, unexpectedly, Ubc9 noncovalent partner choice dictates the role of sumoylation in distinct cellular pathways.

The SUMO pathway parallels the classical ubiquitinylation pathway with three discrete steps: activation involving the enzyme E1, conjugation involving the E2 enzyme UBC9, and substrate modification through the cooperative association of UBC9 and E3 ligases. We report here that the adenoviral protein Gam1 inhibits the SUMO pathway by interfering with the activity of E1 (SAE1/SAE2). In vivo, Gam1 expression leads to SAE1/SAE2 inactivation, both SAE1/SAE2 and UBC9 disappearance, and overall inhibition of protein sumoylation. This results in transcriptional activation of some promoters and is directly linked to inhibition of sumoylation of the transcriptional activators involved. Our results identify a mechanism for interfering with the SUMO pathway and with transcription that could have an impact in the design of novel pharmaceutical agents. They also point out once again to the extraordinary ability of eukaryotic viruses to interfere with the biology of host cells by targeting fundamental biochemical processes.

The activity of the p53 tumor suppressor protein and the c-Jun protooncogene is regulated by posttranslational modifications, such as phosphorylation or ubiquitination. In addition, covalent attachment of the ubiquitin-like modifier SUMO appears to modulate their transcriptional activity. Sumoylation proceeds via an enzymatic pathway that is mechanistically analogous to ubiquitination, but requires a different E1-activating enzyme and Ubc9, a SUMO-specific E2-conjugating enzyme. Here, we show that two members of the PIAS family, PIAS1 and PIASxbeta, act as specific E3-like ligases that promote sumoylation of p53 and c-Jun in vitro and in vivo. The PIAS proteins physically interact with both p53 and c-Jun. In addition, they bind to Ubc9, suggesting that they recruit the E2 enzyme to their respective substrate. The SUMO ligase activity requires the conserved zinc-finger domain, which is distantly related to the essential RING-finger motif, found in a subset of ubiquitin ligases. Furthermore, similar to RING-type ubiquitin ligases, PIASxbeta can catalyze its own modification. Hence, these data further extend the analogy between the ubiquitin and SUMO pathway. Strikingly, PIAS proteins strongly repress the transcriptional activity of p53, suggesting that the PIAS-SUMO pathway plays a crucial role in the regulation of p53 and presumably other transcription factors.

SUMOylation plays an important role in cardiac function and can be protective against cardiac stress. Recent studies show that SUMOylation is an integral part of the ubiquitin proteasome system, and expression of the small ubiquitin-like modifier (SUMO) E2 enzyme UBC9 improves cardiac protein quality control. However, the precise role of SUMOylation on other protein degradation pathways, particularly autophagy, remains undefined in the heart. To determine whether SUMOylation affects cardiac autophagy and whether this effect is protective in a mouse model of proteotoxic cardiac stress. We modulated expression of UBC9, a SUMO E2 ligase, using gain- and loss-of-function in neonatal rat ventricular cardiomyocytes. UBC9 expression seemed to directly alter autophagic flux. To confirm this effect in vivo, we generated transgenic mice overexpressing UBC9 in cardiomyocytes. These mice have an increased level of SUMOylation at baseline and, in confirmation of the data obtained from neonatal rat ventricular cardiomyocytes, demonstrated increased autophagy, suggesting that increased UBC9-mediated SUMOylation is sufficient to upregulate cardiac autophagy. Finally, we tested the protective role of SUMOylation-mediated autophagy by expressing UBC9 in a model of cardiac proteotoxicity, induced by cardiomyocyte-specific expression of a mutant α-B-crystallin, mutant CryAB (CryAB(R120G)), which shows impaired autophagy. UBC9 overexpression reduced aggregate formation, decreased fibrosis, reduced hypertrophy, and improved cardiac function and survival. The data showed that increased UBC9-mediated SUMOylation is sufficient to induce relatively high levels of autophagy and may represent a novel strategy for increasing autophagic flux and ameliorating morbidity in proteotoxic cardiac disease.

Unlike ubiquitination, which targets proteins for degradation, sumoylation modulates protein-protein interactions of target proteins. Although there are multiple E2 enzymes required for ubiquitination, there is only one E2-conjugating enzyme for sumoylation, which is Ubc9. In line with increasing evidence that sumoylation plays an important role in tumorigenesis, we recently demonstrated that Ubc9 is expressed at high levels in advanced melanomas and that blocking expression of Ubc9 sensitizes melanomas to the cytotoxic effects of chemotherapeutic drugs. To determine whether and to what extent Ubc9 is expressed in other malignancies and their normal tissue counterparts, we undertook a detailed analysis of colon, lung, prostate, and breast cancer tissue microarrays. The findings, presented here, document that in primary colon and prostate cancer, Ubc9 expression is increased compared with their normal tissue counterparts, whereas in metastatic breast, prostate, and lung cancer, it is decreased in comparison with their corresponding normal and primary adenocarcinoma tissues. We also provide evidence that Ubc9 expression correlates positively with Dukes' stage and negatively with the Gleason score as well as breast cancer grade and that Ubc9 expression is substantially higher in the luminal than in the nonluminal type of breast cancer.

Sumoylation is a post-translational modification that plays an important role in a wide range of cellular processes. Among the proteins involved in the sumoylation pathway, Ubc9 is the sole E2-conjugating enzyme required for sumoylation and plays a central role by interacting with almost all of the partners required for sumoylation. Ubc9 has been implicated in a variety of human malignancies. In order to exploit the therapeutic potential of Ubc9, we have identified the potential site to target for rational drug design using molecular modeling approaches. The structural information derived was then used to prioritize hits from a small-molecule library for biological assay using a virtual screening protocol that involves shape matching with a known inhibitor inhibitors and docking of a small-molecule library utilizing computational approaches that incorporate both ligand and protein flexibility. Nineteen compounds were acquired from different chemical vendors and were tested for Ubc9 inhibitory activity. Five compounds showed inhibitory activity against Ubc9, out of which one compound was selected for further optimization. A similarity search was then carried out to retrieve commercially available derivatives, which were further acquired and assayed, resulting in two compounds with acceptable potency. These two compounds can be used as starting points for the development of more potent inhibitors of Ubc9 targeting the predicted site.

Ubc9 is an E2-conjugating enzyme required for sumoylation and has been implicated in regulating several critical cellular pathways. We have shown previously that Ubc9 is important for sumoylation and nucleolar delocalization of topoisomerase (topo) I in response to topo I inhibitors such as topotecan. However, the role for Ubc9 in tumor drug responsiveness is not clear. In this study, we found that although MCF7 cells expressing a Ubc9 dominant-negative mutant (Ubc9-DN) display decreased activity of topo I, these cells are more sensitive to the topo I inhibitor topotecan and other anticancer agents such as VM-26 and cisplatin. In addition, we found that alteration of Ubc9 expression correlates with drug responsiveness in tumor cell lines. To understand possible mechanisms of Ubc9-associated drug responsiveness, we examined several proteins that have been shown to interact with Ubc9 and that may be involved in drug responsiveness. One such protein is Daxx, which is a Fas-associated protein that plays a role in Fas-mediated apoptosis by participating in a caspase-independent pathway through activation of apoptosis signal-regulating kinase 1 and c-Jun NH(2)-terminal kinase. We found that cells expressing Ubc9-DN accumulate more cytoplasmic Daxx than the control cells. Because cytoplasmic Daxx is believed to participate in cellular apoptosis, we suggest that the interaction of Ubc9 with Daxx and subsequent alteration in the subcellular localization of Daxx may contribute to the increased sensitivity to anticancer drugs in the cells expressing Ubc9-DN. Finally, we found that overexpression of Daxx sensitizes cells to anticancer drugs possibly in part through alterations of the ratio of cytoplasmic and nuclear Daxx. Together, our results suggest a role for Ubc9 in tumor drug responsiveness.

The Drosophila protein Sex Comb on Midleg (Scm) is a member of the Polycomb group (PcG), a set of transcriptional repressors that maintain silencing of homeotic genes during development. Recent findings have identified PcG proteins both as targets for modification by the small ubiquitin-like modifier (SUMO) protein and as catalytic components of the SUMO conjugation pathway. We have found that the SUMO-conjugating enzyme Ubc9 binds to Scm and that this interaction, which requires the Scm C-terminal sterile α motif (SAM) domain, is crucial for the efficient sumoylation of Scm. Scm is associated with the major Polycomb response element (PRE) of the homeotic gene Ultrabithorax (Ubx), and efficient PRE recruitment requires an intact Scm SAM domain. Global reduction of sumoylation augments binding of Scm to the PRE. This is likely to be a direct effect of Scm sumoylation because mutations in the SUMO acceptor sites in Scm enhance its recruitment to the PRE, whereas translational fusion of SUMO to the Scm N terminus interferes with this recruitment. In the metathorax, Ubx expression promotes haltere formation and suppresses wing development. When SUMO levels are reduced, we observe decreased expression of Ubx and partial haltere-to-wing transformation phenotypes. These observations suggest that SUMO negatively regulates Scm function by impeding its recruitment to the Ubx major PRE.

Fibrosis is a predominant cause of death in systemic sclerosis (SSc). First epigenetic modifications have recently been shown to contribute to activation of SSc fibroblasts. Here, we investigated inhibition of sumoylation as a novel antifibrotic approach. Sumoylation was inhibited by siRNA-mediated knockdown of the Small Ubiquitin-like MOdifiers (SUMO) E2-conjugating enzyme Ubc9, which is essential for sumoylation. The effects of knockdown of Ubc9 were analysed in bleomycin-induced dermal fibrosis, and in the model of fibrosis induced by overexpression of a constitutively active TGF-beta receptor type I (TBR). SUMO-1 and phosphorylated Smad3 were detected by immunohistochemistry. Increased staining for SUMO-1 was detected in patients with SSc and in experimental fibrosis. Inhibition of sumoylation exerted potent antifibrotic effects and prevented dermal thickening, myofibroblast differentiation and accumulation of collagen induced by bleomycin, or by overexpression of constitutively active TBR. Moreover, knockdown of Ubc9 reduced the accumulation of phosphorylated Smad3 in experimental fibrosis indicating that inhibition of sumoylation may normalise canonical TGF-β signalling in vivo. We demonstrate that inhibition of sumoylation reduces canonical TGF-β signalling and prevents experimental fibrosis in different preclinical models. These data provide first evidence that targeting of aberrant sumoylation may be a novel therapeutic approach for fibrotic diseases.

Foxp3-expressing regulatory T (Treg) cells are essential for immune tolerance; however, the molecular mechanisms underlying Treg cell expansion and function are still not well understood. SUMOylation is a protein post-translational modification characterized by covalent attachment of SUMO moieties to lysines. UBC9 is the only E2 conjugating enzyme involved in this process, and loss of UBC9 completely abolishes the SUMOylation pathway. Here, we report that selective deletion of Ubc9 within the Treg lineage results in fatal early-onset autoimmunity similar to Foxp3 mutant mice. Ubc9-deficient Treg cells exhibit severe defects in TCR-driven homeostatic proliferation, accompanied by impaired activation and compromised suppressor function. Importantly, TCR ligation enhanced SUMOylation of IRF4, a critical regulator of Treg cell function downstream of TCR signals, which regulates its stability in Treg cells. Our data thus have demonstrated an essential role of SUMOylation in the expansion and function of Treg cells.
