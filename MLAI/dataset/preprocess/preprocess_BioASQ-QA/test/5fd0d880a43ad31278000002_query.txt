Mouse embryonic stem cells (ESCs) represent the naïve ground state of the preimplantation epiblast and epiblast stem cells (EpiSCs) represent the primed state of the postimplantation epiblast. Studies have revealed that the ESC state is maintained by a dynamic mechanism characterized by cell-to-cell spontaneous and reversible differences in sensitivity to self-renewal and susceptibility to differentiation. This metastable condition ensures indefinite self-renewal and, at the same time, predisposes ESCs for differentiation to EpiSCs. Despite considerable advances, the molecular mechanism controlling the ESC state and pluripotency transition from ESCs to EpiSCs have not been fully elucidated. Here we show that Otx2, a transcription factor essential for brain development, plays a crucial role in ESCs and EpiSCs. Otx2 is required to maintain the ESC metastable state by antagonizing ground state pluripotency and promoting commitment to differentiation. Furthermore, Otx2 is required for ESC transition into EpiSCs and, subsequently, to stabilize the EpiSC state by suppressing, in pluripotent cells, the mesendoderm-to-neural fate switch in cooperation with BMP4 and Fgf2. However, according to its central role in neural development and differentiation, Otx2 is crucially required for the specification of ESC-derived neural precursors fated to generate telencephalic and mesencephalic neurons. We propose that Otx2 is a novel intrinsic determinant controlling the functional integrity of ESCs and EpiSCs.

The transcription factor Otx2 acts as a negative switch in the regulation of transition from naive to primed pluripotency in mouse pluripotent stem cells. However, the molecular features and function of porcine OTX2 have not been well elucidated in porcine-induced pluripotent stem cells (piPSCs). By studying high-throughput transcriptome sequencing and interfering endogenous <i>OTX2</i> expression, we demonstrate that OTX2 is able to downgrade the self-renewal of piPSCs. <i>OTX2</i> is highly expressed in porcine brain, reproductive tissues, and preimplantation embryos, but is undetectable in fibroblasts and most somatic tissues. However, the known piPSC lines reported previously produced different levels of OTX2 depending on the induction procedures and culture conditions. Overexpression of porcine OTX2 can reduce the percentage of alkaline phosphatase-positive colonies and downregulate <i>NANOG</i> and <i>OCT4</i> expression. In contrast, knockdown of <i>OTX2</i> can significantly increase endogenous expressions of <i>NANOG</i>, <i>OCT4</i>, and <i>ESRRB</i>, and stabilize the pluripotent state of piPSCs. On the other hand, NANOG can directly bind to the <i>OTX2</i> promoter as shown in ChIP-seq data and repress <i>OTX2</i> promoter activity in a dose-dependent manner. These observations indicate that OTX2 and NANOG can form a negative feedback circuitry to regulate the pluripotency of porcine iPS cells.

Directed differentiation of human induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) into retinal pigmented epithelium (RPE) holds great promise in cell replacement therapy for patients suffering from degenerative eye diseases, including age-related macular degeneration (AMD). In this study, we generated iPSCs from human dermal fibroblasts (HDFs) by electroporation with episomal plasmid vectors encoding OCT4, SOX2, KLF4, L-MYC together with p53 suppression. Intriguingly, cell reprogramming resulted in a metastable transcriptional activation and selective demethylation of neural and retinal specification-associated genes, such as OTX2, RX1 and SIX3. In contrast, RPE progenitor genes were transcriptionally silent in HDFs and descendant iPSCs. Overexpression of OCT4 and SOX2 directly stimulated the expression of OTX2, RX1 and SIX3 in HDFs and iPSCs. Luciferase and chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) assays further identified an OCT4- and two SOX2-binding sites located in the proximal promoter of OTX2. Histone acetylation and methylation on the local promoter also participated in the reactivation of OTX2. The transcriptional conversion of RX1 and SIX3 genes partially attributed to DNA demethylation. Subsequently, iPSCs were induced into the RPE cells displaying the characteristics of polygonal shapes and pigments, and expressing typical RPE cell markers. Taken together, our results establish readily efficient and safe protocols to produce iPSCs and iPSC-derived RPE cells, and underline that the reactivation of anterior neural transcription factor OTX2, eye field transcription factor RX1 and SIX3 in iPSCs is a feature of pluripotency acquisition and predetermines the potential of RPE differentiation.

Development of multifunctional transcriptional activators is of increasing importance as they could trigger complicated gene networks. Recently, we developed a differential gene activating multifunctional small molecule SAHA-PIP (Sδ) by conjugating a histone deacetylase (HDAC) inhibitor, SAHA, to a selective DNA-binding pyrrole-imidazole polyamide (PIP). Epigenetic activity of Sδ was attributed to the active metal-binding (-NHOH) domain of SAHA. We synthesized a derivative of Sδ, called Jδ to evaluate the role of surface recognition domain (-phenyl) of SAHA in Sδ-mediated transcriptional activation. In vitro studies revealed that Jδ displayed potent inhibitory activity against HDAC8. Jδ retained the pluripotency gene-inducing ability of Sδ when used alone and in combination with Sδ; a notable increase in the pluripotency gene expression was observed. Interestingly, Jδ significantly induced the expression of HDAC8-controlled Otx2 and Lhx1. Our results suggest that the epigenetic activity of our multifunctional molecule could be altered to improve its efficiency as a transcriptional activator for intricate gene network(s).

Self-renewal and pluripotency in human embryonic stem cells (hESCs) depends upon the function of a remarkably small number of master transcription factors (TFs) that include OCT4, SOX2, and NANOG. Endogenous factors that regulate and maintain the expression of master TFs in hESCs remain largely unknown and/or uncharacterized. Here, we use a genome-wide, proteomics approach to identify proteins associated with the OCT4 enhancer. We identify known OCT4 regulators, plus a subset of potential regulators including a zinc finger protein, ZNF207, that plays diverse roles during development. In hESCs, ZNF207 partners with master pluripotency TFs to govern self-renewal and pluripotency while simultaneously controlling commitment of cells towards ectoderm through direct regulation of neuronal TFs, including OTX2. The distinct roles of ZNF207 during differentiation occur via isoform switching. Thus, a distinct isoform of ZNF207 functions in hESCs at the nexus that balances pluripotency and differentiation to ectoderm.

The enhancer landscape is dramatically restructured as naive preimplantation epiblasts transition to the post-implantation state of primed pluripotency. A key factor in this process is Otx2, which is upregulated during the early stages of this transition and ultimately recruits Oct4 to a different set of enhancers. In this study, we discover that the acetylation status of Oct4 regulates the induction of the primed pluripotency gene network. Maintenance of the naive state requires the NAD-dependent deacetylase, SirT1, which deacetylates Oct4. The activity of SirT1 is reduced during the naive-to-primed transition; Oct4 becomes hyper-acetylated and binds to an Otx2 enhancer to induce Otx2 expression. Induction of Otx2 causes the reorganization of acetylated Oct4 and results in the induction of the primed pluripotency gene network. Regulation of Oct4 by SirT1 may link stem cell development to environmental conditions, and it may provide strategies to manipulate epiblast cell state.

Following implantation, the naive pluripotent epiblast of the mouse blastocyst generates a rosette, undergoes lumenogenesis and forms the primed pluripotent egg cylinder, which is able to generate the embryonic tissues. How pluripotency progression and morphogenesis are linked and whether intermediate pluripotent states exist remain controversial. We identify here a rosette pluripotent state defined by the co-expression of naive factors with the transcription factor OTX2. Downregulation of blastocyst WNT signals drives the transition into rosette pluripotency by inducing OTX2. The rosette then activates MEK signals that induce lumenogenesis and drive progression to primed pluripotency. Consequently, combined WNT and MEK inhibition supports rosette-like stem cells, a self-renewing naive-primed intermediate. Rosette-like stem cells erase constitutive heterochromatin marks and display a primed chromatin landscape, with bivalently marked primed pluripotency genes. Nonetheless, WNT induces reversion to naive pluripotency. The rosette is therefore a reversible pluripotent intermediate whereby control over both pluripotency progression and morphogenesis pivots from WNT to MEK signals.

The mouse embryo is the canonical model for mammalian preimplantation development. Recent advances in single cell profiling allow detailed analysis of embryogenesis in other eutherian species, including human, to distinguish conserved from divergent regulatory programs and signalling pathways in the rodent paradigm. Here, we identify and compare transcriptional features of human, marmoset and mouse embryos by single cell RNA-seq. Zygotic genome activation correlates with the presence of polycomb repressive complexes in all three species, while ribosome biogenesis emerges as a predominant attribute in primate embryos, supporting prolonged translation of maternally deposited RNAs. We find that transposable element expression signatures are species, stage and lineage specific. The pluripotency network in the primate epiblast lacks certain regulators that are operative in mouse, but encompasses WNT components and genes associated with trophoblast specification. Sequential activation of GATA6, SOX17 and GATA4 markers of primitive endoderm identity is conserved in primates. Unexpectedly, OTX2 is also associated with primitive endoderm specification in human and non-human primate blastocysts. Our cross-species analysis demarcates both conserved and primate-specific features of preimplantation development, and underscores the molecular adaptability of early mammalian embryogenesis.

In vitro neural differentiation of human embryonic stem cells (hESCs) is an advantageous system for studying early neural development. The process of early neural differentiation in hESCs begins by initiation of primitive neuroectoderm, which is manifested by rosette formation, with consecutive differentiation into neural progenitors and early glial-like cells. In this study, we examined the involvement of early neural markers - OTX2, PAX6, Sox1, Nestin, NR2F1, NR2F2, and IRX2 - in the onset of rosette formation, during spontaneous neural differentiation of hESC and human induced pluripotent stem cell (hiPSC) colonies. This is in contrast to the conventional way of studying rosette formation, which involves induction of neuronal differentiation and the utilization of embryoid bodies. Here we show that OTX2 is highly expressed at the onset of rosette formation, when rosettes comprise no more than 3-5 cells, and that its expression precedes that of established markers of early neuronal differentiation. Importantly, the rise of OTX2 expression in these cells coincides with the down-regulation of the pluripotency marker OCT4. Lastly, we show that cells derived from rosettes that emerge during spontaneous differentiation of hESCs or hiPSCs are capable of differentiating into dopaminergic neurons in vitro, and into mature-appearing pyramidal and serotonergic neurons weeks after being injected into the motor cortex of NOD-SCID mice.

Embryonic stem cells (ESCs) cultured in leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF) plus fetal bovine serum (FBS) exhibit heterogeneity in the expression of naive and primed transcription factors. This heterogeneity reflects the dynamic condition of ESCs and their versatility to promptly respond to signaling effectors promoting naive or primed pluripotency. Here, we report that ESCs lacking Nanog or overexpressing Otx2 exhibit an early primed identity in LIF + FBS and fail to convert into 2i-induced naive state. Conversely, Otx2-null ESCs possess naive identity features in LIF + FBS similar to Nanog-overexpressing ESCs and convert poorly into FGF-induced early primed state. When both Nanog and Otx2 are inactivated, ESCs cultured in LIF + FBS exhibit primed identity and weakened ability to convert into naive state. These data suggest that, through mutual antagonism, NANOG and OTX2 specify the heterogeneous identity of ESCs cultured in LIF + FBS and individually predispose them for optimal response to naive or primed inducing factors.

Naive and primed pluripotency is characterized by distinct signaling requirements, transcriptomes, and developmental properties, but both cellular states share key transcriptional regulators: Oct4, Sox2, and Nanog. Here, we demonstrate that transition between these two pluripotent states is associated with widespread Oct4 relocalization, mirrored by global rearrangement of enhancer chromatin landscapes. Our genomic and biochemical analyses identified candidate mediators of primed state-specific Oct4 binding, including Otx2 and Zic2/3. Even when differentiation cues are blocked, premature Otx2 overexpression is sufficient to exit the naive state, induce transcription of a substantial subset of primed pluripotency-associated genes, and redirect Oct4 to previously inaccessible enhancer sites. However, the ability of Otx2 to engage new enhancer regions is determined by its levels, cis-encoded properties of the sites, and the signaling environment. Our results illuminate regulatory mechanisms underlying pluripotency and suggest that the capacity of transcription factors such as Otx2 and Oct4 to pioneer new enhancer sites is highly context dependent.

Naïve and primed pluripotent stem cells (PSCs) reflect discrete pluripotent states that approximate the inner cell mass or the progressively lineage-restricted perigastrulation epiblast, respectively. Cells that occupy primed pluripotency have distinct epigenetic landscapes, transcriptional circuitry, and trophic requirements compared with their naïve counterparts. The existence of multiple pluripotent states has not been explored in dogs, which show promise as outbred biomedical models with more than 300 inherited diseases that also afflict humans. However, our understanding of canine embryogenesis and embryo-derived stem cells is limited. Herein, we converted leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF)-dependent and fibroblast growth factor 2 (FGF2)-dependent canine embryonic stem cells (cESCs) resembling primed PSCs toward a naïve pluripotent state using LIF and inhibitors of glycogen synthase kinase 3β and mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase 1/2 [called 2i and LIF (2iL)]. cESCs propagated in 2iL exhibited significant induction of genes associated with the naïve pluripotent state (eg, REX1, TBX3) and downregulation of primed pluripotency markers (eg, OTX2, FGF5) (P < 0.05). Differential phosphorylation of signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3) and cell fate decisions on exposure to bone morphogenetic protein 4 (BMP4) suggested that a novel pluripotent identity has been established with 2iL. Accordingly, cESCs cultured with 2iL formed colonies at a greater efficiency than LIF-FGF2 cESCs following single-cell dissociation. Total genomic DNA methylation and histone H3 lysine 27 trimethylation signals were reduced in 2iL-treated cESCs. Our data suggest that 2iL culture conditions promote the conversion of cESCs toward an epigenetically distinct pluripotent state resembling naïve PSCs.

Embryonic stem cells (ESCs) are unique in that they have the capacity to differentiate into all of the cell types in the body. We know a lot about the complex transcriptional control circuits that maintain the naive pluripotent state under self-renewing conditions but comparatively less about how cells exit from this state in response to differentiation stimuli. Here, we examined the role of Otx2 in this process in mouse ESCs and demonstrate that it plays a leading role in remodeling the gene regulatory networks as cells exit from ground state pluripotency. Otx2 drives enhancer activation through affecting chromatin marks and the activity of associated genes. Mechanistically, Oct4 is required for Otx2 expression, and reciprocally, Otx2 is required for efficient Oct4 recruitment to many enhancer regions. Therefore, the Oct4-Otx2 regulatory axis actively establishes a new regulatory chromatin landscape during the early events that accompany exit from ground state pluripotency.

Mouse embryonic stem cells (ESCs) and the inner cell mass (ICM)-derived epiblast exhibit naive pluripotency. ESC-derived epiblast stem cells (EpiSCs) and the postimplantation epiblast exhibit primed pluripotency. Although core pluripotency factors are well-characterized, additional regulators, including Otx2, recently have been shown to function during the transition from naive to primed pluripotency. Here we uncover a role for Otx2 in the control of the naive pluripotent state. We analyzed Otx2-binding activity in ESCs and EpiSCs and identified Nanog, Oct4, and Sox2 as direct targets. To unravel the Otx2 transcriptional network, we targeted the strongest Otx2-binding site in the Nanog promoter, finding that this site modulates the size of specific ESC-subtype compartments in cultured cells and promotes Nanog expression in vivo, predisposing ICM differentiation to epiblast. Otx2-mediated Nanog regulation thus contributes to the integrity of the ESC state and cell lineage specification in preimplantation development.

Reported pig induced pluripotent stem cells (piPSCs) have shown either a bFGF-dependent state with human embryonic stem cell (ESC) and mouse epiblast stem cell (EpiSC) morphology and molecular features or piPSCs exist in a LIF-dependent state and resemble fully reprogrammed mouse iPSCs. The features of authentic piPSCs and molecular events during the reprogramming are largely unknown. In this study, we assessed the transcriptome profile of multiple piPSC lines derived from different laboratories worldwide and compared to mouse and human iPSCs to determine the molecular signaling pathways that might play a central role in authentic piPSCs. The results demonstrated that the up-regulation of endogenous epithelial cells adhesion molecule (EpCAM) was correlated with the pluripotent state of pig pluripotent cells, which could be utilized as a marker for evaluating pig cell reprogramming. Comparison of key signaling pathways JAK-STAT, NOTCH, TGFB1, WNT and VEGF in pig, mouse and human iPSCs showed that the core transcriptional network to maintain pluripotency and self-renewal in pig were different from that in mouse, but had significant similarities to human. Pig iPSCs, which lacked expression of specific naïve state markers KLF2/4/5 and TBX3, but expressed the primed state markers of Otx2 and Fabp7, share defining features with human ESCs and mouse EpiSCs. The cluster of imprinted genes delineated by the delta-like homolog 1 gene and the type III iodothyronine deiodinase gene (DLK1-DIO3) were silenced in piPSCs as previously seen in mouse iPSCs that have limited ability to contribute to chimaeras. These key differences in naïve state gene and imprinting gene expression suggests that so far known piPSC lines may be more similar to primed state cells. The primed state of these cells may potentially explain the rare ability of piPSCS to generate chimeras and cloned offspring.

Porcine OTX2 was found to be highly activated in porcine iPS cells (piPSCs) that were reported by different laboratories worldwide. To reveal the regulatory function of OTX2 in porcine reprogrammed cells, we screened porcine miRNA-seq databases and found two miRNAs, miR-1343 and miR-545, that could specifically bind to 3'UTR of OTX2 and suppress endogenous OTX2 expression in piPSCs. Knockdown of OTX2 by miR-1343 and miR-545 could significantly increase the expression of SOX2 and ESRRB, but did not alter the expressions of OCT4 and KLF4, and improve the pluripotency of piPSCs. The promoter-based assays showed that OTX2 potentially bound to the promoter region of SOX2 and ESRRB and suppressed their expression. On the other hand, SOX2 could interact with OTX2 promoter. Ectopic expression of SOX2 could significantly decrease OTX2 promoter activity, showing that there is a negative feedback loop between SOX2 and OTX2. Additionally, SOX2 and ESRRB significantly stimulated miR-1343 expression in piPSCs, but OTX2 down regulated the expression of miR-1343 in either direct or indirect manners. In summary, this study demonstrates that there is a regulatory network mediated by miR-1343, in which downregulation of OTX2 by miR-1343 can elevate the expression of pluripotent genes that were then sustain the pluripotency of piPSCs.

Lin28 RNA-binding proteins play important roles in pluripotent stem cells, but the regulation of their expression and the mechanisms underlying their functions are still not definitively understood. Here we address the above-mentioned issues in the first steps of mouse embryonic stem cell (ESC) differentiation. We observed that the expression of <i>Lin28</i> genes is transiently induced soon after the exit of ESCs from the naive ground state and that this induction is due to the Hmga2-dependent engagement of Otx2 with enhancers present at both <i>Lin28</i> gene loci. These mechanisms are crucial for Lin28 regulation, as demonstrated by the abolishment of the Lin28 accumulation in Otx2- or Hmga2-knockout cells compared to the control cells. We have also found that Lin28 controls Hmga2 expression levels during ESC differentiation through a let-7-independent mechanism. Indeed, we found that Lin28 proteins bind a highly conserved element in the 3' UTR of Hmga2 mRNA, and this provokes a down-regulation of its translation. This mechanism prevents the inappropriate accumulation of Hmga2 that would modify the proliferation and physiological apoptosis of differentiating ESCs. In summary, we demonstrated that during ESC differentiation, Lin28 transient induction is dependent on Otx2 and Hmga2 and prevents an inappropriate excessive rise of Hmga2 levels.-Parisi, S., Passaro, F., Russo, L., Musto, A., Navarra, A., Romano, S., Petrosino, G., Russo, T. Lin28 is induced in primed embryonic stem cells and regulates let-7-independent events.

Sall1 is a multi-zinc finger transcription factor that regulates kidney organogenesis. It is considered to be a transcriptional repressor, preferentially localized on heterochromatin. Mutations or deletions of the human SALL1 gene are associated with the Townes-Brocks syndrome. Despite its high expression, no function was yet assigned for Sall1 in embryonic stem (ES) cells. In the present study, we show that Sall1 is expressed in a differentiation-dependent manner and physically interacts with Nanog and Sox2, two components of the core pluripotency network. Genome-wide mapping of Sall1-binding loci has identified 591 genes, 80% of which are also targeted by Nanog. A large proportion of these genes are related to self-renewal and differentiation. Sall1 positively regulates and synergizes with Nanog for gene transcriptional regulation. In addition, our data show that Sall1 suppresses the ectodermal and mesodermal differentiation. Specifically, the induction of the gastrulation markers T brachyury, Goosecoid, and Dkk1 and the neuroectodermal markers Otx2 and Hand1 was inhibited by Sall1 overexpression during embryoid body differentiation. These data demonstrate a novel role for Sall1 as a member of the transcriptional network that regulates stem cell pluripotency.
