Hereditary hearing loss is characterized by a very high genetic heterogeneity. The OTOF (Locus: DFNB9), encoding otoferlin, is reported to be one of the major causes of non-syndromic hearing loss, and is also reported to be the most common cause of non-syndromic recessive auditory neuropathy spectrum disorder. In this study, whole exome sequencing was employed for detection of novel pathogenic variant that segregates with autosomal recessive nonsyndromic hearing loss in a tribal family from Rajouri, Jammu and Kashmir. Proband was a 9-year-old male born to first-cousin parents and presented with sensorineural hearing loss since birth. Family resides in an area with high consanguinity and lack of basic health care facilities including genetic counselling services. We report a novel OTOF pathogenic variant NM_194248.2:c.4249_4250insG (p.Ser1417CysfsTer4) co-segregating with hearing loss in this family and not present in any public databases. Our findings not only extend the geographical and mutational spectrum of autosomal recessive nonsyndromic hearing loss but also support the need for introducing genetic counselling services to rural and tribal areas in India with high consanguinity.

Different mutations of the OTOF gene, encoding for otoferlin protein expressed in the cochlear inner hair cells, induces a form of deafness that is the major cause of nonsyndromic recessive auditory neuropathy spectrum disorder in humans. We report the generation of the first large animal model of OTOF mutations using the CRISPR system associated with different Cas9 components (mRNA or protein) assisted by single strand oligodeoxynucleotides (ssODN) to induce homology-directed repair (HDR). Zygote microinjection was performed with two sgRNA targeting exon 5 and 6 associated to Cas9 mRNA or protein (RNP) at different concentrations in a mix with an ssODN template targeting HDR in exon 5 containing two STOP sequences. A total of 73 lambs were born, 13 showing indel mutations (17.8%), 8 of which (61.5%) had knock-in mutations by HDR. Higher concentrations of Cas9-RNP induced targeted mutations more effectively, but negatively affected embryo survival and pregnancy rate. This study reports by the first time the generation of OTOF disrupted sheep, which may allow better understanding and development of new therapies for human deafness related to genetic disorders. These results support the use of CRISPR/Cas system assisted by ssODN as an effective tool for gene editing in livestock.

Normal hearing and synaptic transmission at afferent auditory inner hair cell (IHC) synapses require otoferlin. Deafness DFNB9, caused by mutations in the <i>OTOF</i> gene encoding otoferlin, might be treated by transferring wild-type otoferlin cDNA into IHCs, which is difficult due to the large size of this transgene. In this study, we generated two adeno-associated viruses (AAVs), each containing half of the otoferlin cDNA Co-injecting these dual-AAV2/6 half-vectors into the cochleae of 6- to 7-day-old otoferlin knock-out (<i>Otof</i><sup>-/-</sup>) mice led to the expression of full-length otoferlin in up to 50% of IHCs. In the cochlea, otoferlin was selectively expressed in auditory hair cells. Dual-AAV transduction of <i>Otof</i><sup>-/-</sup> IHCs fully restored fast exocytosis, while otoferlin-dependent vesicle replenishment reached 35-50% of wild-type levels. The loss of 40% of synaptic ribbons in these IHCs could not be prevented, indicating a role of otoferlin in early synapse maturation. Acoustic clicks evoked auditory brainstem responses with thresholds of 40-60Â dB. Therefore, we propose that gene delivery mediated by dual-AAV vectors might be suitable to treat deafness forms caused by mutations in large genes such as <i>OTOF</i>.

Otoferlin (<i>OTOF</i>) gene mutations are the most common cause of hereditary ANSD according to investigations in several countries. Of this study was to estimate the prevalence of <i>OTOF</i> mutations in Russian children with ANSD and evaluate audiological and clinical features of <i>OTOF</i>-related ANSD. 28 children with bilateral ANSDwere enrolled in the investigation. Two step genetic testing was performed: first step - <i>GJB2</i> gene testing to exclude <i>GJB2</i>-related hearing loss; second step - NGS-based sequencing to explore another 35 hearing loss genes (including <i>OTOF</i>). <i>OTOF</i> mutations, including 6 new variants, were found in 5 children with ANSD (18%). All 5 children had no risk factors for hearing loss and passed hearing screening. OAE and cochlear microphonics were present till the last testing at the age of 4-5 years. ABR were not detectable. The ASSR were measurable bilaterally at all frequencies in all cases, but they did not correlate with behavioral thresholds that revealed severe hearing loss. Hearing thresholds were stable during follow up period. 3 children underwent cochlear implantation. After cochlear implantation auditory nerve action potentials to electric stimulation were detected within normal range. Genetic testing of children with ANSD and first of all <i>OTOF</i> testing enables to reveal hearing loss etiology and provide the optimal rehabilitation approach, including cochlear implantation, as early as possible.

Ferlins are multiple-C2-domain proteins involved in Ca2+-triggered membrane dynamics within the secretory, endocytic and lysosomal pathways. In bony vertebrates there are six ferlin genes encoding, in humans, dysferlin, otoferlin, myoferlin, Fer1L5 and 6 and the long noncoding RNA Fer1L4. Mutations in <i>DYSF</i> (dysferlin) can cause a range of muscle diseases with various clinical manifestations collectively known as dysferlinopathies, including limb-girdle muscular dystrophy type 2B (LGMD2B) and Miyoshi myopathy. A mutation in <i>MYOF</i> (myoferlin) was linked to a muscular dystrophy accompanied by cardiomyopathy. Mutations in <i>OTOF</i> (otoferlin) can be the cause of nonsyndromic deafness DFNB9. Dysregulated expression of any human ferlin may be associated with development of cancer. This review provides a detailed description of functions of the vertebrate ferlins with a focus on muscle ferlins and discusses the mechanisms leading to disease development.

The <i>OTOF</i> gene encodes otoferlin, a critical protein at the synapse of auditory sensory cells, the inner hair cells (IHCs). In the absence of otoferlin, signal transmission of IHCs fails due to impaired release of synaptic vesicles at the IHC synapse. Biallelic pathogenic and likely pathogenic variants in <i>OTOF</i> predominantly cause autosomal recessive profound prelingual deafness, DFNB9. Due to the isolated defect of synaptic transmission and initially preserved otoacoustic emissions (OAEs), the clinical characteristics have been termed "auditory synaptopathy". We review the broad phenotypic spectrum reported in patients with variants in <i>OTOF</i> that includes milder hearing loss, as well as progressive and temperature-sensitive hearing loss. We highlight several challenges that must be addressed for rapid clinical and genetic diagnosis. Importantly, we call for changes in newborn hearing screening protocols, since OAE tests fail to diagnose deafness in this case. Continued research appears to be needed to complete otoferlin isoform expression characterization to enhance genetic diagnostics. This timely review is meant to sensitize the field to clinical characteristics of DFNB9 and current limitations in preparation for clinical trials for <i>OTOF</i> gene therapies that are projected to start in 2021.
