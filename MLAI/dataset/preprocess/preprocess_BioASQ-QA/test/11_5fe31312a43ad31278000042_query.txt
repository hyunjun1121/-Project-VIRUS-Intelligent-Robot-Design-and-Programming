Which is the master oncogenic transcription factor in T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia?

[PMID: 28028313]
The transcription factor TAL1/SCL is one of the most prevalent oncogenes in T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (T-ALL), a malignant disorder resulting from leukemic transformation of thymus T-cell precursors. TAL1 is normally expressed in hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) but is silenced in immature thymocytes. We hypothesize that TAL1 contributes to leukemogenesis by activating genes that are normally repressed in immature thymocytes. Herein, we identified a novel TAL1-regulated super-enhancer controlling the GIMAP locus, which resides within an insulated chromosomal locus in T-ALL cells. The GIMAP genes are expressed in HSCs and mature T cells but are downregulated during the immature stage of thymocyte differentiation. The GIMAP enhancer is activated by TAL1, RUNX1 and GATA3 in human T-ALL cells but is repressed by E-proteins. Overexpression of human GIMAP genes in immature thymocytes alone does not induce tumorigenesis but accelerates leukemia development in zebrafish. Our results demonstrate that aberrant activation of the GIMAP enhancer contributes to T-cell leukemogenesis.

Previous results indicated that miR-146b-5p is downregulated by TAL1, a transcription factor critical for early hematopoiesis that is frequently overexpressed in T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (T-ALL) where it has an oncogenic role. Here, we confirmed that miR-146b-5p expression is lower in TAL1-positive patient samples than in other T-ALL cases. Furthermore, leukemia T-cells display decreased levels of miR-146b-5p as compared to normal T-cells, thymocytes and other hematopoietic progenitors. MiR-146b-5p silencing enhances the in vitro migration and invasion of T-ALL cells, associated with increased levels of filamentous actin and chemokinesis. In vivo, miR-146b overexpression in a TAL1-positive cell line extends mouse survival in a xenotransplant model of human T-ALL. In contrast, knockdown of miR-146b-5p results in leukemia acceleration and decreased mouse overall survival, paralleled by faster tumor infiltration of the central nervous system. Our results suggest that miR-146b-5p is a functionally relevant microRNA gene in the context of T-ALL, whose negative regulation by TAL1 and possibly other oncogenes contributes to disease progression by modulating leukemia cell motility and disease aggressiveness.

T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia is a hematologic malignancy characterized by T-cell proliferation, and in many cases, the ectopic expression of the oncogenic transcription factor T-cell acute lymphocytic leukemia protein 1 (TAL1). MicroRNA-7 has been shown to play a critical role in proliferation, migration, and treatment sensitivity in a diverse array of cancers. In this study, we sought to establish a novel link between microRNA-7 and T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia oncogenesis. To do so, we characterized gene expression of microRNA-7 as well as <i>TAL1</i> in both T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia patient-derived tissue and cell lines, as well as performing functional luciferase assays to assess microRNA-7 binding to the <i>TAL1</i> 3'-untranslated region. We also performed growth, apoptosis, and migration experiments using 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-Yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide, Annexin V, and transwell assays in the context of microRNA-7 overexpression. We found that microRNA-7 expression is attenuated and inversely correlated with <i>TAL1</i> expression in TAL1 + T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia cells. Additionally, microRNA-7 directly targets and suppresses TAL1 levels. Finally, microRNA-7 overexpression reduces growth, motility, and migration while inducing apoptosis in T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia cells, phenotypes that can be rescued by concomitant overexpression of TAL1. These results indicate that microRNA-7 functions as a potent tumor suppressor by inhibiting the oncogene TAL1 and suggest microRNA-7 could function as a prognostic biomarker and possible therapeutic in the clinical management of T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia.

In hematopoietic cell development, the transcriptional program is strictly regulated in a lineage- and stage-specific manner that requires a number of transcription factors to work in a cascade or in a loop, in addition to interactions with nonhematopoietic cells in the microenvironment. Disruption of the transcriptional program alters the cellular state and may predispose cells to the acquisition of genetic abnormalities. Early studies have shown that proteins that promote cell differentiation often serve as tumor suppressors, whereas inhibitors of those proteins act as oncogenes in the context of acute leukemia. A prime example is T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (T-ALL), a malignant disorder characterized by clonal proliferation of immature stage thymocytes. Although a relatively small number of genetic abnormalities are observed in T-ALL, these abnormalities are crucial for leukemogenesis. Many oncogenes and tumor suppressors in T-ALL are transcription factors that are required for normal hematopoiesis. The transformation process in T-ALL is efficient and orchestrated; the oncogene disrupts the transcriptional program directing T-cell differentiation and also uses its native ability as a master transcription factor in hematopoiesis. This imbalance in the transcriptional program is a primary determinant underlying the molecular pathogenesis of T-ALL. In this review, we focus on the oncogenic transcription factor TAL1 and the tumor-suppressor E-proteins and discuss the malignant cell state, the transcriptional circuit, and the consequence of molecular abnormalities in T-ALL.

The oncogenic transcription factor <i>TAL1/SCL</i> induces an aberrant transcriptional program in T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (T-ALL) cells. However, the critical factors that are directly activated by TAL1 and contribute to T-ALL pathogenesis are largely unknown. Here, we identified <i>AT-rich interactive domain 5B</i> (<i>ARID5B</i>) as a collaborating oncogenic factor involved in the transcriptional program in T-ALL. <i>ARID5B</i> expression is down-regulated at the double-negative 2-4 stages in normal thymocytes, while it is induced by the TAL1 complex in human T-ALL cells. The enhancer located 135 kb upstream of the <i>ARID5B</i> gene locus is activated under a superenhancer in T-ALL cells but not in normal T cells. Notably, ARID5B-bound regions are associated predominantly with active transcription. ARID5B and TAL1 frequently co-occupy target genes and coordinately control their expression. ARID5B positively regulates the expression of TAL1 and its regulatory partners. ARID5B also activates the expression of the oncogene <i>MYC</i> Importantly, ARID5B is required for the survival and growth of T-ALL cells<i>,</i> and forced expression of ARID5B in immature thymocytes results in thymus retention, differentiation arrest, radioresistance, and tumor formation in zebrafish. Our results indicate that ARID5B reinforces the oncogenic transcriptional program by positively regulating the TAL1-induced regulatory circuit and <i>MYC</i> in T-ALL, thereby contributing to T-cell leukemogenesis.

The Tal1 oncogene is a class II basic helix-loop-helix (bHLH) transcription factor, overexpressed in as much as 60% of T cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia cases. Like other class II bHLH proteins, Tal1 can heterodimerize with the class I bHLH proteins, such as E47, and bind to a DNA recognition sequence termed E box. Therefore, it is believed that the oncogenic capacity of Tal1 lies in its ability, as a heterodimer with E47, to activate aberrantly a set of "leukemogenic" genes in T cells. However, compared with E47 homodimers, Tal1/E47 heterodimers are very poor transactivators. Thus the effect of Tal1 is actually to inhibit E47 homodimer activity. Here we propose that the transforming properties of Tal1 are the result of its ability to inhibit E47 activity. We address the mechanism of Tal1 inhibition and demonstrate that Tal1/E47 heterodimers cannot activate transcription because their respective activation domains are incompatible. Furthermore, we present data showing that Tal1 can inhibit E47-mediated activation of the CIP1 gene. Finally, we demonstrate that Tal1 inhibits E47 activity in leukemic T cells.

Aberrant expression of transcription factor oncogenes such as HOX11, HOX11L2, TAL1/SCL, LYL1, LMO1, and LMO2 can be detected in lymphoblasts from up to 80% of patients with acute T-cell lymphoblastic leukemia (T-ALL). Transcriptional activation of these oncogenes in leukemic cells typically results from chromosomal rearrangements that place them next to highly active cis-acting transcriptional regulatory elements. However, biallelic activation of TAL1 in some T-ALL cases has been previously proposed. We have used allele-specific mRNA analysis to show that trans-acting mechanisms leading to biallelic overexpression of TAL1 are involved in 10 (42%) of 24 TAL1+ informative T-ALL cases, 2 (17%) of 12 HOX11+ informative cases, and 7 (64%) of 11 LMO2+ informative cases. We propose that aberrant expression of oncogenic transcription factors in a significant fraction of T-ALLs may result from loss of the upstream transcriptional mechanisms that normally down-regulate the expression of these oncogenes during T-cell development.

TAL1/SCL is a prime example of an oncogenic transcription factor that is abnormally expressed in acute leukemia due to the replacement of regulator elements. This gene has also been recognized as an essential regulator of hematopoiesis. TAL1 expression is strictly regulated in a lineage- and stage-specific manner. Such precise control is crucial for the switching of the transcriptional program. The misexpression of TAL1 in immature thymocytes leads to a widespread series of orchestrated downstream events that affect several different cellular machineries, resulting in a lethal consequence, namely T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (T-ALL). In this article, we will discuss the transcriptional regulatory network and downstream target genes, including protein-coding genes and non-coding RNAs, controlled by TAL1 in normal hematopoiesis and T-cell leukemogenesis.

The oncogenic transcription factor TAL1/SCL is aberrantly expressed in over 40% of cases of human T cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (T-ALL), emphasizing its importance in the molecular pathogenesis of T-ALL. Here we identify the core transcriptional regulatory circuit controlled by TAL1 and its regulatory partners HEB, E2A, LMO1/2, GATA3, and RUNX1. We show that TAL1 forms a positive interconnected autoregulatory loop with GATA3 and RUNX1 and that the TAL1 complex directly activates the MYB oncogene, forming a positive feed-forward regulatory loop that reinforces and stabilizes the TAL1-regulated oncogenic program. One of the critical downstream targets in this circuitry is the TRIB2 gene, which is oppositely regulated by TAL1 and E2A/HEB and is essential for the survival of T-ALL cells.

SCL/TAL1 (stem cell leukemia/T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia [T-ALL] 1) is an essential transcription factor in normal and malignant hematopoiesis. It is required for specification of the blood program during development, adult hematopoietic stem cell survival and quiescence, and terminal maturation of select blood lineages. Following ectopic expression, SCL contributes to oncogenesis in T-ALL. Remarkably, SCL's activities are all mediated through nucleation of a core quaternary protein complex (SCL:E-protein:LMO1/2 [LIM domain only 1 or 2]:LDB1 [LIM domain-binding protein 1]) and dynamic recruitment of conserved combinatorial associations of additional regulators in a lineage- and stage-specific context. The finely tuned control of SCL's regulatory functions (lineage priming, activation, and repression of gene expression programs) provides insight into fundamental developmental and transcriptional mechanisms, and highlights mechanistic parallels between normal and oncogenic processes. Importantly, recent discoveries are paving the way to the development of innovative therapeutic opportunities in SCL<sup>+</sup> T-ALL.

T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (T-ALL) is caused by the cooperation of multiple oncogenic lesions. We used exome sequencing on 67 T-ALLs to gain insight into the mutational spectrum in these leukemias. We detected protein-altering mutations in 508 genes, with an average of 8.2 mutations in pediatric and 21.0 mutations in adult T-ALL. Using stringent filtering, we predict seven new oncogenic driver genes in T-ALL. We identify CNOT3 as a tumor suppressor mutated in 7 of 89 (7.9%) adult T-ALLs, and its knockdown causes tumors in a sensitized Drosophila melanogaster model. In addition, we identify mutations affecting the ribosomal proteins RPL5 and RPL10 in 12 of 122 (9.8%) pediatric T-ALLs, with recurrent alterations of Arg98 in RPL10. Yeast and lymphoid cells expressing the RPL10 Arg98Ser mutant showed a ribosome biogenesis defect. Our data provide insights into the mutational landscape of pediatric versus adult T-ALL and identify the ribosome as a potential oncogenic factor.
