Poly (ADP-ribose) polymerases (PARPs) play diverse roles in various cellular processes that involve DNA repair and programmed cell death. Amongst these polymerases is PARP-1 which is the key DNA damage-sensing enzyme that acts as an initiator for the DNA repair mechanism. Dihydroorotate dehydrogenase (DHODH) is an enzyme in the pyrimidine biosynthetic pathway which is an important target for anti-hyperproliferative and anti-inflammatory drug design. Since these enzymes share a common role in the DNA replication and repair mechanisms, it may be beneficial to target both PARP-1 and DHODH in attempts to design new anti-cancer agents. Benzimidazole derivatives have shown a wide variety of pharmacological activities including PARP and DHODH inhibition. We hereby report the design, synthesis and bioactivities of a series of benzimidazole derivatives as inhibitors of both the PARP-1 and DHODH enzymes.

Malaria remains a globally prevalent infectious disease that leads to significant morbidity and mortality. While there are a number of drugs approved for its treatment, drug resistance has compromised most of them, making the development of new drugs for the treatment and prevention of malaria essential. The completion of the Plasmodium falciparum genome and a growing understanding of parasite biology are fueling the search for novel drug targets. Despite this, few targets have been chemically validated in vivo. The pyrimidine biosynthetic pathway illustrates one of the best examples of successful identification of anti-malarial drug targets. This review focuses on recent studies to exploit the fourth enzyme in the de novo pyrimidine biosynthetic pathway of P. falciparum, dihydroorotate dehydrogenase (PfDHODH), as a new target for drug discovery. Several chemical scaffolds have been identified by high throughput screening as potent inhibitors of PfDHODH and these show strong selectivity for the malarial enzyme over that from the human host. Potent activity against parasites in whole cell models with good correlation between activity on the enzyme and the parasite have also been observed for a number of the identified series. Lead optimization of a triazolopyrimidine-based series has identified an analog with prolonged plasma exposure, that is orally bioavailable, and which shows good efficacy against the in vivo mouse model of the disease. These data provide strong evidence that PfDHODH is a validated target for the identification of new antimalarial chemotherapy. The challenge remains to identify compounds with the necessary combination of potency and metabolic stability to allow identification of a clinical candidate.

Pyrimidine biosynthesis presents an attractive drug target in malaria parasites due to the absence of a pyrimidine salvage pathway. A set of compounds designed to inhibit the Plasmodium falciparum pyrimidine biosynthetic enzyme dihydroorotate dehydrogenase (PfDHODH) was synthesized. PfDHODH-specific inhibitors with low nanomolar binding affinities were identified that bind in the N-terminal hydrophobic channel of dihydroorotate dehydrogenase, the presumed site of ubiquinone binding during oxidation of dihydroorotate to orotate. These compounds also prevented growth of cultured parasites at low micromolar concentrations. Models that suggest the mode of inhibitor binding is based on shape complementarity, matching hydrophobic regions of inhibitor and enzyme, and interaction of inhibitors with amino acid residues F188, H185, and R265 are supported by mutagenesis data. These results further highlight PfDHODH as a promising new target for chemotherapeutic intervention in prevention of malaria and provide better understanding of the factors that determine specificity over human dihydroorotate dehydrogenase.

The flavoenzyme dihydroorotate dehydrogenase (DHODH) catalyzes the fourth reaction of the de novo pyrimidine biosynthetic pathway, which exerts vital functions in the cells, especially within DNA and RNA biosynthesis. Thus, this enzyme stands out as a new key molecular target for parasites causing Neglected Diseases (NDs). Focused on contributing to the development of new therapeutic alternatives for NDs, in this study, for the first time, a screening of 57 natural products for in vitro inhibition of Leishmania major DHODH (LmDHODH) was carried out, including cross validation against the human DHODH (HsDHODH). A subset of natural products consisting of 21 sesquiterpene lactones (STLs) was submitted to QSAR studies. Additionally, thermostability studies by differential scanning fluorimetry (DSF) were performed to determine whether the STLs are effectively or not binding to the enzyme. The IC<sub>50</sub> values against LmDHODH varied from 27 to 1200 μM; only irrelevant inhibition was obtained on HsDHODH. DSF assays confirmed binding of STLs to LmDHODH; moreover, it is suggested that such inhibitors might act in a different site other than the active site. A reliable QSAR model based on molecular descriptors was obtained (R<sup>2</sup>: 0.83; Q<sup>2</sup><sub>CV</sub>: 0.69 and Q<sup>2</sup><sub>EXT/F2</sub>: 0.66) indicating that stronger inhibition requires a balanced distribution of the hydrophobic regions across the molecular surface, as well as higher width and lower hydrophobicity of the molecules. A pharmacophore-based 3D-QSAR approach also afforded a useful model (R<sup>2</sup>: 0.72; Q<sup>2</sup><sub>CV</sub>: 0.50 and Q<sup>2</sup><sub>EXT/F2</sub>: 0.62), which confirmed the importance of proper orientation of the ligands, molecular surface features and shape for stronger inhibition, reflecting properties of a putative common binding site. These data indicated for the first time that natural products can actually inhibit LmDHODH and highlighted some metabolites as potentially interesting starting points for the discovery of more potent LmDHODH inhibitors, ultimately aiming at new effective therapeutic alternatives for leishmaniasis and, possibly, other NDs caused by trypanosomatids.

The novel anticancer drug candidate brequinar sodium (DuP 785, NSC 368390, 6-fluoro-2-(2'-fluoro-1,1'-biphenyl-4-yl)-3-methyl-4-quinoline- carboxylic acid sodium salt) was shown previously to be an inhibitor of dihydroorotate dehydrogenase, the fourth enzyme of the de novo pyrimidine biosynthetic pathway. Brequinar sodium inhibits the activity of this enzyme isolated from mammalian sources only but not those forms isolated from yeast or bacteria, which also use ubiquinone as the cofactor. Brequinar sodium also does not inhibit the activity of a soluble Zymobacterium oroticum dihydroorotate dehydrogenase which uses NAD+ as a cofactor. Brequinar sodium inhibits L1210 dihydroorotate dehydrogenase with mixed inhibition kinetics with respect to either the substrate (dihydroorotate) or the cofactor (ubiquinone Q6) with Ki' values in the 5-8 nM range. Our results suggest that brequinar sodium inhibits dihydroorotate dehydrogenase by binding to the enzyme at a unique site that is distinct from the dihydroorotate or the ubiquinone-binding site. This binding site appears to be unique to the mammalian enzyme, because brequinar sodium does not inhibit the yeast, Escherichia coli, or Z. oroticum forms of the enzyme.

Dihydroorotate dehydrogenase (DHODH) is the fourth enzyme in the de novo pyrimidine biosynthetic pathway and has been exploited as the target for therapy against proliferative and parasitic diseases. In this study, we report the crystal structures of DHODH from Leishmania major, the species of Leishmania associated with zoonotic cutaneous leishmaniasis, in its apo form and in complex with orotate and fumarate molecules. Both orotate and fumarate were found to bind to the same active site and exploit similar interactions, consistent with a ping-pong mechanism described for class 1A DHODHs. Analysis of LmDHODH structures reveals that rearrangements in the conformation of the catalytic loop have direct influence on the dimeric interface. This is the first structural evidence of a relationship between the dimeric form and the catalytic mechanism. According to our analysis, the high sequence and structural similarity observed among trypanosomatid DHODH suggest that a single strategy of structure-based inhibitor design can be used to validate DHODH as a druggable target against multiple neglected tropical diseases such as Leishmaniasis, Sleeping sickness and Chagas' diseases.

Plasmodium falciparum causes the most deadly form of malaria and accounts for over one million deaths annually. The malaria parasite is unable to salvage pyrimidines and relies on de novo biosynthesis for survival. Dihydroorotate dehydrogenase (DHOD), a mitochondrially localized flavoenzyme, catalyzes the rate-limiting step of this pathway and is therefore an attractive antimalarial chemotherapeutic target. Using a target-based high throughput screen, we have identified a series of potent, species-specific inhibitors of P. falciparum DHOD (pfDHOD) that are also efficacious against three cultured strains (3D7, HB3, and Dd2) of P. falciparum. The primary antimalarial mechanism of action of these compounds was confirmed to be inhibition of pfDHOD through a secondary assay with transgenic malaria parasites, and the structural basis for enzyme inhibition was explored through in silico structure-based docking and site-directed mutagenesis. Compound-mediated cytotoxicity was not observed with human dermal fibroblasts or renal epithelial cells. These data validate pfDHOD as an antimalarial drug target and provide chemical scaffolds with which to begin medicinal chemistry efforts.

Inhibition of dihydroorotate dehydrogenase (DHODH) for P. falciparum potentially represents a new treatment option for malaria, since DHODH catalyzes the rate-limiting step in the pyrimidine biosynthetic pathway and P. falciparum is unable to salvage pyrimidines and must rely on de novo biosynthesis for survival. We report herein the synthesis and structure-activity relationship of a series of 5-(2-methylbenzimidazol-1-yl)-N-alkylthiophene-2-carboxamides that are potent inhibitors against PfDHODH but do not inhibit the human enzyme. On the basis of efficacy observed in three mouse models of malaria, acceptable safety pharmacology risk assessment and safety toxicology profile in rodents, lack of potential drug-drug interactions, acceptable ADME/pharmacokinetic profile, and projected human dose, 5-(4-cyano-2-methyl-1H-benzo[d]imidazol-1-yl)-N-cyclopropylthiophene-2-carboxamide 2q was identified as a potential drug development candidate.

Human dihydroorotate dehydrogenase (HsDHODH) is a key enzyme of pyrimidine <i>de novo</i> biosynthesis pathway. It is located on the mitochondrial inner membrane and contributes to the respiratory chain by shuttling electrons to the ubiquinone pool. We have discovered ascofuranone (<b>1</b>), a natural compound produced by <i>Acremonium sclerotigenum</i>, and its derivatives are a potent class of HsDHODH inhibitors. We conducted a structure-activity relationship study and have identified functional groups of <b>1</b> that are essential for the inhibition of HsDHODH enzymatic activity. Furthermore, the binding mode of <b>1</b> and its derivatives to HsDHODH was demonstrated by co-crystallographic analysis and we show that these inhibitors bind at the ubiquinone binding site. In addition, the cytotoxicities of <b>1</b> and its potent derivatives <b>7</b>, <b>8</b>, and <b>9</b> were studied using human cultured cancer cells. Interestingly, they showed selective and strong cytotoxicity to cancer cells cultured under microenvironment (hypoxia and nutrient-deprived) conditions. The selectivity ratio of <b>8</b> under this microenvironment show the most potent inhibition which was over 1000-fold higher compared to that under normal culture condition. Our studies suggest that under microenvironment conditions, cancer cells heavily depend on the pyrimidine <i>de novo</i> biosynthesis pathway. We also provide the first evidence that <b>1</b> and its derivatives are potential lead candidates for drug development which target the HsDHODH of cancer cells living under a tumor microenvironment.

Plasmodium falciparum, the causative agent of the most deadly form of human malaria, is unable to salvage pyrimidines and must rely on de novo biosynthesis for survival. Dihydroorotate dehydrogenase (DHODH) catalyzes the rate-limiting step in the pyrimidine biosynthetic pathway and represents a potential target for anti-malarial therapy. A high throughput screen and subsequent medicinal chemistry program identified a series of N-alkyl-5-(1H-benzimidazol-1-yl)thiophene-2-carboxamides with low nanomolar in vitro potency against DHODH from P. falciparum, P. vivax, and P. berghei. The compounds were selective for the parasite enzymes over human DHODH, and x-ray structural data on the analog Genz-667348, demonstrated that species selectivity could be attributed to amino acid differences in the inhibitor-binding site. Compounds from this series demonstrated in vitro potency against the 3D7 and Dd2 strains of P. falciparum, good tolerability and oral exposure in the mouse, and ED(50) values in the 4-day murine P. berghei efficacy model of 13-21 mg/kg/day with oral twice-daily dosing. In particular, treatment with Genz-667348 at 100 mg/kg/day resulted in sterile cure. Two recent analogs of Genz-667348 are currently undergoing pilot toxicity testing to determine suitability as clinical development candidates.

Dihydroorotase and dihydroorotate dehydrogenase, two enzymes of the pyrimidine biosynthetic pathway, were purified from Plasmodium berghei to apparent homogeneity. Orotate and a series of 5-substituted derivatives were found to inhibit competitively the purified enzymes from the malaria parasite. The order of effectiveness as inhibitors on pyrimidine ring cleavage reaction for dihydroorotase was 5-fluoro orotate greater than 5-amino orotate, 5-methyl orotate greater than orotate greater than 5-bromo orotate greater than 5-iodo orotate with Ki values of 65, 142, 166, 860, 2200 and greater than 3500 microM, respectively. 5-Fluoro orotate and orotate were the most effective inhibitors for dihydroorotate dehydrogenase. In vitro, 5-fluoro orotate and 5-amino orotate caused 50% inhibition of the growth of P. falciparum at concentrations of 10 nM and 1 microM, respectively. In mice infected with P. berghei, these two orotate analogs at a dose of 25 mg/kg body weight eliminated parasitemia after a 4-day treatment, an effect comparable to that of the same dose of chloroquine. The infected mice treated with 5-fluoro orotate at a lower dose of 2.5 mg/kg had a 95% reduction in parasitemia. The effects of the more potent compounds tested in combination with inhibitors of other enzymes of this pathway on P. falciparum in vitro and P. berghei in vivo are currently under investigation. These results suggest that the pyrimidine biosynthetic pathway in the malarial parasite may be a target for the design of antimalarial drugs.

Dihydroorotate dehydrogenase (DHODH), in the de novo pyrimidine biosynthetic pathway, is the fourth enzyme of pyrimidine synthesis and is used to oxidize dihydroorotate and hence to orotat. We cloned and characterized here the <i>dhod</i> of silkworms, <i>Bombyx mori</i>. The full-length cDNA sequence of <i>dhod</i> is 1339 bp, including an open reading frame (ORF) of 1173 bp that encoded a 390 amino acid protein. And two domains were involved in the Dihydroorotate dehydrogenase amino acid sequence of silkworms, <i>Bombyx mori</i> (BmDHODH), namely a DHO_dh domain and a transmembrane domain in N-termina. The silkworm <i>dhod</i> is expressed throughout development and in nine tissues. Moreover, knockdown of the silkworm <i>dhod</i> gene reduced cell growth and proliferation through G2/M phase cell cycle arrest. Similarly, DHODH inhibitor (leflunomide) also reduced cell growth and proliferation, with a significant decrease of <i>cyclin B</i> and <i>cdk2</i>. DHODH is the fourth enzyme of pyrimidine synthesis, so we also found that leflunomide can inhibit, at least in part, the endomitotic DNA replication in silk glands cells. These findings demonstrate that downregulation of BmDHODH inhibits cell growth and proliferation in silkworm cells, and the endomitotic DNA replication in silk gland cells.

Dihydroorotate dehydrogenase (DHOD) is the fourth enzyme in the de novo pyrimidine biosynthetic pathway and is essential in Trypanosoma cruzi, the parasitic protist causing Chagas' disease. T. cruzi and human DHOD have different biochemical properties, including the electron acceptor capacities and cellular localization, suggesting that T. cruzi DHOD may be a potential chemotherapeutic target against Chagas' disease. Here, we report nucleotide sequence polymorphisms of T. cruzi DHOD genes and the kinetic properties of the recombinant enzymes. T. cruzi Tulahuen strain possesses three DHODgenes: DHOD1 and DHOD2, involved in the pyrimidine biosynthetic (pyr) gene cluster on an 800 and a 1000 kb chromosomal DNA, respectively, and DHOD3, located on an 800 kb DNA. The open reading frames of all three DHOD genes are comprised of 942 bp, and encode proteins of 314 amino acids. The three DHOD genes differ by 26 nucleotides, resulting in replacement of 8 amino acid residues. In contrast, all residues critical for constituting the active site are conserved among the three proteins. Recombinant T. cruzi DHOD1 and DHOD2 expressed in E. coli possess similar enzymatic properties, including optimal pH, optimal temperature, Vmax, and Km for dihydroorotate and fumarate. In contrast, DHOD3 had a higher Vmax and Km for both substrates. Orotate competitively inhibited all three DHOD enzymes to a comparable level. These results suggest that, despite their genetic variations, kinetic properties of the three T. cruziDHODs are conserved. Our findings facilitate further exploitation of T. cruzi DHOD inhibitors, as chemotherapeutic agents against Chagas' disease.

Dihydroorotate dehydrogenase (DHODH) mediates the fourth step of de novo pyrimidine biosynthesis and is a proven drug target for inducing immunosuppression in therapy of human disease as well as a rapidly emerging drug target for treatment of malaria. In Toxoplasma gondii, disruption of the first, fifth, or sixth step of de novo pyrimidine biosynthesis induced uracil auxotrophy. However, previous attempts to generate uracil auxotrophy by genetically deleting the mitochondrion-associated DHODH of T. gondii (TgDHODH) failed. To further address the essentiality of TgDHODH, mutant gene alleles deficient in TgDHODH activity were designed to ablate the enzyme activity. Replacement of the endogenous DHODH gene with catalytically deficient DHODH gene alleles induced uracil auxotrophy. Catalytically deficient TgDHODH localized to the mitochondria, and parasites retained mitochondrial membrane potential. These results show that TgDHODH is essential for the synthesis of pyrimidines and suggest that TgDHODH is required for a second essential function independent of its role in pyrimidine biosynthesis.

Nucleotide biosynthesis pathways have been reported to be essential in some protozoan pathogens. Hence, we evaluated the essentiality of one enzyme in the pyrimidine biosynthetic pathway, dihydroorotate dehydrogenase (DHODH) from the eukaryotic parasite Trypanosoma brucei through gene knockdown studies. RNAi knockdown of DHODH expression in bloodstream form T. brucei did not inhibit growth in normal medium, but profoundly retarded growth in pyrimidine-depleted media or in the presence of the known pyrimidine uptake antagonist 5-fluorouracil (5-FU). These results have significant implications for the development of therapeutics to combat T. brucei infection. Specifically, a combination therapy including a T. brucei-specific DHODH inhibitor plus 5-FU may prove to be an effective therapeutic strategy. We also show that this trypanosomal enzyme is inhibited by known inhibitors of bacterial Class 1A DHODH, in distinction to the sensitivity of DHODH from human and other higher eukaryotes. This selectivity is supported by the crystal structure of the T. brucei enzyme, which is reported here at a resolution of 1.95 A. Additional research, guided by the crystal structure described herein, is needed to identify potent inhibitors of T. brucei DHODH.

Pyrimidine biosynthesis is an attractive drug target in a variety of organisms, including humans and the malaria parasite Plasmodium falciparum. Dihydroorotate dehydrogenase, an enzyme catalyzing the only redox reaction of the pyrimidine biosynthesis pathway, is a well-characterized target for chemotherapeutical intervention. In this study, we have applied SPROUT-LeadOpt, a software package for structure-based drug discovery and lead optimization, to improve the binding of the active metabolite of the anti-inflammatory drug leflunomide to the target cavities of the P. falciparum and human dihydroorotate dehydrogenases. Following synthesis of a library of compounds based upon the SPROUT-optimized molecular scaffolds, a series of inhibitors generally showing good inhibitory activity was obtained, in keeping with the SPROUT-LeadOpt predictions. Furthermore, cocrystal structures of five of these SPROUT-designed inhibitors bound in the ubiquinone binding cavity of the human dihydroorotate dehydrogenase are also analyzed.

Malaria remains one of the most serious global infectious diseases. An important target for antimalarial chemotherapy is the enzyme dihydroorotate dehydrogenase from Plasmodium falciparum (PfDHODH), which is responsible for the conversion of dihydroorotate to orotate in the de novo pyrimidine biosynthetic pathway. In this study, we have designed and synthesized fifteen 7-arylpyrazolo[1,5-a]pyrimidine derivatives using ring bioisosteric replacement and molecular hybridization of functional groups based on the highly active 5-methyl-N-(naphthalen-2-yl)-2-(trifluoromethyl)- [1,2,4]triazolo[1,5-a]pyrimidin-7-amine. The compounds were tested against Plasmodium falciparum, as antimalarials in mice with P. berghei, and as inhibitors of PfDHODH. Thirteen compounds were found to be active against P. falciparum, with IC<sub>50</sub> values ranging from 1.2 ± 0.3 to 92 ± 26 μM in the anti-HRP2 and hypoxanthine assays. Four compounds showed the highest selective index (SI), which is a ratio between cytotoxicity and activity in vitro. The inhibition of PfDHODH showed that compound 30 (R<sub>2</sub> = CH<sub>3</sub>; R<sub>5</sub> = CF<sub>3</sub>; Ar = 7-β-naphthyl) displayed higher and selective inhibitory activity, with IC<sub>50</sub> = 0.16 ± 0.01 μM, followed by 25 (R<sub>2</sub> = CH<sub>3</sub>; R<sub>5</sub> = CH<sub>3</sub>; Ar = 7-β-Naphthyl) and 19 (R<sub>2</sub> = CF<sub>3</sub>; R<sub>5</sub> = CF<sub>3</sub>; Ar = 7-β-naphthyl), with IC<sub>50</sub> = 4 ± 1 μM and 6 ± 1 μM, respectively. The trifluoromethyl group at the 2- or 5-positions of the pyrazolo[1,5-a]pyrimidine ring led to increased drug activity. The docking results agreed with the values obtained from enzymatic assays.

The flavoenzyme dihydroorotate dehydrogenase catalyzes the stereoselective oxidation of (S)-dihydroorotate to orotate in the fourth of the six conserved enzymatic reactions involved in the de novo pyrimidine biosynthetic pathway. Inhibition of pyrimidine metabolism by selectively targeting DHODHs has been exploited in the development of new therapies against cancer, immunological disorders, bacterial and viral infections, and parasitic diseases. Through a chronological narrative, this review summarizes the efforts of the scientific community to achieve our current understanding of structural and biochemical properties of DHODHs. It also attempts to describe the latest advances in medicinal chemistry for therapeutic development based on the selective inhibition of DHODH, including an overview of the experimental techniques used for ligand screening during the process of drug discovery.

The enzyme dihydroorotate dehydrogenase (DHODH) is a flavoenzyme that catalyses the oxidation of dihydroorotate to orotate in the de novo pyrimidine-biosynthesis pathway. In this study, a reproducible protocol for the heterologous expression of active dihydroorotate dehydrogenase from Leishmania (Viannia) braziliensis (LbDHODH) was developed and its crystal structure was determined at 2.12 Å resolution. L. (V.) braziliensis is the species responsible for the mucosal form of leishmaniasis, a neglected disease for which no cure or effective therapy is available. Analyses of sequence, structural and kinetic features classify LbDHODH as a member of the class 1A DHODHs and reveal a very high degree of structural conservation with the previously reported structures of orthologous trypanosomatid enzymes. The relevance of nucleotide-biosynthetic pathways for cell metabolism together with structural and functional differences from the respective host enzyme suggests that inhibition of LbDHODH could be exploited for antileishmanicidal drug development. The present work provides the framework for further integrated in vitro, in silico and in vivo studies as a new tool to evaluate DHODH as a drug target against trypanosomatid-related diseases.

The novel anticancer drug candidate brequinar sodium [DuP 785, NSC 368390, 6-fluoro-2-(2'-fluoro-1,1'-biphenyl-4-yl)-3-methyl-4-quinoline carboxylic acid sodium salt] inhibits dihydroorotate dehydrogenase, the fourth enzyme in the de novo pyrimidine biosynthetic pathway leading to the formation of UMP. Sixty-nine quinoline 4-carboxylic acid analogs were analyzed as inhibitors of L1210 dihydroorotate dehydrogenase. This structure-activity relationship study identified three critical regions of brequinar sodium and its analogs, where specific substitutions are required for the inhibition of the activity of dihydroorotate dehydrogenase. The three principal regions are: (i) the C(2) position where bulky hydrophobic substituents are necessary, (ii) the C(4) position which has a strict requirement for the carboxylic acid and its corresponding salts, and (iii) the benzo portion of the quinoline ring with appropriate substitutions. These results will be useful in the elucidation of the precise nature of the interaction between brequinar sodium and dihydroorotate dehydrogenase.

The pyrimidine biosynthesis pathway in the protozoan pathogen Toxoplasma gondii is essential for parasite growth during infection. To investigate the properties of dihydroorotate dehydrogenase (TgDHOD), the fourth enzyme in the T. gondii pyrimidine pathway, we expressed and purified recombinant TgDHOD. TgDHOD exhibited a specific activity of 84U/mg, a k(cat) of 89s(-1), a K(m)=60μM for l-dihydroorotate, and a K(m)=29μM for decylubiquinone (Q(D)). Quinones lacking or having short isoprenoid side chains yielded lower k(cat)s than Q(D). As expected, fumarate was a poor electron acceptor for this family 2 DHOD. The IC(50)s determined for A77-1726, the active derivative of the human DHOD inhibitor leflunomide, and related compounds MD249 and MD209 were, 91μM, 96μM, and 60μM, respectively. The enzyme was not significantly affected by brequinar or TTFA, known inhibitors of human DHOD, or by atovaquone. DSM190, a known inhibitor of Plasmodium falciparum DHOD, was a poor inhibitor of TgDHOD. TgDHOD exhibits a lengthy 157-residue N-terminal extension, consistent with a potential organellar targeting signal. We constructed C-terminally c-myc tagged TgDHODs to examine subcellular localization of TgDHOD in transgenic parasites expressing the tagged protein. Using both exogenous and endogenous expression strategies, anti-myc fluorescence signal colocalized with antibodies against the mitochondrial marker ATPase. These findings demonstrate that TgDHOD is associated with the parasite's mitochondrion, revealing this organelle as the site of orotate production in T. gondii. The TgDHOD gene appears to be essential because while gene tagging was successful at the TgDHOD gene locus, attempts to delete the TgDHOD gene were not successful in the KU80 background. Collectively, our study suggests that TgDHOD is an excellent target for the development of anti-Toxoplasma drugs.
