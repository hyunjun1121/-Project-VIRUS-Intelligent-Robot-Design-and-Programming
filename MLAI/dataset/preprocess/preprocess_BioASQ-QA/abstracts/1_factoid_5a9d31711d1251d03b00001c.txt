When observed in the electron microscope intact gas vesicles appeared as transparent areas in whole cells of Microcylus aquaticus, whereas vesicles collapsed by centrifugation were not discernible. Within 5 min of suspending cells containing collapsed vesicles in growth medium, small transparent vesicles were detected. By 15 min the average number of vesicles per cell was 15. This number remained relatively constant while the size of the vesicles increased until they attained their maximum diamtere of 100 nm. At this time the vesicles, interpreted as biconical structures, began to elongate presumably due to the synthesis of the cylindrical midsection. Closely correlated with the time at which vesicles began to elongate was the initiation of smaller vesicles which resulted in a doubling of the number of vesicles per cell by 90 min. This evidence coupled with the isolation of a mutant which assembles only the conical portions of the vesicle suggests that assembly occurs in two distinct stages subject to genetic mutation. Protein and ribonucleic acid synthesis, and presumably adenosine triphosphate formation, were required for gas vesicle assembly. In addition, inhibition of protein or ribonucleic acid synthesis resulted in a loss of extant gas vesicles. Over the time course of our study, deoxyribonucleic acid synthesis was not required for gas vesicle assembly or stability.
