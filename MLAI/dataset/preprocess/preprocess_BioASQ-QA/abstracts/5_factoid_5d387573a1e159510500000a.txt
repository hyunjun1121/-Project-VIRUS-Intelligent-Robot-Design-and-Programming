IFNgamma induces cell death in epithelial cells, but the mediator for this death pathway has not been identified. In this study, we find that expression of Bik/Blk/Nbk is increased in human airway epithelial cells (AECs [HAECs]) in response to IFNgamma. Expression of Bik but not mutant BikL61G induces and loss of Bik suppresses IFNgamma-induced cell death in HAECs. IFNgamma treatment and Bik expression increase cathepsin B and D messenger RNA levels and reduce levels of phospho-extracellular regulated kinase 1/2 (ERK1/2) in the nuclei of bik(+/+) compared with bik(-/-) murine AECs. Bik but not BikL61G interacts with and suppresses nuclear translocation of phospho-ERK1/2, and suppression of ERK1/2 activation inhibits IFNgamma- and Bik-induced cell death. Furthermore, after prolonged exposure to allergen, hyperplastic epithelial cells persist longer, and nuclear phospho-ERK is more prevalent in airways of IFNgamma(-/-) or bik(-/-) compared with wild-type mice. These results demonstrate that IFNgamma requires Bik to suppress nuclear localization of phospho-ERK1/2 to channel cell death in AECs.

Autophagy-related gene 5 (ATG5), ATG7, B-lymphoid tyrosine kinase (BLK) and B-cell scaffold protein with ankyrin repeats 1 (BANK1) are involved in B-cell signaling; several genome-wide association studies detected these genes as candidates involved in systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE). We aimed to replicate the association of these genes with SLE in Chinese Han and to search for possible gene-gene interactions. TaqMan single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) genotyping was used to detect rs548234, rs665791 in ATG5, rs11706903 in ATG7, rs2736340 in BLK and rs10516487 in BANK1 in 382 SLE patients and 660 healthy controls. The epistasis effect was analyzed by logistic regression, multifactor dimensionality reduction (MDR) and linear regression analysis. SLE was associated with frequency of rs548234 (P = 0.010; odds ratio [OR] = 1.298), rs2736340 (P = 2.47 × 10<sup>-5</sup> ; OR = 1.574) and rs10516487 (P = 0.002; OR = 0.642). Although no epistasis effects were found among three autophagy-related gene loci or with rs2736340 and rs10516487, BLK and BANK1 had the closest interaction effect on logistic regression analysis (P = 0.013; OR = 1.205), MDR (P < 0.0001), and linear regression analysis (P = 0.0017; R<sup>2</sup> = 0.1806). The risk genotype TT of rs2736340 was associated with decreased messenger RNA level of BLK; BLK transcript level was lower in SLE patients than healthy controls. We confirmed the association of rs548234, rs2736340 and rs10516487 with SLE in Chinese Han and reinforced our hypothesis of their epistasis effect in regulating B-cell signaling in SLE.

The B cell adaptor protein with ankyrin repeats (BANK1) and the B lymphoid tyrosine kinase (BLK) have been genetically associated with autoimmunity. The proteins of these genes interact physically and work in concert during B-cell signaling. Little is know about their interactions with other B-cell signaling molecules or their role in the process. Using yeast two hybrid (Y2H) we sought for factors that interact with BANK1. We found that the molecular switch PLCg2 interacts with BANK1 and that the interaction is promoted by B-cell receptor (BCR) stimulation. We found further that the kinase activity of BLK enhanced BANK1- PLCg2 binding and that the interaction was suppressed upon BLK depletion. Immunoprecipitation and mutational analysis demonstrated that the interaction between BANK1 and PLCg2 was dependent on specific tyrosine and proline residues on the adaptor protein. Our results provide new information important to understand the role of these two genes in basic B-cell physiology and immune-related diseases.

BANK1 and BLK belong to the pleiotropic autoimmune genes; recently, epistasis between BANK1 and BLK was detected in systemic lupus erythematosus. Although BLK has been reproducibly identified as a risk factor in rheumatoid arthritis (RA), reports are conflicting about the contribution of BANK1 to RA susceptibility. To ascertain the real impact of BANK1 on RA genetic susceptibility, we performed a large meta-analysis including our original data and tested for an epistatic interaction between BANK1 and BLK in RA susceptibility. We investigated data for 1,915 RA patients and 1,915 ethnically matched healthy controls genotyped for BANK1 rs10516487 and rs3733197 and BLK rs13277113. The association of each SNP and RA was tested by logistic regression. Multivariate analysis was then used with an interaction term to test for an epistatic interaction between the SNPs in the 2 genes. None of the SNPs tested individually was significantly associated with RA in the genotyped samples. However, we detected an epistatic interaction between BANK1 rs3733197 and BLK rs13277113 (P(interaction)  = 0.037). In individuals carrying the BLK rs13277113 GG genotype, presence of the BANK1 rs3733197 G allele increased the risk of RA (odds ratio 1.21 [95% confidence interval 1.04-1.41], P = 0.015. Combining our results with those of all other studies in a large trans-ethnic meta-analysis revealed an association of the BANK1 rs3733197 G allele and RA (1.11 [1.02-1.21], P = 0.012). This study confirms BANK1 as an RA susceptibility gene and for the first time provides evidence for epistasis between BANK1 and BLK in RA. Our results illustrate the concept of pleiotropic epistatic interaction, suggesting that BANK1 and BLK might play a role in RA pathogenesis.

Altered signalling in B cells is a predominant feature of systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE). The genes BANK1 and BLK were recently described as associated with SLE. BANK1 codes for a B-cell-specific cytoplasmic protein involved in B-cell receptor signalling and BLK codes for an Src tyrosine kinase with important roles in B-cell development. To characterise the role of BANK1 and BLK in SLE, a genetic interaction analysis was performed hypothesising that genetic interactions could reveal functional pathways relevant to disease pathogenesis. The GPAT16 method was used to analyse the gene-gene interactions of BANK1 and BLK. Confocal microscopy was used to investigate co-localisation, and immunoprecipitation was used to verify the physical interaction of BANK1 and BLK. Epistatic interactions between BANK1 and BLK polymorphisms associated with SLE were observed in a discovery set of 279 patients and 515 controls from northern Europe. A meta-analysis with 4399 European individuals confirmed the genetic interactions between BANK1 and BLK. As BANK1 was identified as a binding partner of the Src tyrosine kinase LYN, the possibility that BANK1 and BLK could also show a protein-protein interaction was tested. The co-immunoprecipitation and co-localisation of BLK and BANK1 were demonstrated. In a Daudi cell line and primary naive B cells endogenous binding was enhanced upon B-cell receptor stimulation using anti-IgM antibodies. This study shows a genetic interaction between BANK1 and BLK, and demonstrates that these molecules interact physically. The results have important consequences for the understanding of SLE and other autoimmune diseases and identify a potential new signalling pathway.
