The purpose of this study was to investigate whether thyroid hormone levels have any predictive value for mortality in patients presenting to the emergency department with acute myocardial infarction (AMI). Three groups of patients admitted to the emergency department within the 11-month study period were considered eligible: 95 patients with chest pain and proven AMI, 26 patients with chest pain and no AMI, and 114 patients who served as controls with no evidence of any major disease. Cardiac enzymes and the following thyroid hormones were analyzed and compared between groups, regarding effects of historical and demographic factors: thyrotrophin, free triiodothyronine (FT3), total triiodothyronine (TT3), free thyroxine (FT4), and total thyroxine (TT4). Sixteen patients with AMI (16.8%) died within the study period. Troponin T and creatine kinase-B with an M-type subunit levels were significantly higher in the nonsurvivors when compared with survivors. Survivors in the AMI group had higher TT3, TT4, and lower FT4 levels, while the nonsurvivors in the AMI group had higher thyrotrophin and lower TT3, FT3 and FT4 levels than controls. In the AMI group, the nonsurvivors had lower TT3 and FT3 levels than the survivors. A history of diabetes mellitus and/or angina, TT3, or FT3 was an independent predictor of mortality. TT3 and FT3 appear to be independent prognostic factors in patients with AMI.

Overt thyroid dysfunction, hypothyroidism in particular, may lead to coronary artery disease (CAD). Whether more subtle anomalies of thyroid hormone metabolism influence the progression of CAD remains a matter of speculation. The occurrence of CAD and long-term prognosis in patients without a history of either primary thyroid disease, myocardial infarction, or chronic heart failure is related to serum levels of biologically active free triiodothyronine (fT3). The cohort consisted of 1047 clinically and biochemically euthyroid patients (median age 65.6 y and 69% male) who underwent coronary angiography in our institute for suspected CAD. Lower fT3 levels were predictive of both single-vessel (p = 0.012) and multivessel (p = 0.009) CAD. Through a multivariate logistic regression analysis, fT3 was still linked to the presence of CAD (hazard ratio [HR]: 0.48, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.34-0.68, p < 0.001). After a mean follow-up of 31 months, the survival rate was 95% and total mortality (log-rank 6.75, p = 0.009), as well as cardiac mortality (log-rank 8.26, p = 0.004), was greater among patients with low T3 (fT3 < 2.10 pg/mL) syndrome. At subsequent multivariate Cox regression analysis, the association between low T3 syndrome and survival was maintained (total mortality HR: 1.80, 95% CI: 1.05-3.10, p = 0.034; cardiac mortality HR: 2.58, 95% CI: 1.13-5.93, p = 0.025). In this selected population, fT3 levels were inversely correlated to the presence of CAD and low T3 syndrome conferred an adverse prognosis, even after adjusting for traditional coronary risk factors.

The thyroid hormone system may be downregulated temporarily in patients who are severely ill. This "euthyroid sick syndrome" may be an adaptive response to conserve energy. However, thyroid hormone also has beneficial effects on the cardiovascular system, such as improving cardiac function, reducing systemic vascular resistance, and lowering serum cholesterol levels. We investigated whether thyroid hormone levels obtained at the time of myocardial infarction are associated with subsequent mortality. Serum levels of thyroid hormones (triiodothyronine [T3], reverse T3, free thyroxine [T4], and thyroid-stimulating hormone) were measured in 331 consecutive patients with acute myocardial infarction (mean age [+/- SD], 68 +/- 12 years), from samples obtained at the time of admission. Fifty-three patients (16%) died within 1 year. Ten percent (16 of 165) of patients with reverse T3 levels (an inactive metabolite) >0.41 nmol/L (the median value) died within the first week after myocardial infarction, compared with none of the 166 patients with lower levels (P <0.0004). After 1 year, the corresponding figures were 24% (40 of 165) versus 7.8% (13 of 166; P <0.0001). Reverse T3 levels >0.41 nmol/L were associated with an increased risk of 1-year mortality (hazard ratio = 3.0; 95% confidence interval: 1.4 to 6.3; P = 0.005), independent of age, previous myocardial infarction, prior angina, heart failure, serum creatinine level, and peak serum creatine kinase-MB fraction levels. Determination of reverse T3 levels may be a valuable and simple aid to improve identification of patients with myocardial infarction who are at high risk of subsequent mortality.

To investigate the association between low free triiodothyronine (fT3) levels and the severity and prognosis of patients with acute myocardial infarction. A total of 501 patients with acute myocardial infarctions were enrolled in our study. The circulating levels of thyroid hormones and clinical parameters were assayed. The patients were categorized into either the low fT3 group or the normal fT3 group according to the fT3 level on admission. All patients underwent a follow-up for 10±2 months for mortality from any cause and the occurrence of any adverse major cardiac events (MACE). There were 171 patients in the low fT3 group (fT3<3.5 pmol/L) and 330 patients in the normal fT3 group (≥3.5 pmol/L). During the follow-up period, 33 patients died (6.6%) and the overall survival rates were 86.0% and 97.3% in patients with a low fT3 level and a normal fT3 level, respectively. The rates of MACE were 66.7% and 45.5% in the patients with and those without low fT3 levels, respectively. Using a multivariable Cox proportional hazards model, the fT3 level was found to be the most important predictor of cumulative death and MACE (hazard ratio [HR] for death: 0.142, p<0.001 and HR for major adverse cardiac events: 0.748, p=0.007). A Kaplan-Meier analysis revealed that those patients with low fT3 levels had higher rates of MACE and death. A low fT3 level, a common phenomenon in patients with acute myocardial infarctions, is a strong predictor of short-term and long-term poor prognoses in patients with acute myocardial infarctions.

Concomitant thyroid and heart disease are frequently encountered in clinical practice. There are many studies evaluating thyroid function in acute and critical conditions. Information on thyroid dysfunction in ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) is limited; its correlation with short and long-term outcome is not fully known. Four hundred and fifty seven patients diagnosed with STEMI in our emergency department were included in the study. Patients were divided into two groups: patients with normal thyroid function (euthyroid) and patients with thyroid dysfunction. STEMI was diagnosed with 12 derivation surface electrocardiogram. Thyroid hormone levels (TSH, free T3 and free T4) were measured. Patients with other acute coronary syndromes and endocrine pathologies except diabetes mellitus were excluded. Two patient groups were compared in terms of in-hospital and long-term outcome. Out of 457, 72 (15%) patients with thyroid dysfunction were detected. The other patients were euthyroid and constituted the control group. In-hospital cardiogenic shock (15% vs. 3% in the control group; p < 0.01) and death (7% vs. 1% in the control group; p < 0.01) were more frequently observed in the thyroid dysfunction group. In the subgroup analysis, it was observed that patients with sick euthyroid syndrome have the poorest outcome. Other markers for poor outcome were anemia and renal failure. Thyroid dysfunction, particularly sick euthyroid syndrome, was found to be related to in-hospital and long term mortality in patients with STEMI undergoing primary percutaneous intervention.
