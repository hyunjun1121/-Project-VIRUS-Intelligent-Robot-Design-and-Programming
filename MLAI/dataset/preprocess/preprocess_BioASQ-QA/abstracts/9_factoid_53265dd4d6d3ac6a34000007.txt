The cardiovascular system is an important target for thyroid hormones. The present study evaluates the changes affecting thyroid hormone metabolism during and 6 days after coronary artery bypass and their relationship with the post-operative outcome of the patients. Thirty-three patients were enrolled in the study; their thyroid hormone profiles were determined at 13 sampling points during surgery and for 6 days afterwards. Serum total tri-iodothyronine (T3) and free T3 (FT3) concentrations decreased significantly after surgery (P<0.001) and they remained significantly low until the end of the study. Free thyroxine (FT4) and T4 declined significantly immediately after surgery (P<0.05 for FT4, P<0.001 for T4) but they returned to baseline values (24 h and 96 h post-surgery respectively). Serum reverse T3 increased remarkably 36 h after surgery (P<0.001) and remained significantly higher than the baseline value throughout the study. A relevant finding was that the days of post-operative hospitalization (10+/-3 days, means+/-S.D.) was inversely correlated with the slope of the recovery of T3 concentration (P<0.001) or with the area under the plasma curves of T3 (P=0.024, time range 72-144 h) and the FT3/FT4 ratio (P=0.037, time range 72-144 h) during the post-operative period. Our data suggest a prolonged reduction of T4 to T3 conversion in patients undergoing cardiac surgery and indicate that the recovery period is the most critical in the evaluation of a possibly successful approach for T3 substitutive therapy.

Despite improved perioperative management, atrial fibrillation (AF) after coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) remains a relevant clinical problem, whose pathogenetic mechanisms remain incompletely explained. A reduced incidence of postoperative AF has been described in CABG patients receiving IV tri-iodothyronine (T3). This study was designed to define the role of thyroid metabolism on the genesis of postoperative AF. Free T3 (fT3), free thyroxine (fT4), and thyroid stimulating hormone were assayed at admission in 107 consecutive patients undergoing isolated CABG surgery. Patients with thyroid disease or taking drugs known to interfere with thyroid function were excluded. A preoperative rhythm other than sinus rhythm was considered an exclusion criterion. Thirty-three patients (30.8%) had postoperative AF. An older age (P=0.03), no therapy with beta-blockers (P=0.08), chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (P=0.08), lower left ventricle ejection fraction (P=0.09) and lower fT3 concentration (P=0.001), were univariate predictors of postoperative AF. On multivariate analysis, low fT3 concentration and lack of beta-blocking therapy were independently related with the development of postoperative AF (odds ratio, OR, 4.425; 95% confidence interval, CI, 1.745-11.235; P=0.001 and OR 3.107; 95% CI 1.087-8.875; P=0.03, respectively). Postoperative AF significantly prolonged postoperative hospital stay (P=0.002). Low basal fT3 concentration can reliably predict the occurrence of postoperative AF in CABG patients.

The purpose of this study was to evaluate serum triiodothyronine levels as a trigger of postoperative atrial fibrillation (AF) in elderly patients undergoing cardiac surgery and to study the possible association of serum triiodothyronine levels with preoperative and postoperative hemodynamics. Prospective study. University hospital. Forty-six consecutive nonemergency patients 65 years or older undergoing cardiac surgery during 1999 to 2000 in Tampere University Hospital, Tampere, Finland. Free serum T3 concentration was used as a measure of serum triiodothyronine levels. Samples were taken preoperatively, on the fourth postoperative day, and at the 3-month follow-up. The hemodynamic state of the patients was estimated by whole-body impedance cardiography preoperatively, during the intensive care unit period, daily until the fourth postoperative day, and at the 3-month follow-up. AF occurred in 43% of the patients. The patients in the AF group had significantly more grafts (3.9 v 3.1, p = 0.02), and there was a small difference in age between the AF and non-AF groups (73 years v 69 years, p = 0.06). The free T3 concentration on the fourth postoperative day was significantly lower in the AF group (3.5 nmol/L v 4.6 nmol/L, p = 0.04). In logistic regression analysis, the independent predictors of AF were age, number of grafts, and serum free T3 concentration on the fourth postoperative day. In the group with low T3 concentration, the cardiac index was lower (1.4 v 1.8, p = 0.05) and the systemic vascular resistance index was higher (4,064 v 2,969, p = 0.04) but only immediately after the operation. Although the AF mostly appeared during the second to fourth postoperative days, there were no longer any differences in the hemodynamic state at that time. In a group of elderly patients undergoing cardiac surgery, there was a strong association between a postoperative decrease of serum triiodothyronine levels and atrial fibrillation. The decrease of serum triiodothyronine levels was related to the changes of hemodynamic parameters only in the immediate postoperative period.

Thyroid hormones are essential for the correct functioning of the entire body. Diagnosis of thyroid disorders in patients after heart transplant in the early post-operative period and the implementation of correct treatment may prevent life-threatening complications. The aim of the study was to determine whether the complicated postoperative course (ie, hypothyroidism, hyperthyroidism or low fT3 syndrome) in patients in the first month after heart transplantation was connected with impaired thyroid hormone management. The analysis encompassed material from 98 patients treated with heart transplantation between February 9, 2004 and January 4, 2010. Hyperthyroidism was diagnosed in 21 patients (19M/2F, 52±7 years of age), hypothyroidism in was diagnosed in 13 patients (10M/3F, 46±12 years old), and low fT3 syndrome was diagnosed in 18 patients (14M/4F, 43±12 years old). Patients with fT3 syndrome had the highest mortality (16.7%, NS), highest incidence of acute rejection (38.9%, NS), highest number of reoperations (27.8%, NS), and highest incidence of bacterial (16.7%, NS) and fungal infections (11.1%, NS). Cytomegaloviral infections occurred most frequently in patients with hyperthyroidism (23.8%, NS). Patients with hypothyroidism (84.6%, NS) were hospitalized the longest (>30 days), had the highest tendency towards pleural effusion (23.1%, NS) and pericardial effusion with tamponade (15.5%, NS), bradycardia with pacemaker (15.4%, NS) and renal failure requiring hemodiafiltration (15.4%, NS) (Table 1). 1. The thyroid test panel should be performed in all patients in the early post-heart transplant period. 2. The diagnosis of thyroid disorders should be immediately followed by correct treatment aimed at restoring the euthyroid state, with a view to facilitate recovery and rehabilitation as well as to shorten the hospitalization time, thereby lowering treatment costs.<br />

To analyze the relationship between early spontaneous cardioversion of atrial fibrillation (AF) and thyroid hormone metabolism after mitral replacement in patients with rheumatic heart disease, and explore the treatment strategy of early spontaneous cardioversion after mitral valve replacement. According to the occurrence of cardioversion, 138 patients with mitral valve replacement were divided into conversion group and non-conversion group, and based on the duration of sinus rhythm, the patients in conversion group were divided into < 3 days group and > 3 days group. Triiodothyronine (T3) was detected by radioimmunoassay in all the patients. T3 metabolism decreased significantly after the operation in all the patients. Early spontaneous cardioversion of AF occurred 2 h after the operation in 52 cases (37.7%), and 28 (20.3%) of the cases had a duration of sinus rhythm longer than 3 days. T3 was significantly decreased in conversion group and non-conversion group by 44.5% and 58.7% at 2 h, by 40.0% and 52.4% at 24 h and by 28.6% and 37.7% at 72 h after the operation, respectively. The levels of T3 in conversion group was significantly higher than the levels in non-conversion group, and showed no significant variation with the duration of sinus rhythm. Enhancement of T3 levels after mitral valve replacement may increase the probability of early spontaneous cardioversion of AF, but can not affect the duration of sinus rhythm. This finding supports the supplementation of T3 perioperatively in patients undergoing cardiac surgeries.

Cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB) is associated with thyroid hormone changes consistent with euthyroid sick syndrome. Similar changes have been observed after general surgical operations. Thyroid hormone changes and their association with global oxygen consumption were studied in low-risk patients undergoing coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) with and without CPB. Fifty-two patients undergoing primary CABG by the same surgeon were randomised into either on-pump (ONCAB, n=26) or off-pump (OPCAB, n=26) groups. Thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH), free thyroxine (fT4) and free triiodothyronine (fT3) levels were measured at sequential time-points using chemiluminescence assays. Global oxygen consumption was measured at sequential time-points using a continuous cardiac output Swan-Ganz catheter. In both groups TSH and fT4 remained within normal range throughout the study. There was a similar and progressive decline in fT3 levels with no significant difference between the groups over time (p=0.42). Mean fT3 levels at 24h were below the normal range and significantly lower than baseline values (ONCAB, 3.3+/-0.69 pmol/L vs 5.1+/-0.41 pmol/L, p<0.001; OPCAB, 3.3+/-0.51 pmol/L vs 5.0+/-0.46 pmol/L, p<0.001). There was a significant inverse relationship between fT3 levels and global oxygen consumption. Off-pump surgery is associated with thyroid hormone changes similar to conventional surgical revascularisation. The data suggest that further studies into T3 administration during OPCAB may be warranted.

Alterations in serum concentrations of total triiodothyronine (TT3), total thyroxine (TT4), and thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) frequently occur in patients with nonthyroidal illnesses. These changes correlate with the severity of the illness and the prognosis. In this study, 44 patients undergoing a cardiovascular operation had significant declines in serum TT3 and TT4 levels during cardiopulmonary bypass and thereafter. Serum TT3 and TT4 concentrations reached their nadir at 30 minutes after the start of cardiopulmonary bypass with values (mean +/- standard error of the mean) of 0.77 +/- 0.12 nmol/L (50.4 +/- 7.6 ng/dL) and 68.2 +/- 10.2 nmol/L (5.30 +/- 0.79 micrograms/dL), respectively. The mean serum concentrations of TSH and TT4 returned to preoperative levels by the sixth day after operation, whereas TT3 levels remained low throughout the study period. The patients whose recovery was uneventful had higher serum TT3, TT4, and TSH levels than those who had complications or died. The trend toward recovery was initiated by a sharp increase in the serum TSH level and increases in serum TT3 and TT4 concentrations on the fourth day after operation. Patients with complications either did not show these changes or had only a transient increase in TT3 and TT4 levels. All of the patients had a normal serum free T4 level before anesthesia. Those with an uneventful recovery had a higher serum free T4 level on the sixth day after operation than those with complications. Two patients in the latter group had serum free T4 levels less than normal at that time.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)

Our aim was to determine whether the changes in thyroid function after open-heart surgery in neonates depend on the postoperative course. Twenty neonates undergoing open-heart surgery for congenital heart disease were prospectively studied in the cardiac intensive care unit of a university-affiliated children's hospital. The patients were divided into two groups by level of inotropic support (high or mild). The groups were similar in age, bypass time and ultrafiltration volume. In both groups, there was a significant reduction in levels of thyroid-stimulating hormone and FT4 at 24 h postoperatively. However, in the high inotropic support group, FT4 was lower for a longer time. This group also had a significantly higher score on The Pediatric Risk of Mortality (PRISM; P < 0.042) and a longer duration of ventilation (P < 0.014). Neonates after open-heart surgery undergo changes in thyroid function characteristic of euthyroid sick syndrome. The degree of hypothyroxinemia may be related to the severity of illness and the postoperative course.

Some studies have proposed that subclinical hypothyroidism (SCH) has adverse effects on the cardiovascular system, but little is known about the effect on patients undergoing cardiovascular operations. We examined the influence of preoperative SCH on postoperative outcome in patients undergoing coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG). Among patients who underwent CABG between July 2005 and June 2007 at Seoul National University Bundang Hospital, 224 with normal thyroid function and 36 with SCH were enrolled. Preoperative risks and postoperative outcomes were evaluated prospectively without thyroid hormone replacement. There were no significant differences in primary outcomes (major adverse cardiovascular events) and secondary outcomes such as wound problems, mediastinitis, leg infection, respiratory complications, delirium, or reoperation during the same hospitalization. However, patients with SCH had a higher incidence of postoperative atrial fibrillation than those with normal thyroid function after adjustment for age, gender, body mass index, and other independent variables such as emergency operation, the use of cardiopulmonary bypass, combined valvular operation, preoperative creatinine levels, left ventricular systolic dysfunction, and nonuse of beta-blockers (45.5% vs 29%; odds ratio, 2.552; 95% confidence interval, 1.117 to 5.830; p = 0.026). SCH appears to influence the postoperative outcome for patients by increasing the development of postoperative atrial fibrillation. However, it is still unproven whether preoperative thyroxine replacement therapy for patients with SCH might prevent postoperative atrial fibrillation after CABG.
