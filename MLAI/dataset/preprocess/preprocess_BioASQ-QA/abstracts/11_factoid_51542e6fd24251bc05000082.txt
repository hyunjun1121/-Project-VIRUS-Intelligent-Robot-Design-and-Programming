Stevens-Johnson syndrome (SJS) and toxic epidermal necrolysis (TEN) are rare but severe cutaneous adverse drug reactions, which can be caused by a certain number of specific drugs among which is carbamazepine, an antiepileptic agent. A very strong association of carbamazepine-induced SJS with HLA-B*1502 has recently been described in the Han Chinese population. Here in, we report preliminary results from a European study (RegiSCAR) of 12 carbamazepine-induced SJS/TEN cases (nine French and three German). Among these only four had a HLA-B*1502 allele. Remarkably, these four patients had an Asian ancestry, whereas the others did not as far as we have ascertained. This shows that although the HLA region may contain important genes for SJS, the HLA-B*1502 allele is not a universal marker for this disease and that ethnicity matters.

The purpose of this study is to examine the association of HLA-B*1502 allele with CBZ-induced SJS/TEN in the mainland Han Chinese population. HLA-B*1502 genotyping with sequence-specific primer polymerase chain reaction (PCR-SSP) and PCR-sequencing based typing (PCR-SBT) was performed on 17 CBZ-induced SJS/TEN patients, 21 CBZ-tolerant controls, and 185 healthy controls recruited during 2008-2010. HLA-B*1502 allele was present in 94.1% (16/17) of CBZ-SJS/TEN patients, 9.5% (2/21) of CBZ-tolerant patients, and 9.2% (17/185) of healthy controls. The risk of CBZ-induced SJS/TEN was significantly higher (P < 0.01) in the patients with HLA-B*1502. One CBZ-induced SJS patient tested negative for HLA-B*1502, and the test result showed HLA-B*3503/B*4601. We found a strong association between HLA-B*1502 and CBZ-induced SJS/TEN in the Han Chinese population from central and northern China. Combined with previous studies of the southern Han Chinese subpopulation, our results suggest that HLA-B*1502 is strongly associated with CBZ-induced SJS/TEN in the whole Han Chinese population.

Stevens-Johnson syndrome and the related disease toxic epidermal necrolysis are life-threatening reactions of the skin to particular types of medication. Here we show that there is a strong association in Han Chinese between a genetic marker, the human leukocyte antigen HLA-B*1502, and Stevens-Johnson syndrome induced by carbamazepine, a drug commonly prescribed for the treatment of seizures. It should be possible to exploit this association in a highly reliable test to predict severe adverse reaction, as well as for investigation of the pathogenesis of Stevens-Johnson syndrome.

Stevens-Johnson Syndrome (SJS) and toxic epidermal necrolysis are severe cutaneous reactions caused by certain drugs, including antiepileptic carbamazepine. A strong association has been reported between human leucocyte antigen (HLA)-B*1502 and carbamazepine-induced SJS in Han Chinese patients. European studies suggested that HLA-B*1502 is not a universal marker but is ethnicity-specific for Asians. To study the association between HLA-B*1502 and carbamazepine-induced SJS in Indian patients. Eight individuals who fulfilled the diagnostic criteria of SJS induced by carbamazepine were identified and HLA-B molecular typing was performed. HLA-B genotyping was carried out by polymerase chain reaction using sequence-specific primers. Out of eight patients studied for genotype, six patients were found to have the HLA-B*1502 allele. This study suggests an association between HLA-B*1502 and carbamazepine-induced SJS in Indian patients.

Carbamazepine (CBZ) is frequently used for treating epilepsy, but this drug causes cutaneous adverse drug reactions (cADRs) that may range from mild to severe. It is reported recently that the human leukocyte antigen HLA-B*1502 is associated with Stevens-Johnson syndrome (SJS) induced by CBZ in Han Chinese. We examined HLA class I in 15 Japanese patients who fulfilled the diagnostic criteria for CBZ-induced cADRs (mild in 10 and severe = SJS in 5). HLA-B*1518, HLA-B*5901 and HLA-C*0704 alleles showed higher relative risks (above 10.0) for severe cADRs. The haplotype (HLA-A*2402-B*5901-C*0102) had high relative risk (16.09) for severe cADRs. In patients with severe cADRs, frequencies of HLA-A*1101, HLA-A*3303, HLA-B*1501, HLA-B*4403, HLA-B*5101, HLA-B*5201, HLA-C*0702, and HLA-C*1202 alleles are relatively lower than in the Japanese population. These data may suggest that HLA-B*5901 is one of the candidate markers for CBZ-induced SJS in Japanese.

Lamotrigine (LTG) is a commonly used antiepileptic drug. However, the use of LTG is limited because of its cutaneous adverse drug reactions (cADRs) ranging from mild maculopapular eruption (MPE) to severe Stevens-Johnson syndrome (SJS) and toxic epidermal necrolysis (TEN). A strong association between HLA-B*1502 and carbamazepine-induced SJS/TEN has been identified in Chinese and Thai. Although three of seven cases with HLA-B*1502 have been reported in LTG-induced SJS/TEN so far, the relationship between HLA-B*1502 and LTG-induced SJS/TEN needs further investigation. It is also unclear whether there is a specific genetic marker associated with LTG-induced MPE in Chinese. In this study, we genotyped 43 Han Chinese patients treated with LTG (14 cases with LTG-induced cADRs and 29 LTG-tolerant controls), using PCR-SSP for HLA-B*1502 testing and low-resolution genotyping, as well as sequencing for four-digit genotyping. The two cases with SJS were negative for HLA-B*1502, with B1301/1301 and 4601/5610, respectively. Combining the data with previous studies, there was no significant difference in the frequency of subjects with HLA-B*1502 between the LTG-induced SJS/TEN group and the LTG-tolerant group (p = 0.08, OR 4.23, 95% CI 0.94-18.97). In the MPE group, only one was positive for HLA-B*1502. There was no significant difference in the frequency of a specific HLA-B allele between the MPE group and the LTG-tolerant group either. In this study, no significant association between HLA-B*1502 and LTG-induced SJS or MPE was found. Given the small sample size and only HLA-B locus genotyping, further large-scale studies are required to explore genetic associations with LTG-induced cADRs.

Carbamazepine (CBZ) has been reported as the most common culprit drug for Stevens-Johnson syndrome (SJS) and toxic epidermal necrolysis (TEN) in several Asian countries including Thailand. A strong association between HLA-B*1502 and CBZ-induced SJS/TEN has been reported in Han Chinese but not in Caucasian and Japanese populations. A case-control study was conducted to determine whether HLA-B*1502 is a valid pharmacogenetic test for SJS/TEN caused by CBZ in a Thai population. Among 42 CBZ-induced patients with SJS/TEN, 37 (88.10%) patients carried the HLA-B*1502 while only 5 (11.90%) of the CBZ-tolerant controls had this allele. The risk of CBZ-induced SJS/TEN was significantly higher in the patients with HLA-B*1502, with an odds ratio (OR) of 54.76 [95% confidence interval (CI) 14.62-205.13, p = 2.89 x 10(-12)]. The sensitivity and specificity of HLA-B*1502 for prediction of CBZ-induced SJS/TEN were 88.10%. By assuming a 0.27% as a prevalence rate of CBZ-induced SJS/TEN in a Thai population, the positive predictive value (PPV) and negative predictive value (NPV) of the HLA-B*1502 were 1.92% and 99.96%. Results from this study suggest that HLA-B*1502 may be a useful pharmacogenetic test for screening Thai individuals who may be at risk for CBZ-induced SJS and TEN.

Previous studies found a strong association between HLA-B*1502 and carbamazepine (CBZ)-induced Stevens-Johnson syndrome (SJS) in Han Chinese, but not in Caucasian populations. Even in Han Chinese, the HLA-B*1502 was not associated with CBZ-induced maculopapular eruptions (MPE). This study seeks to identify whether HLA-B*1502 is associated with CBZ- or phenytoin (PHT)-induced SJS or MPE in a Thai population. Eighty-one Thai epileptic patients between 1994 and 2007 from the Chulalongkorn Comprehensive Epilepsy Program were recruited. Thirty-one subjects had antiepileptic drug (AED)-induced SJS or MPE (6 CBZ-SJS, 4 PHT-SJS, 9 CBZ-MPE, 12 PHT-MPE), and 50 were AED-tolerant controls. For the first time, a strong association between HLA-B*1502 and PHT-induced SJS was found (p = 0.005). A strong association was also found between the HLA-B*1502 and CBZ-induced SJS (p = 0.0005), making Thai the first non-Chinese population demonstrating such an association. Some patients, who were HLA-B*1502 and suffered from CBZ-induced SJS, could be tolerant to PHT and vice versa. This suggests that HLA-B*1502 may be a common attribute required for a Thai patient to develop SJS from these two AEDs; other different elements, however, are also needed for each AED. In addition, no association between HLA-B alleles and CBZ- or PHT-induced MPE was found. CBZ- and PHT-induced SJS, but not MPE, is associated with HLA-B*1502 allele in Thai population.

Recent study demonstrated that HLA-B*1502 was a common risk allele in aromatic antiepileptic drugs (AEDs) induced Stevens-Johnson syndrome and toxic epidermal necrolysis in Han Chinese. However, the association of AEDs-induced mild maculopapular eruption (MPE) with HLA-B*1502 remains unclear until recently. In the present study, we conducted a pilot study to detect a possible association of oxcarbazepine (OXC)-induced MPE with HLA-B*1502 allele in Chinese Han population. We enrolled 90 subjects involving 9 patients with OXC-induced MPE and two groups of controls, 9 OXC-tolerant and 72 normal controls. High-resolution HLA genotyping was performed by specific kit. The results of HLA genotyping are expressed as positive or negative for HLA-B*1502 allele. Differences in genotype frequencies between groups were assessed by the Fisher's exact test. Four cases were detected as positive for HLA-B*1502 amongst 9 patients. However, only 1 subject was positive amongst 9 tolerant controls, and 6 subjects were positive amongst 72 normal controls. The difference in HLA-B*1502 allele frequencies between the MPE group and normal controls was statistically significant (OR: 8.8; 95% CI: 1.853-41.790; P=0.011). In addition, we also observed an increased frequency of HLA-B*1502 allele in patients (44.44%) compared with tolerant controls (11.11%), although it failed to reach statistical significance (P=0.294). Our findings indicate that HLA-B*1502 allele may contribute to the genetic susceptibility to OXC-induced MPE in Chinese Han population. In order to safer AEDs use, we recommend that HLA-B*1502 allele should be tested for patients with OXC-induced MPE before changing to other AEDs, and AEDs with similar chemical structure should be avoided in individuals who test positive for HLA-B*1502 allele. It should be pointed out that, however, our results may well be just by chance owing to the small sample size and should be further confirmed in future studies.

Recently, the USA FDA has made a labeling change to the drug information contained in carbamazepine. Owing to recent data implicating the HLA allele B*1502 as a marker for carbamazepine-induced Stevens-Johnson syndrome and toxic epidermal necrolysis in Han Chinese, the FDA recommends genotyping all Asians for the allele. This allele is seen in high frequency in many Asian populations other than Han Chinese, but there are few data on whether the allele is a marker for this severe outcome in anyone other than Han Chinese. In fact, the association has not been found in Caucasian patients. We review the data that prompted this recommendation, list data for other ethnic groups, both Asian and non-Asian, and briefly discuss the implication of this recommendation for clinical practice.

Carbamazepine (CBZ) is the most frequent culprit drug for severe cutaneous adverse drug reactions (ADR), such as Stevens-Johnson syndrome (SJS), toxic epidermal necrolysis (TEN) and drug-induced hypersensitivity syndrome (DIHS). A strong association between human leukocyte antigen (HLA)-B*1502 and CBZ-induced SJS/TEN has been reported in Han Chinese, Thai, Malaysian and Indian populations, but not in Caucasian or Japanese populations. Recent studies showed an association between HLA-A*3101 and CBZ-induced ADR in Caucasian and Japanese populations. We conducted a case-control study to determine HLA genotyping of patients with CBZ-induced ADR in a Japanese population. Fifteen patients with CBZ-induced ADR and 33 subjects who had taken CBZ for more than 3 months without evidence of any ADR as a control were enrolled. In addition, the results of a CBZ-induced lymphocyte stimulation test were compared between the groups. A strong association was found between HLA-A31 and CBZ-induced ADR (P < 0.001), and a weak association was found between HLA-A11 and HLA-B51 with CBZ-induced ADR. No HLA-B*1502 was found in either patients or control subjects. The mean CBZ-induced lymphocyte stimulation index was significantly high in patients with CBZ-induced ADR compared with CBZ-tolerant patients (P < 0.001); however, no significant difference was seen between HLA-A31-positive subjects and HLA-A31-negative subjects in either group. These findings suggest that HLA-A31 is strongly associated with CBZ-induced ADR in the Japanese, but does not determine CBZ-induced lymphocyte proliferation.
