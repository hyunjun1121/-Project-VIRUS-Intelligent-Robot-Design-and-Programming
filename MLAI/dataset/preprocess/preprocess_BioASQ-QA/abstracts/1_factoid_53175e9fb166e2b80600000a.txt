Molecular pathogenesis of gastrointestinal polyposis in Peutz-Jegher's syndrome (PJS) has been linked to the loss-of-function mutation of LKB1. Recent functional genetic studies have pointed out that LKB1 plays a physiological role in controlling the Wnt-signaling pathway and activation of the pathway as a consequence of LKB1 haploinsufficiency might be responsible for the development of harmatomatous polyps. This study aimed to look for immunohistochemical evidence of Wnt-signaling activation in PJS polyps. Beta-catenin immunohistochemistry patterns were evaluated in gastrointestinal polyps from five cases of PJS. All patients were also evaluated for germline mutations of LKB1 and somatic mutations of beta-catenin in the polyps. Four of the five cases had germline mutations of LKB1, including two novel mutations, a one-base insertion at codon 53 and a large deletion encompassing exon 3 (codon 136-155). PJS polyps from all patients showed generalized membrane and cytoplasmic localizations of beta-catenin along the mucosal endothelium. Polyps from two cases with LKB1 mutations revealed moderate-intensity nuclear staining in approximately 20 and 70% of the polyps. The study offers additional evidence of Wnt-signaling activation in PJS polyp development at the tissue level, although the degree of up-regulation was not as high as has been found in Wnt-associated neoplasms.
