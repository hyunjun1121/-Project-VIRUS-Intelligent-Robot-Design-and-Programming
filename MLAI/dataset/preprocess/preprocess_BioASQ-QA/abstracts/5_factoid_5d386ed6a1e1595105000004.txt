We recently reported the association of the allele coding for Arg at the position 196 (196R: nucleotide [nt] 587G) of tumor necrosis factor receptor 2 (TNFR2, TNF-R75) with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) in Japanese. In the present study, we completed the variation screening of the entire coding region of TNFR2. Three new single nucleotide polymorphisms within the coding sequence (cSNPs), as well as several variations within the promoter, introns and 3'-untranslated region (3' UTR), were identified. Among the new SNPs, nt168G, a synonymous substitution (K56K), was in tight linkage disequilibrium with nt587G. Two other cSNPs, nt543 (C-->T) (P181P) and nt694 (G-->A) (E232K), were not significantly associated with SLE. Thus, among the non-synonymous cSNPs, only nt587 (T-->G) (M196R) was found to be significantly associated with SLE in Japanese.

A number of studies reported associations of HLA-DRB1, TNFalpha (TNF) promoter and TNF receptor II (TNFR2, TNFRSF1B) polymorphisms with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), however, the results have often been inconsistent. Such lack of consistency could partly derive from the population admixture involved in the case-control study. To avoid such a problem, polymorphisms in these genes were analyzed using transmission disequilibrium test (TDT) in Caucasian SLE families. Ninety-one Caucasian SLE family samples recruited in southern California were analyzed for the association with HLA-DRB1, TNF promoter positions at -1031, -863, -857 and -308, and TNFR2-196M/R polymorphisms. Significant transmission was observed for HLA-DRB1*1501, but not for HLA-DRB1*0301, nor for TNF haplotype that codes for -308A. Interestingly, TNF haplotype coding for -1031C, -863A, -857C showed a tendency of preferential nontransmission in the patients without lupus nephritis and in those with malar rash. No transmission distortion was observed for TNFR2-196R allele. These findings confirmed the association of HLA-DRB1*1501, but did not replicate that of the HLA-DRB1*0301, TNFA-308A and TNFR2-196R with SLE in this population. In addition, a possible disease-protective role for TNF haplotype coding for -1031C, -863A, -857C was suggested.

A polymorphism in high-affinity receptor of TNF (TNFR2) gene, Met196Arg, was reported to be associated with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) in Japanese, whereas the association could not be found in Europeans at all and this represents an apparent discrepancy. The association, then, should be tested in other populations to clarify the possible involvement, if any, of the TNFR2 polymorphism in SLE or other related autoimmune diseases. The purposes of this study were to examine the TNFR2 polymorphism in Japanese patients with SLE and to investigate its association with other autoimmune diseases accompanied by vasculitis, mixed connective tissue disease, Buerger's disease, and Takayasu's arteritis. We found no association at all between the TNFR2 polymorphism and any autoimmune diseases including SLE in Japanese.

Multiple genetic as well as environmental factors are considered to be involved in the development of systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE). A number of previous studies have suggested a possible role for tumor necrosis factor (TNF) in the pathogenesis of SLE. In addition, one of the candidate loci suggested by the genome-wide linkage analysis corresponds to the chromosomal position encompassing the TNF receptor 2 gene (TNFR2). The purpose of this study was to analyze the polymorphism of TNFR2 and its possible association with the susceptibility to SLE, using the case-control association analysis. Polymorphism screening of the exons containing previously reported nonsynonymous base substitutions was carried out by the polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-single strand conformation polymorphism (SSCP) method, using genomic DNA from 81 Japanese patients with SLE and 207 healthy individuals. Two alleles were present in exon 6, coding for methionine (196M) and arginine (196R) at position 196. 30 of 81 patients (37.0%) with SLE were positive for the 196R allele, which was significantly more frequent compared with 39 of 207 healthy individuals (18.8%) (chi2=10.6, df=l, P=0.001, odds ratio=2.53, 95% CI: 1.45-4.43). Genotype analysis revealed that the presence of one 196R allele was sufficient for rendering susceptibility. The association of 196R allele with SLE was independent from that of HLA-DRB1*1501. In conclusion, the TNFR2 196R allele was found to be significantly associated with the susceptibility to SLE in the Japanese population. Further population and functional studies will be of particular importance to establish TNFR2 as one of the susceptibility genes to SLE.

The role of pro-inflammatory cytokines in systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) remains somewhat controversial. Several studies have shown increased production of TNF alpha and IL-6 in patients with SLE. Increased production of IL-6, TNF alpha, and IL-1 soluble receptors have also been reported. This finding is provocative because the soluble receptors have the capacity to act as antagonists. Several other inflammatory disorders are also associated with increased production of soluble TNF alpha receptors suggesting that this may be a general compensatory mechanism designed to down-regulate inflammation. The recent identification of an SLE disease susceptibility locus near the TNFR2 locus (TNFR p75) suggested the hypothesis that genetically driven differences in soluble TNFR2 production could play a role in the genetic susceptibility to SLE. We therefore characterized the frequency of a genetic polymorphism in the 3' untranslated region of the TNFR2 gene in Caucasoid SLE patients and geographically matched controls. No difference in the gene frequency of the two base-pair polymorphism in SLE patients compared to controls was found, nor was there any association with any particular clinical phenotype.
