This study aimed to explore the biomarkers of Alzheimer's disease (AD). The microarray data of GSE16759 were from the expression profile samples of 4 parietal lobe tissues from patients with AD and 4 ones from age-matched control participants. The differentially expressed micro RNAs (miRNAs) and genes (DEGs) underwent hierarchical clustering and function analysis followed by target genes prediction. Finally, DEGs were mapped to the target genes to construct miRNA-regulated networks. A total of 427 DEGs were obtained and clustered into 5 functions. After DEGs were mapped to the predicted target genes, 313 regulatory pairs were established. The target genes SEC22 vesicle trafficking protein homolog B (SEC22B) and SEC63 homolog (SEC63) regulated by miRNA-206, RAB10, member RAS oncogene family (RAB10) regulated by miRNA-655, and fms-related tyrosine kinase 1 (FLT1) regulated by miRNA-30e-3p and miRNA-369-3p were involved in the biological processes of protein transport and regulation of cell motion. The target genes SEC22B, RAB10, and FLT1 may be potential biomarkers of AD.
