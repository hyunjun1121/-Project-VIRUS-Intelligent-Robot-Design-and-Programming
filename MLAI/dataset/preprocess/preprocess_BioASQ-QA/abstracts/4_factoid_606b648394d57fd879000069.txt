The fungicide agents are a key component in the fruits and vegetables production. The Iprodione residues are one of the pesticide more frequently found in food products. The available data about the cytotoxicity of iprodione and its metabolites are scarce and do not allow characterization of its genotoxic potential and define the risk assessment.The human larynx epidermoid carcinoma cell line (HEp-2) has been shown to be sensitive to the toxic effects of xenobiotics of different origin and have been often used in citotoxicity and genotoxicity studies. The purpose of this paper is to evaluate the induction of genotoxicity and the role of oxidative stress in HEp-2cell line by exposure to the IP. The MTT test for viability resulted in CL<sub>50</sub> 85.86 (77.05-95.68) μg/mL of Iprodione. On the basis of this result, we proceeded to expose the cells to the sublethal concentrations (below the CL<sub>50</sub>) during 24 h to analyze the mitotic index and nuclear division index in order to determine the subcytotoxic concentrations of IP which the genotoxicity was evaluated. The subcytotoxic concentrations of 7, 17, and 25 μg/mL IP induced aneugenic effects as micronuclei centromere positive whereas 17 μg/mL was a threshold for centromere negative micronuclei induction in HEp-2 cells. The abnormal mitosis was induced for exposition of Hep-2 cells to the three concentrations. According to the result obtained, citotoxicity and genotoxicity oxidative stress studies were performed in 1.5, 7.0, and 25 μg/mL of IP. The results showed that the GSH intracellular content, the SOD activity and the levels of oxidative damage of the proteins were affected lead to redox imbalance. The decreased in the SOD activity and protein oxidation were in according to the result obtained to genotoxicity, suggesting that different biological targets could be affected.

Cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs) play a crucial role in cancer progression and even initiation. However, the origins of CAFs in various cancer types remain controversial, and one of the important hypothesized origins is through epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) from cancer cells. In this study, we investigated whether the HEp-2 laryngeal cancer cells are able to generate CAFs via EMT during tumor formation, which is now still unknown. The laryngeal xenografted tumor model was established by inoculating the HEp-2 laryngeal cancer cell line in nude mice. Primary cultured CAFs from the tumor nodules and matched normal fibroblasts (NFs) from the adjacent connective tissues were subcultured, purified, and verified by immunofluorescence. Migration, invasion, and proliferation potentials were compared between the CAFs and NFs. A co-culture of CAFs with HEp-2 cells and a co-injection of CAFs with HEp-2 cells in nude mice were performed to examine the cancer-promoting potential of CAFs to further verify their identity. Karyotypic analyses of the CAFs, NFs, and HEp-2 cells were conducted. A co-culture of NFs with HEp-2 cells was also performed to examine the expression of activated markers of CAFs. A pathological examination confirmed that the laryngeal xenografted tumor model was successfully established, containing abundant CAFs. Immunocytochemical staining verified the purities and identities of the CAFs and NFs. Although the CAFs manifested higher migration, invasion, proliferation, and cancer-promoting capacities compared with the NFs, an analysis of chromosomes revealed that both the CAFs and NFs showed typical normal mouse karyotypes. In addition, the NFs co-cultured with HEp-2 cells did not show induced expressions of activated markers of CAFs. Our findings reveal that the CAFs in the HEp-2 established laryngeal xenografted tumor are not of laryngeal cancer origin but of mouse origin, indicating that the HEp-2 laryngeal cancer cells cannot generate their own CAFs via EMT in this model.

Artepillin C is the main compound present in propolis from Baccharis dracunculifolia, whose antitumor activity has been the focus of many studies. Herein, we shall investigate the Artepillin C mechanisms of action against cells derived from the oropharyngeal carcinoma (HEp-2). Cytotoxicity tests revealed that the concentrations of Artepillin C required to reduce cell viability by 50% (CC<sub>50</sub>) are dependent on the incubation time, decreasing from 40.7 × 10<sup>-5</sup> mol/L to 15.7 × 10<sup>-5</sup> mol/L and 9.05 × 10<sup>-5</sup> mol/L considering 12, 24 and 48 h, respectively. Hydrophobic interactions on neutral species of Artepillin C induce aggregation over the HEp-2 plasma membrane, given the acid conditions of the cellular culture. Indeed, Langmuir monolayers mimicking cellular membranes of tumor cells revealed Artepillin C affinity to interact with 1,2-dipalmitoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine (DPPC) containing 20 mol% of 1,2-dipalmitoyl-sn-glychero-3-phosphoserine (DPPS), leading aggregation on giant unilamellar vesicles (GUVs) at pH 3.2. Moreover, leakage experiments on GUVs have shown that the presence of DPPS enhances the efflux of the fluorescent probe signaling the membrane permeabilization, which is the origin of the necrotic pathway triggered in HEp-2 cells, as observed by flow cytometry assays.

The photodynamic therapy (PDT) has been outstanding as a promising alternative for treating different carcinomas. However, the lack of detailed knowledge on the mechanisms of action prevents exploitation of the therapy full potential. Herein we shall evaluate not only the photodynamic efficiency but the mechanism of cell death triggered by the photoactivated erythrosine in oropharyngeal cancer cells (HEp-2). Cytotoxic assays were performed by MTT at distinct concentrations (10<sup>-3</sup> to 10<sup>-6</sup> mol/L) and incubation time (3, 24 and 48 h) of erythrosine in HEp-2 <i>in vitro</i> culture. In addition to the cytotoxic effect, the mechanisms of cell death were evaluated by flow cytometry following the annexin V/propidium iodide double staining protocol. Erythrosine was incorporated by HEp-2 cells in a dose- and time-dependent pathway. The incubation of erythrosine in dark has not shown any significant effect over the culture until 24 h and 1.25×10<sup>-6</sup> mol/L concentration, from which a small portion (<25% and statistically significant) of the cell population have undergone apoptosis. On the other hand, 50% of cell viability is reduced mainly by necrosis when 10, 3.75 and 1.9×10<sup>-6</sup> mol/L of erythrosine concentrations at 3, 24 and 48 h of incubation are photoactivated, respectively. Bioinspired models of tumor membrane based on Langmuir monolayers of 2-dioleoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine (DOPC) and 1,2-dioleoyl-sn-glycero-3-phospho-L-serine (DOPS) mixture reveled that electrostatic interactions with the lipid head groups are the main driving forces allowing the erythrosine adsorption. Furthermore, light-induced hydroperoxidation significantly increased the surface area of the monolayers, which might be the origin of the necrotic pathway triggered in HEp-2 cells.
