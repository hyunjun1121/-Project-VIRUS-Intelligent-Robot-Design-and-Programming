External-beam radiotherapy plays a critical role in the treatment of most pediatric solid tumors. Particularly in children, achieving an optimal therapeutic index to avoid damage to normal tissue is extremely important. Consequently, in metastatic disease, the utility of external-beam radiotherapy is limited. Molecular radiotherapy with tumor-targeted radionuclides may overcome some of these challenges, but to date there exists no single cancer-selective agent capable of treating various pediatric malignancies independently of their histopathologic origin. We tested the therapeutic potential of the clinical-grade alkyl-phospholipid ether analog CLR1404, 18-(<i>p</i>-iodophenyl)octadecyl phosphocholine, as a scaffold for tumor-targeted radiotherapy of pediatric malignancies. <b>Methods:</b> Uptake of CLR1404 by pediatric solid tumor cells was tested in vitro by flow cytometry and in vivo by PET/CT imaging and dosimetry. The therapeutic potential of <sup>131</sup>I-CLR1404 was evaluated in xenograft models. <b>Results:</b> In vitro, fluorescent CLR1404-BODIPY showed significant selective uptake in a variety of pediatric cancer lines compared with normal controls. In vivo tumor-targeted uptake in mouse xenograft models using <sup>124</sup>I-CLR1404 was confirmed by imaging. Single-dose intravenous injection of <sup>131</sup>I-CLR1404 significantly delayed tumor growth in all rodent pediatric xenograft models and extended animal survival while demonstrating a favorable side effect profile. <b>Conclusion:</b><sup>131</sup>I-CLR1404 has the potential to become a tumor-targeted radiotherapeutic drug with broad applicability in pediatric oncology. Because <sup>131</sup>I-CLR1404 has entered clinical trials in adults, our data warrant the development of pediatric clinical trials for this particularly vulnerable patient population.

Neuroblastoma may be treated with molecular radiotherapy, <sup>131</sup>I meta-Iodobenzylguanidine and <sup>177</sup>Lu Lutetium DOTATATE, directed at distinct molecular targets: Noradrenaline Transporter Molecule (NAT) and Somatostatin Receptor (SSTR2), respectively. This study used immunohistochemistry to evaluate target expression in archival neuroblastoma tissue, to determine whether it might facilitate clinical use of molecular radiotherapy. Tissue bank samples of formalin fixed paraffin embedded neuroblastoma tissue from patients for whom clinical outcome data were available were sectioned and stained with haematoxylin and eosin, and monoclonal antibodies directed against NAT and SSTR2. Sections were examined blinded to clinical information and scored for the percentage and intensity of tumour cells stained. These data were analysed in conjunction with clinical data. Tissue from 75 patients was examined. Target expression scores varied widely between patients: NAT median 45%, inter-quartile range 25% - 65%; and SSTR2 median 55%, interquartile range 30% - 80%; and in some cases heterogeneity of expression between different parts of a tumour was observed. A weak positive correlation was observed between the expression scores of the different targets: correlation coefficient = 0.23, p = 0.05. MYCN amplified tumours had lower SSTR2 scores: mean difference 23% confidence interval 8% - 39%, p < 0.01. Survival did not differ by scores. As expression of both targets is variable and heterogeneous, imaging assessment of both may yield more clinical information than either alone. The clinical value of immunohistochemical assessment of target expression requires prospective evaluation. Variable target expression within a patient may contribute to treatment failure.
