S100 proteins interact with the transactivation domain and the C-terminus of p53. Further, S100B has been shown to interact with MDM2, a central negative regulator of p53. Here, we show that S100B bound directly to the folded N-terminal domain of MDM2 (residues 2-125) by size exclusion chromatography and surface plasmon resonance experiments. This interaction with MDM2 (2-125) is a general feature of S100 proteins; S100A1, S100A2, S100A4 and S100A6 also interact with MDM2 (2-125). These interactions with S100 proteins do not result in a ternary complex with MDM2 (2-125) and p53. Instead, we observe the ability of a subset of S100 proteins to disrupt the extent of MDM2-mediated p53 ubiquitylation in vitro.

Our understanding of cancer has largely come from the analysis of aberrations within the tumor cell population. Yet it is increasingly clear that the tumor microenvironment can significantly influence tumorigenesis. For example, the mesenchyme can support the growth of tumorigenic epithelium. However, whether fibroblasts are subject to genetic/epigenetic changes as a result of selective pressures conferred by oncogenic stress in the epithelium has not been experimentally assessed. Recent analyses of some human carcinomas have shown tumor-suppressor gene mutations within the stroma, suggesting that the interplay among multiple cell types can select for aberrations nonautonomously during tumor progression. We demonstrate that this indeed occurs in a mouse model of prostate cancer where epithelial cell cycle disruption via cell-specific inhibition of pRb function induces a paracrine p53 response that suppresses fibroblast proliferation in associated stroma. This interaction imposes strong selective pressure yielding a highly proliferative mesenchyme that has undergone p53 loss.

S100A4 (also known as Mts1, metastasin, p9Ka, pEL98, CAPL, calvasculin, Fsp-1, placental calcium-binding protein) belongs to the family of EF-hand calcium-binding proteins, whose expression is elevated in a number of pathological conditions. Although it is well documented that S100A4 is expressed in cancer cells and contributes to tumor cell motility and metastatic progression, the exact underlying mechanisms remain elusive. An important characteristic feature of S100 proteins is their dual function, inside and outside the cell. In this review, we focus on the intracellular function of S100A4. The review contains structural analysis of S1004 in comparison with other members of S100 proteins. Possible modes of the interaction of S100 proteins with targets are described. Several examples of best-studied molecular interactions involving S100A4 with heavy chain of nonmuscle myosin IIA, LAR-interacting protein liprin beta1 and tumor suppressor protein p53 are provided. We suggest that the binding of S100A4 to these molecules is critical for the S100A4 function. Further studies of the implications of these interactions in different molecular pathways may shed additional light on the role of S100A4 protein in the control of tumor cell motility and migration. We discuss the approaches for down-regulation of S100A4 expression and their potential for application in the clinics.

S100A4 is a small calcium-binding protein that is commonly overexpressed in a range of different tumor types, and it is widely accepted that S100A4 has an important role in the process of cancer metastasis. In vitro binding assays has shown that S100A4 interacts with the tumor suppressor protein p53, indicating that S100A4 may have additional roles in tumor development. In the present study, we show that endogenous S100A4 and p53 interact in complex samples, and that the interaction increases after inhibition of MDM2-dependent p53 degradation using Nutlin-3A. Further, using proximity ligation assay, we show that the interaction takes place in the cell nucleus. S100A4 knockdown experiments in two p53 wild-type cell lines, A549 and HeLa, resulted in stabilization of p53 protein, indicating that S100A4 is promoting p53 degradation. Finally, we demonstrate that S100A4 knockdown leads to p53-dependent cell cycle arrest and increased cisplatin-induced apoptosis. Thus, our data add a new layer to the oncogenic properties of S100A4 through its inhibition of p53-dependent processes.

The effects of hyperthermia on the expression of p53, the apoptosis-associated genes Bax and Bcl-2, Notch and S100A4 have been studied in the HepG2 cell line and the HUT cell line derived from HepG2, adapted for growth in hyperthermic conditions. Hyperthermia inhibits cell proliferation and induces apoptosis. HepG2 and HUT cells differed in respect of anchorage to growth surface, degree of proliferation and apoptosis and expression of p53, Bax, Bcl-2, Notch, and S100A4 genes. The induction of apoptosis and the inhibition of cell proliferation occurred independently of p53, and independently also of involvement of the apoptosis family genes Bax and Bcl-2. We demonstrate novel and marked differences between transient heat shock and heat adaptation in respect of pathways of signaling and generation of phenotypic effects in vitro. Different signaling patterns have been identified here. Pathways of signaling by S100A4, by its interaction with and sequestration of p53, and by Notch also seem differentially operational in the induction of apoptosis, and both appear to be activated as alternative pathways in the context of hyperthermia signaling independently of p53.

A physical and functional interaction between the Ca(2+)-binding protein Mts1 (S100A4) and the tumor suppressor p53 protein is shown here for the first time. We demonstrate that Mts1 binds to the extreme end of the C-terminal regulatory domain of p53 by several in vitro and in vivo approaches: co-immunoprecipitation, affinity chromatography, and far Western blot analysis. The Mts1 protein in vitro inhibits phosphorylation of the full-length p53 and its C-terminal peptide by protein kinase C but not by casein kinase II. The Mts1 binding to p53 interferes with the DNA binding activity of p53 in vitro and reporter gene transactivation in vivo, and this has a regulatory function. A differential modulation of the p53 target gene (p21/WAF, bax, thrombospondin-1, and mdm-2) transcription was observed upon Mts1 induction in tet-inducible cell lines expressing wild type p53. Mts1 cooperates with wild type p53 in apoptosis induction. Our data imply that the ability of Mts1 to enhance p53-dependent apoptosis might accelerate the loss of wild type p53 function in tumors. In this way, Mts1 can contribute to the development of a more aggressive phenotype during tumor progression.

Nuclear localization of the metastasis-associated protein S100A4 has been shown to correlate with advanced disease stage in primary colorectal carcinomas (CRC), but nuclear function and its relevance for the metastatic capacity of tumor cells is still unclear. Among several nuclear interacting protein partners suggested for S100A4, the tumor suppressor protein p53 has attracted particular interest, and previous studies suggest direct and indirect modes of interaction between the two proteins. The present study was undertaken to assess coexpression and potential interaction in CRC. TP53 mutational status and S100A4 expression were investigated in a selected series of primary CRC specimens (n = 40) and cell lines (n = 17) using DNA sequencing, western blot, and double immunostaining. Additionally, S100A4 and p53 were experimentally up- and down-regulated in vitro to assess reciprocal effects. For the first time, S100A4 and p53 coexpression was demonstrated in individual CRC cells, with nuclear colocalization as a particularly interesting feature. In contrast to previous studies, no correlation was observed between TP53 mutational status and S100A4 expression, and no evidence was obtained to support reciprocal regulation between the two molecules in the HCT116 isogenic cell line model. In conclusion, S100A4 and p53 were shown to be colocalized in individual nuclei of CRC cells, and it might be speculated whether the proteins interact in this subcellular compartment.

Metastasis-associated protein S100A4 (Mts1) induces invasiveness of primary tumors and promotes metastasis. S100A4 belongs to the family of small calcium-binding S100 proteins that are involved in different cellular processes as transducers of calcium signal. S100A4 modulates properties of tumor cells via interaction with its intracellular targets, heavy chain of non-muscle myosin and p53. Here we report identification of a new molecular target of the S100A4 protein, liprin beta1. Liprin beta1 belongs to the family of leukocyte common antigen-related (LAR) transmembrane tyrosine phosphatase-interacting proteins that may regulate LAR protein properties via interaction with another member of the family, liprin alpha1. We showed by the immunoprecipitation analysis that S100A4 interacts specifically with liprin beta1 in vivo. Immunofluorescence staining demonstrated the co-localization of S100A4 and liprin beta1 in the cytoplasm and particularly at the protrusion sites of the plasma membrane. We mapped the S100A4 binding site at the C terminus of the liprin beta1 molecule between amino acid residues 938 and 1005. The S100A4-binding region contains two putative phosphorylation sites by protein kinase C and protein kinase CK2. S100A4-liprin beta1 interaction resulted in the inhibition of liprin beta1 phosphorylation by both kinases in vitro.

Metastasis-promoting Mts1(S100A4) protein belongs to the S100 family of Ca(2+)-binding proteins. A mouse strain with a germ-line inactivation of the S100A4 gene was generated. The mice were viable and did not display developmental abnormalities in the postnatal period. However, an abnormal sex ratio was observed in the litters with the S100A4-/- genotype, raising the possibility of a certain level of embryonic lethality in this strain. In all, 10% of 10-14-month-old S100A4-null animals developed tumors. This is a characteristic feature of mouse strains with inactivated tumor suppressor genes. Spontaneous tumors of S100A4-/- mice were p53 positive. Recently, we have shown that S100A4 interacts with p53 tumor suppressor protein and induces apoptosis. We proposed that impairment of this interaction could affect the apoptosis-promoting function of p53 that is involved in its tumor suppressor activity. The frequency of apoptosis in the spleen of S100A4-/- animals after whole-body gamma-irradiation was reduced compared to the wild-type animals. The same was true for the transcriptional activation of the p53 target genes - waf/p21/cip1 and bax. Taken together, these observations indicate that spontaneous tumors in S100A4-/- mice are a result of functional destabilization of p53 tumor suppressor gene.

Metastasis is a complex cascade of events involving a finely tuned interplay between malignant cells and multiple host factors. The transition from benign tumor growth to malignancy is manifested by the ability of tumor cells to traverse tissue barriers and invade surrounding tissues. Among a multitude of factors playing a role, the small calcium-binding protein S100A4 has been found to add to the invasive and metastatic capacity of cancer cells. However, the exact molecular function or mechanism by which S100A4 exerts its putative metastasis-promoting effects has not been fully elucidated, and the protein is most likely involved in several aspects of tumor progression. Several studies have recently described a direct interaction and/or reciprocal influence between S100A4 and the tumor suppressor protein p53. This corresponds to reports linking p53 to other S100-family members, especially S100B. The consequences are intriguing, connecting the metastasis-promoting protein S100A4 to the large set of important p53-mediated functions, with broad potential importance in cancer development and metastasis. In this review we emphasize the studies involving p53 and S100A4, elucidating and comparing reported results and conclusions.

Experimentally elevated levels of S100A4 induce a metastatic phenotype in benign mammary tumour cells in vivo. In humans, the presence of S100A4 in breast cancer cells correlates strongly with reduced patient survival. Potential interacting binding partners for S100A4 have now been examined using an optical biosensor. There was significant interaction of S100A4 with non-muscle myosin and p53, but not with actin, tropomyosin or tubulin. The results suggest that myosin and p53 are likely to be intracellular targets of S100A4. S100A4 had a greater affinity for wild-type or mutant arg-175-his p53 than for non-muscle myosin. The results suggest that S100A4 might induce metastasis by influencing the function of p53 as well as through its interaction with myosin and that any mechanism is independent of the mutational status of p53.

Proteins of the S100 family bind to the intrinsically disordered transactivation domain (TAD; residues 1-57) and C-terminus (residues 293-393) of the tumor suppressor p53. Both regions provide sites that are subject to posttranslational modifications, such as phosphorylation and acetylation, that can alter the affinity for interacting proteins such as p300 and MDM2. Here, we found that S100A1, S100A2, S100A4, S100A6, and S100B bound to two subdomains of the TAD (TAD1 and TAD2). Both subdomains were mandatory for high-affinity binding to S100 proteins. Phosphorylation of Ser and Thr residues increased the affinity for the p53 TAD. Conversely, acetylation and phosphorylation of the C-terminus of p53 decreased the affinity for S100A2 and S100B. In contrast, we found that nitrosylation of S100B caused a minor increase in binding to the p53 C-terminus, whereas binding to the TAD remained unaffected. As activation of p53 is usually accompanied by phosphorylation and acetylation at several sites, our results suggest that a shift in binding from the C-terminus in favor of the N-terminus occurs upon the modification of p53. We propose that binding to the p53 TAD might be involved in the stimulation of p53 activity by S100 proteins.

This study for the first time demonstrates a physical and functional interaction between the Ca(2+)-binding protein Mts1/S100A4 and tumor suppressor p53 protein. Using different in vitro and in vivo approaches, we have found that Mts1 can bind to the C-terminal regulatory domain of p53. The Mts1 binding to p53 promotes activation of the reporter gene transcription in vivo. A modulation of the p53 target gene (p21/WAF, bax, mdm-2, and thrombospondin-1) expression was observed upon Mts1 induction in the cells expressing the wild-type p53. These results suggest that the ability of Mts1 to enhance p53-dependent apoptosis of tumor cells leads to the decrease/disappearance of the tumor cells expressing the wild-type p53. Thus, Mts1 promotes selection of more aggressive, metastatic phenotype during tumor progression.

S100 proteins modulate p53 activity by interacting with its tetramerization (p53TET, residues 325-355) and transactivation (residues 1-57) domains. In this study, we characterized biophysically the binding of S100A1, S100A2, S100A4, S100A6 and S100B to homologous domains of p63 and p73 in vitro by fluorescence anisotropy, analytical ultracentrifugation and analytical gel filtration. We found that S100A1, S100A2, S100A4, S100A6 and S100B proteins bound different p63 and p73 tetramerization domain variants and naturally occurring isoforms with varying affinities in a calcium-dependent manner. Additional interactions were observed with peptides derived from the p63 and p73 N-terminal transactivation domains. Importantly, S100 proteins bound p63 and p73 with different affinities in their different oligomeric states, similarly to the differential modes of binding to p53. On the basis of our data, we hypothesize that S100 proteins regulate the oligomerization state of all three p53 family members and their isoforms, with a potential physiological relevance in developmental and disease-related processes. The regulation of the p53 family by S100 is complicated and depends on the target preference of each individual S100 protein, the concentration of the proteins and calcium, as well as the splicing variation of p63 or p73. Our results outlining the complexity of the interaction should be considered when studying the functional effects of S100 proteins in their biological context.
