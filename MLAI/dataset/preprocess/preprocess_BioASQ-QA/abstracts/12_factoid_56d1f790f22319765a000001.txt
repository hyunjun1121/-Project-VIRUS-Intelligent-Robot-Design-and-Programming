The aim of the present study was to investigate the prognostic impact of central nervous system metastases (CNS) after acquired resistance to epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR)-tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI) in EGFR-mutant non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). We defined CNS-collapse as death due to uncontrolled and progressive CNS metastases. Post-progression survival (PPS) after initial TKI failure and T790M status were retrospectively compared in 92 patients with or without CNS collapse. The median PPS in 32 patients with CNS-collapse (16.7 months) was significantly shorter than that of 60 without (26.8 months) (p=0.0002). T790M was detected in four (12%) out of the 32 CNS-collapse patients and in 26 (43%) out of 60 without (p=0.0026). Median PPS in 39 patients with leptomeningeal metastases (LM) (11.4 months) was significantly shorter versus 53 without (26.8 months) (p=0.0006). The median PPS was 25.1 months in 40 patients with brain metastases and 11.2 months in 52 without (p=0.0387). T790M was detected in 4/5 resected brain tumors (80%) and in 1/26 cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) samples (4%) (p=0.0008). CNS-collapse represented poorer prognosis, which was associated with T790M-negative status and LM. Controlling CNS metastases, especially LM, is important to achieve longer survival.

Patients with non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) with somatic activating mutations of the epidermal growth factor receptor gene (EGFR mutations) generally respond to EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitors (EGFR-TKIs). β-Catenin is a key component of the Wnt/β-Catenin signal and is an important oncogene that is involved in the pathogenesis and progression of malignant tumors, especially cancer stem cells. We found that EGFR-mutated NSCLC cell lines exhibited a high expression level of β-Catenin, compared with cell lines with the wild-type EGFR gene, and XAV939 (a β-Catenin inhibitor) enhanced the sensitivities to EGFR-TKI in EGFR-mutated NSCLC cell lines. In EGFR-mutated NSCLC cell lines with the acquired resistance threonine-to-methionine mutation in codon 790 (T790M) mutation, XAV939 enhanced the sensitivity of the cells to an irreversible EGFR-TKI but not a reversible EGFR-TKI. The combination of XAV939 and EGFR-TKIs strongly inhibited the β-Catenin signal and strongly decreased the phosphorylation of EGFR, compared with the use of EGFR-TKIs alone, suggesting an interaction between EGFR and the β-Catenin signal. The stem cell-like properties of the EGFR-mutated cell line carrying the T790M mutation were inhibited by XAV939 and BIBW2992 (an irreversible EGFR-TKI). Furthermore, the stem cell-like properties were strongly inhibited by a combination of both the agents. A xenograft study demonstrated that β-Catenin knockdown enhanced the antitumor effect of BIBW2992 in the EGFR-mutated NSCLC cell line carrying the T790M mutation. Our findings indicate that β-Catenin might be a novel therapeutic target in EGFR-mutated NSCLC carrying the T790M mutation.

Tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) targeting the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) have shown effectiveness for advanced non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) with activating mutations in the EGFR gene. However, resistance to the EGFR TKIs develops mostly secondary to T790M mutation in exon 20. The use of afatinib associated with cetuximab represents a new possibility of therapy following progression on gefitinib or erlotinib. We present two patients who acquired resistance to first-generation TKI and who underwent combination treatment with afatinib plus cetuximab as third-line therapy. Both patients presented partial response, and the time duration of disease control was 8 months and 10 months. The combined use of afatinib plus cetuximab emerges as a new possibility for the treatment of patients with advanced NSCLC harboring mutated EGFR after progression on first-generation EGFR TKIs with consequently acquired resistance to TKIs. Further studies are necessary to consolidate the data.

Nearly one half of all cases of acquired resistance to epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) for non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) are due to the T790M mutation in EGFR exon 20. The T790M mutation is a C→T transition mutation at a CpG dinucleotide. DNA methylation of cytosine (5-methylcytosine (5-mC)) in CpG dinucleotides is a common DNA modification; CpG dinucleotides are considered to be mutational hotspots that cause genetic diseases and cancers through spontaneous deamination of 5-mC, resulting in C→T transition mutations. This study aimed to examine the methylation level of cytosine of EGFR codon 790 and investigate whether DNA methylation was involved in acquiring the T790M mutation. We examined 18 NSCLC tumor tissues, 7 normal lymph node tissues, and 4 NSCLC cell lines (PC9, HCC827, 11-18, and A549). 5-mC was checked by bisulfite sequencing and quantified by pyrosequencing. We found that all tissue samples and cell lines had 5-mC in EGFR codon 790. The 5-mC range was 58.4-90.8%. Our results imply that hypermethylation of the CpG dinucleotide in EGFR codon 790 leads to the C→T transition mutation, causing resistance to EGFR-TKI treatment.

Lung cancer is the leading cause of cancer related deaths in Canada with non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) being the predominant form of the disease. Tumor characterization can identify cancer-driving mutations as treatment targets. One of the most successful examples of cancer targeted therapy is inhibition of mutated epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR), which occurs in ~10-30% of NSCLC patients. While this treatment has benefited many patients with activating EGFR mutations, almost all who initially benefited will eventually acquire resistance. Approximately 50% of cases of acquired resistance (AR) are due to a secondary T790M mutation in exon 20 of the EGFR gene; however, many of the remaining mechanisms of resistance are still unknown. Much work has been done to elucidate the remaining mechanisms of resistance. This review aims to highlight both the mechanisms of resistance that have already been identified in patients and potential novel mechanisms identified in preclinical models which have yet to be validated in the patient settings.

Non‑small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) cells harboring mutations in the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) gene initially respond well to EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKI), including gefitinib. However the tumor cells will invariably develop acquired resistance to the drug. The EGFR T790M mutation is generally considered to be the molecular genetic basis of acquired TKI resistance. The present study aimed to explore how the T790M mutation induces tumor cells to escape inhibition by TKI treatment. An acquired gefitinib‑resistant cell line (NCI‑H1975/GR) was generated from the NCI‑H1975 human NSCLC cell line, which harbors the sensitive L858R and resistant T790M mutations of EGFR. The resistant cell line was established by exposing the cells intermittently to increasing concentrations of gefitinib. The mechanisms by which NSCLC acquires resistance to TKIs based on the T790M mutation, were investigated by detecting the protein expression levels of the EGFR/Kirsten rat sarcoma viral oncogene homolog (KRAS)/v‑Raf murine sarcoma viral oncogene homolog B (BRAF) transduction pathway, and epithelial‑mesenchymal transition (EMT) with immunocytochemistry. The resistance of the NCI‑H1975/GR cells to gefitinib was 2.009‑fold, as compared with the parent cells; however, the protein expression levels of EGFR, KRAS and BRAF were lower in the resistant cells. Some mesenchymal morphology was observed in the NCI‑H1975/GR cells, alongside a decreasing E‑cadherin expression and increasing vimentin expression. These results suggest that the reactivation of the EGFR/KRAS/BRAF transduction pathway was not detected in the NCI‑H1975/GR cells. EMT may have an important role in the development of acquired resistance to EGFR‑TKIs in NSCLC cells with sensitivity and resistance mutations.

Acquired resistance to erlotinib in patients with EGFR-mutant non-small cell lung cancer can result from aberrant activation of alternative receptor tyrosine kinases, such as the HGF-driven c-MET receptor. We sought to determine whether inhibition of AKT signaling could augment erlotinib activity and abrogate HGF-mediated resistance. The effects of MK-2206, a selective AKT inhibitor, were evaluated in combination with erlotinib on a large panel of 13 lung cancer cell lines containing different EGFR or KRAS abnormalities. The activity of the combination was assessed using proliferation assays, flow cytometry and immunoblotting. The MEK inhibitor PD0325901 was used to determine the role of the MAP kinase pathway in erlotinib resistance. The combination of MK-2206 and erlotinib resulted in synergistic growth inhibition independent of EGFR mutation status. In cell lines where HGF blocked the anti-proliferative and cytotoxic effects of erlotinib, MK-2206 could restore cell cycle arrest, but MEK inhibition was required for erlotinib-dependent apoptosis. Both AKT and MEK inhibition contributed to cell death independent of erlotinib in the T790M-containing H1975 and the EGFR-WT cell lines tested. These findings illustrate the potential advantages and challenges of combined signal transduction inhibition as a generalized strategy to circumvent acquired erlotinib resistance.

Here we studied cell-free plasma DNA (cfDNA) collected from subjects with advanced lung cancer whose tumors had developed resistance to the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI) AZD9291. We first performed next-generation sequencing of cfDNA from seven subjects and detected an acquired EGFR C797S mutation in one; expression of this mutant EGFR construct in a cell line rendered it resistant to AZD9291. We then performed droplet digital PCR on serial cfDNA specimens collected from 15 AZD9291-treated subjects. All were positive for the T790M mutation before treatment, but upon developing AZD9291 resistance three molecular subtypes emerged: six cases acquired the C797S mutation, five cases maintained the T790M mutation but did not acquire the C797S mutation and four cases lost the T790M mutation despite the presence of the underlying EGFR activating mutation. Our findings provide insight into the diversity of mechanisms through which tumors acquire resistance to AZD9291 and highlight the need for therapies that are able to overcome resistance mediated by the EGFR C797S mutation.

Two types of epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) mutations in exon 19 and exon 21 (ex19del and L858R) are prevalent in lung cancer patients and sensitive to targeted EGFR inhibition. A resistance mutation in exon 20 (T790M) has been found to accompany drug treatment when patients relapse. These three mutations are valuable companion diagnostic biomarkers for guiding personalized treatment. Quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR)-based methods have been widely used in the clinic by physicians to guide treatment decisions. The aim of this study was to evaluate the technical and clinical sensitivity and specificity of the droplet digital polymerase chain reaction (ddPCR) method in detecting the three EGFR mutations in patients with lung cancer. Genomic DNA from H1975 and PC-9 cells, as well as 92 normal human blood specimens, was used to determine the technical sensitivity and specificity of the ddPCR assays. Genomic DNA of formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded specimens from 78 Chinese patients with lung adenocarcinoma were assayed using both qPCR and ddPCR. The three ddPCR assays had a limit of detection of 0.02% and a wide dynamic range from 1 to 20,000 copies measurement. The L858R and ex19del assays had a 0% background level in the technical and clinical settings. The T790M assay appeared to have a 0.03% technical background. The ddPCR assays were robust for correct determination of EGFR mutation status in patients, and the dynamic range appeared to be better than qPCR methods. The ddPCR assay for T790M could detect patient samples that the qPCR method failed to detect. About 49% of this patient cohort had EGFR mutations (L858R, 15.4%; ex19del, 29.5%; T790M, 6.4%). Two patients with the ex19del mutation also had a naïve T790M mutation. These data suggest that the ddPCR method could be useful in the personalized treatment of patients with lung cancer.

The T790M mutation in EGFR accounts for approximately half of all lung cancer cases with acquired resistance to the current clinical EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitors. In tyrosine kinase inhibitor-resistant lung tumors, rociletinib and AZD9291 are highly active when T790M is present and modestly active when T790M is absent.

In nonsmall cell lung cancer (NSCLC), the threonine(790)-methionine(790) (T790M) point mutation of EGFR kinase is one of the leading causes of acquired resistance to the first generation tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs), such as gefitinib and erlotinib. Herein, we describe the optimization of a series of 7-oxopyrido[2,3-d]pyrimidinyl-derived irreversible inhibitors of EGFR kinase. This led to the discovery of compound 24 which potently inhibits gefitinib-resistant EGFR(L858R,T790M) with 100-fold selectivity over wild-type EGFR. Compound 24 displays strong antiproliferative activity against the H1975 nonsmall cell lung cancer cell line, the first line mutant HCC827 cell line, and promising antitumor activity in an EGFR(L858R,T790M) driven H1975 xenograft model sparing the side effects associated with the inhibition of wild-type EGFR.

To overcome T790M-mediated acquired resistance of lung cancer cells to epidermal growth factor receptor tyrosine kinase inhibitors (EGFR TKIs), second generation TKIs such as BIBW2992 (afatinib) and third generation TKIs including WZ4002 have been developed. However, clinical data on their efficacy in treating T790M mutant tumors are lacking. Histone deacetylase (HDAC) inhibitors have been reported to arrest cell growth and to lead to differentiation and apoptosis of various cancer cells, both in vitro and in vivo. In the present study, we assessed whether the combination of suberoylanilide hydroxamic acid (SAHA, vorinostat), a potent HDAC inhibitor, and BIBW2992 or WZ4002 could overcome EGFR TKI resistance associated with T790M mutation in lung cancer cells. While treatment with BIBW2992 or WZ4002 alone slightly reduced the viability of PC-9G and H1975 cells, which possess T790M mutation, combining them with SAHA resulted in significantly decreased cell viability through the activation of the apoptotic pathway. This combination also enhanced autophagy occurrence and inhibition of autophagy significantly reduced the apoptosis induced by the combination treatment, showing that autophagy is required for the enhanced apoptosis. Caspase-independent autophagic cell death was also induced by the combination treatment with SAHA and either BIBW2992 or WZ4002. Finally, the combined treatment with SAHA and either BIBW2992 or WZ4002 showed an enhanced anti-tumor effect on xenografts of H1975 cells in vivo. In conclusion, the combination of new generation EGFR TKIs and SAHA may be a new strategy to overcome the acquired resistance to EGFR TKIs in T790M mutant lung cancer.
