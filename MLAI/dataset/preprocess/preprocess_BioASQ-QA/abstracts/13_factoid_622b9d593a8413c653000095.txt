Cathepsin B (CB) is involved in degradation of extracellular matrix proteins during tumor progression in human solid organ tumors (such as colorectal, bladder, and breast cancers), including human prostate cancer. Its activities are regulated by endogenous inhibitors (such as stefins or cystatins). Increased expression of cathepsin B message, protein, and membrane association have been linked to malignancy, but there are very few studies of their mRNA expression in prostate cancer using in situ hybridization techniques. Our objective was to determine the relationship of CB and stefin A (cystatin A) mRNA localization to the Gleason grading system for histologic scores in the hope of distinguishing aggressive and less aggressive variants of prostate cancer. We used a 25-base biotinylated oligonucleotide CB cDNA antisense probe to localize CB message and a 27-base biotinylated oligonucleotide stefin A cDNA antisense probe to localize stefin A message. Prostate samples from 41 prostatectomy patients were collected along with their pre-surgery serum PSA levels and clinical stage of the disease. Sections prepared from frozen prostate tissue samples were hybridized with the CB and stefin A and control pBR 322 probes using techniques reported by Sinha et al. [1] and their distribution quantitated by an image analysis system. Prostate sections treated with RNAse before hybridization or incubated with the pBR 322 control probe showed little or no reaction products, confirming that localization of CB and stefin A probes was specific. In prostate cancer, the reaction products were found in neoplastic and invasive cells and occasionally in stromal cells. The ratios of CB to stefin A were similar in normal prostate and benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) whereas they varied consistently within and between Gleason histologic scores for prostate cancer. These variations showed three localization patterns; namely, prostate cancers with higher levels of CB than stefin A, lower levels of CB than stefin A, and similar levels of CB and stefin A. All three patterns and ratios for CB and stefin A were found in prostate samples (22/41) represented by the Gleason histologic score 6 tumors. In these tumors, serum PSA levels ranged from 1 to 78 ng/ml and prostate cancers showed B, C, and D clinical stages. There was no correlation of CB/stefin A ratio and serum PSA values or clinical stage in a limited number of prostate cancer cases. Our data showed that there were prostate cancer cases within Gleason histologic scores which expressed high, similar, and low levels of CB when compared to stefin A. We postulate that prostate cancer cases showing higher levels of CB compared to stefin A probably represent an aggressive variant of this cancer within any one Gleason histologic score. If this is the case, aggressive variants of prostate cancer would occur within Gleason scores 3 to 10 even though higher scores are usually considered more aggressive forms of prostate cancers. Since our study is based upon a very limited number of frozen prostate samples, we emphasize that a larger series of archival prostate cancer samples along with their survival data should be analyzed to establish any relationship of CB/stefin A ratio and aggressive variants of this cancer. Therefore, our conclusion is tentative. Our study provides a partial explanation for differences in the clinical course of prostate cancer in patients. This is the first study to show that determination of CB and stefin A mRNA ratios may lead to identification of aggressive and less aggressive variants of prostate cancer within a Gleason histologic score.

Most adenocarcinomas of the prostate with a Gleason score greater than 8 at radical prostatectomy have extraprostatic extension and a high risk of progression. With prostate-specific antigen screening, we have seen some cases of earlier detected, organ-confined, high-grade adenocarcinoma. Few data are available as to the likelihood of cure in these cases. We reviewed 27 cases of pathologically organ-confined adenocarcinoma with a prostatectomy Gleason score of 8 to 10. To exclude cases with a significant proportion of Gleason pattern 3, we excluded cases of Gleason score 3+5=8 and Gleason score 5+3=8. All cases of Gleason score 8 at radical prostatectomy were Gleason score 4+4. The prognostic value of the clinical parameters (clinical stage, serum prostate-specific antigen level, age) and pathologic factors (biopsy Gleason score, radical prostatectomy Gleason score, prostatectomy tumor volume) were tested to predict postoperative progression. The mean age at diagnosis was 59.7 years (range 46 to 69) with preoperative serum prostate-specific antigen levels ranging from 1.4 to 28 ng/mL (mean 7.8). All tumors were classified as pathologic Stage T2N0Mx. Fifteen patients (55.6%) had a Gleason score of 8, 11 patients (40.7%) had a Gleason score of 9, and 1 had a Gleason score of 10 (3.7%). Tumor volumes ranged from 0.02 to 1.44 cm(3) (mean 0.56). Follow-up information was available for all men. The mean follow-up for those without progression was 30.6 months (range 7 to 73) and for those with progression was 23.6 months (range 9 to 44). The 33-month actuarial risk of progression was 32%, with 10 men developing progression during the study. None of the preoperative or postoperative variables predicted progression. Even when high-grade tumor is organ confined, it is associated with a relatively unfavorable short-term outcome that is not predictable on the basis of either preoperative clinicopathologic data or postoperative pathologic information obtained from the radical prostatectomy specimen.

Patients with Gleason score 7 prostate cancer on radical prostatectomy demonstrate a wide range in clinical outcome. Gleason grade 4 prostate cancer encompasses a heterogeneous group of tumor growth patterns including fused, ill-defined, cribriform, and glomeruloid glandular structures. Our objective was to determine the prognostic value of different Gleason grade 4 growth patterns. We performed a nested case-control study among 535 patients with Gleason score 7 prostate cancer at radical prostatectomy, treated between March 1985 and July 2013 at a university hospital in the Netherlands. We analyzed 52 cases (with metastasis, disease-specific mortality or both) and 109 controls, matched for age, PSA level, and pT stage. Presence of the following Gleason grade 4 patterns was recorded: fused, ill-defined, cribriform, and glomeruloid. Intraductal carcinoma of the prostate and tertiary Gleason grade 5 were additionally assessed. Outcomes were metastasis-free survival and disease-specific survival. We used Cox proportional hazards regression to determine the predictive value of Gleason grade 4 patterns for survival time. The overall prevalence of Gleason grade 4 patterns was as follows: fused 75% (n=121), ill-defined 64% (n=102), cribriform 48% (n=83), and glomeruloid 25% (n=40). Cribriform pattern was the only pattern with an unequal distribution between cases and controls. Forty-two out of 52 cases (81%) had cribriform growth pattern versus 41/109 controls (38%). In multivariate analysis, presence of cribriform growth was an adverse independent predictor for distant metastasis-free survival (HR 8.0, 95% CI 3.0-21; P<0.001) and disease-specific survival (HR 5.4, 95% CI 2.0-15, P=0.001). In conclusion, cribriform growth in Gleason grade 4 is a strong prognostic marker for distant metastasis and disease-specific death in patients with Gleason score 7 prostate cancer at radical prostatectomy.

Men with Gleason score 9-10 prostate cancer have worse outcomes compared to those with Gleason 8 disease. Upfront treatments remain controversial for these patients. Using the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) database, we evaluated the impact of initial treatment with external beam radiation therapy (EBRT), external beam radiation therapy with brachytherapy (EBRT + BT), or surgery on prostate cancer-specific mortality (PCSM) and overall mortality (OM) in Gleason 9-10 disease. The SEER database was queried for men diagnosed with biopsy Gleason 9-10 prostate cancer from 2005 to 2014. Gathered data included demographic, pathologic, therapy received, and survival outcomes. Kaplan-Meier survival curves and crude and multivariate analyses were generated for initial therapy with EBRT, EBRT + BT, or surgery. A total of 7877 men were included, 4465 (56.7%) who underwent upfront treatment with EBRT alone, 623 (7.9%) with EBRT + BT, and 2789 (35.4%) with surgery. The 7 year PCSM rates were 29.2, 15.0, and 14.6% for EBRT, EBRT + BT, and surgery respectively (p < 0.001). The 7 year OM rates were 43.8, 27.2, and 20.0% for EBRT, EBRT + BT, and surgery, respectively (p < 0.001).When controlling for age, year of diagnosis, Gleason score, clinical T stage, and PSA level on multivariate analysis, EBRT had greater PCSM and OM than surgery (HR 0.41, 95% CI 0.28-0.61, p < 0.001 and HR 0.44, 95% CI 0.34-0.57, p < 0.001 respectively), but the mortality differences was not statistically significant between EBRT and EBRT + BT. Among men with localized Gleason 9-10 disease, surgery was associated with statistically significant improved survival outcomes compared to EBRT alone.

High Gleason score 8 to 10 adenocarcinoma is the most aggressive and potentially lethal form of prostate cancer. The 2005 International Society of Urological Pathology (ISUP)-modified Gleason grading scheme defines several gland arrangements of high Gleason grade patterns 4 and 5. The aim of this investigation was to quantitate the frequency of the ISUP-defined high Gleason grade patterns in needle biopsy tissue, to determine the common admixtures and to characterize patterns not presented in the 2005 ISUP report. For patients who underwent radical prostatectomy, we analyzed for association of specific high-grade patterns in needle biopsy with extraprostatic extension in radical prostatectomy tissues. A total of 268 prostate needle biopsy cases with Gleason score of 8 to 10 were examined. A mean of 3.6 patterns (range, 1 to 8) were identified per case and only 12% of cases had a pure single pattern. Ill-defined glands with poorly formed lumina (at 57%) and fused microacinar glands (at 53%) comprised the predominant and most frequently admixed patterns. Single cells and single signet ring cells were present in 53% and 31% of cases, respectively. Additional patterns in order of frequency included cords (35%), cribriform glands (25%), sheets of cells (19%), chains (4%), glomeruloid (3%), comedonecrosis (2%), and hypernephromatoid (1 case=0.3%). Gleason score 8 to 10 carcinomas are typically extensive in needle core tissue, with a mean of 4.4 positive cores (range, 1 to 15 cores) per case. Only 14 cases (5%) had high-grade minimal carcinoma measuring <1 mm in needle core tissue. Gleason grade patterns not described in the 2005 ISUP report include single file growth, solid cylinders, and nested patterns. The single file pattern was present in 40% of cases, and the small solid nested pattern was detected in 24% of cases. One case displayed solid cylinders. Only the single file pattern was associated with extraprostatic extension at radical prostatectomy (P=0.005). These results show that the 2005 ISUP-defined patterns of high Gleason score 8 to 10 prostatic adenocarcinoma can be stratified on the basis of frequency of occurrence in needle biopsy tissue. Three patterns not defined in the 2005 ISUP scheme have been characterized, including single file, nested, and solid cylinder arrangements. As aggressive and potentially lethal prostate cancer is most often of Gleason score 8 to 10, it is important for diagnostic recognition purposes to be aware of the frequency of various patterns encountered in high Gleason score 8 to 10 adenocarcinomas, the types of pattern admixtures, and the histomorphologic presentation of unusual patterns. We propose that Gleason grade assignments should incorporate single file, solid nested, and solid cylinder arrangements as high-grade pattern 5 because of the absence of glandular luminal space formation.

Accurate recognition of Gleason pattern 5 (GP5) prostate adenocarcinoma (PCa) on core biopsy (NBX) is critical because it is associated with disease progression and the worst clinical outcome. We evaluated 1557 consecutive and prospectively collected NBXs to determine the frequency of diagnosis, morphologic subpatterns, and their relation to the amount and pattern distribution of GP5 PCa based on the 2005 modified Gleason grading system. Tertiary GP5 was upgraded to a secondary pattern to derive the final Gleason score. GP5 accounted for 6% of all NBXs and 14% of PCa cases. GP5 PCas were associated with high-risk preoperative clinical and biopsy characteristics, regardless of the amount of GP5. Most patients (85%) with % GP5 greater than 5% of PCa had the final Gleason score of 9 to 10, compared with % GP5 of 5% or less of PCa (P < .0001). The morphologic subpatterns of GP5 PCas were as follows: infiltrating cords (96%), single cells (76%), solid sheets (29%), and comedocarcinoma (2%). Infiltrating cords and single-cell patterns frequently coexisted (76%). The GP5 was distributed in a tertiary (66%), followed by secondary (32%) and primary (2%) components of PCa. Infiltrating cords and single cells were the 2 most frequently encountered patterns, specifically when GP5 involved 5% or less of PCa and represented secondary or tertiary component of PCa. GP5 PCa is a relatively frequent presentation in the contemporary NBX practice. Because of its important prognostic and therapeutic implications, pathologists must be aware of its varied morphologic presentations and to the fact that most cases with GP5 represent a tertiary component of PCa.

The Gleason score is an important parameter for clinical outcome in prostate cancer patients. Gleason score 8 is a heterogeneous disease including Gleason score 3 + 5, 4 + 4, and 5 + 3 tumors, and encompasses a broad range of tumor growth patterns. Our objective was to characterize individual growth patterns and identify prognostic parameters in Gleason score 8 prostate cancer patients. We reviewed 1064 radical prostatectomy specimens, recorded individual Gleason 4 and 5 growth patterns as well as presence of intraductal carcinoma, and evaluated biochemical recurrence- and metastasis-free survival. Gleason score 8 disease was identified in 140 (13%) patients, of whom 76 (54%) had Gleason score 3 + 5, 46 (33%) 4 + 4, and 18 (13%) 5 + 3 disease. Invasive cribriform and/or intraductal carcinoma (n = 87, 62%) was observed more frequently in Gleason score 4 + 4 (93%) than 3 + 5 (47%; P < 0.001) and 5 + 3 (44%; P < 0.001) patients. Gleason pattern 5 was present in 110 (79%) men: as single cells and/or cords in 99 (90%) and solid fields in 32 (29%) cases. Solid field pattern 5 coexisted with cribriform architecture (23/32, 72%) more frequently than nonsolid pattern 5 cases (36/78, 46%, P = 0.02). In multivariable analysis including age, prostate-specific antigen, pT-stage, surgical margin status, and lymph node metastases, presence of cribriform architecture was an independent parameter for biochemical recurrence-free (hazard ratio (HR) 2.0, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.0-3.7; P = 0.04) and metastasis-free (HR 3.5, 95% CI 1.0-12.3; P = 0.05) survival. In conclusion, invasive cribriform and/or intraductal carcinoma occurs more frequently in Gleason score 4 + 4 prostate cancer patients than in Gleason score 3 + 5 and 5 + 3, and is an independent parameter for biochemical recurrence and metastasis. Therefore, cribriform architecture has added value in risk stratification of Gleason score 8 prostate cancer patients.

The Gleason score of prostate adenocarcinomas is an important preoperative predictor of cancer behavior, and is used to help guide treatment. In the setting of more than two positive biopsy sites, pathologists usually grade the tumor at each site separately, and the Gleason score may differ from each positive site. This study seeks to determine if the highest Gleason score in all biopsy sites, or the Gleason score in the site with the highest tumor volume on the needle biopsy is the best predictor of final Gleason score in the radical prostatectomy specimens. Various preoperative biopsy findings were analyzed. All 151 patients had at least two positive biopsy sites and underwent radical prostatectomy. Primary and secondary Gleason pattern grades were assigned for each positive biopsy site. The tumor volume in the needle biopsy site was defined by the percentage of areas of biopsy cores involved by cancer. The radical prostatectomy specimens were completely embedded and processed in the whole-mount method. The Gleason score from both the biopsy site with the highest Gleason score and the biopsy site with the highest tumor volume on the needle biopsy correlated equally well with final Gleason score at radical prostatectomy (Spearman correlation coefficient =0.54 for both, P<0.001). The Gleason score from both the biopsy site with the highest Gleason score and the biopsy site with the highest tumor volume on the needle biopsy also correlated with primary Gleason pattern grade at radical prostatectomy (Spearman correlation coefficient =0.53 for both, P<0.001). Secondary Gleason pattern grade from the biopsy site with the highest tumor volume on the needle biopsy correlated with secondary Gleason pattern grade at radical prostatectomy slightly better than those from the biopsy site with the highest Gleason score (Spearman correlation coefficient, 0.32 vs 0.24; both P<0.001). Our data indicate that the highest Gleason score from all sites and the Gleason score from the site with the highest tumor volume on the needle biopsy are equally and significantly predictive of final Gleason score on radical prostatectomy. Both methods of prediction are significantly predictive of primary and secondary Gleason pattern grade on radical prostatectomy. We recommend that the highest Gleason score from all positive biopsy sites should be used when assigning an initial score using needle biopsies.

If multiple biopsy cores contain prostate cancer with differing Gleason scores, should an overall Gleason score be assigned, or should each core be graded separately? We obtained data on 127 men with prostate cancer on needle biopsy who underwent subsequent radical prostatectomy at our institution. We compared the Gleason scores found on needle biopsy with the grade and stage (organ-confined, extra-prostatic extension, positive seminal vesicles or lymph nodes) at radical prostatectomy. On biopsy, 40 men had a pure Gleason score of 4 + 3 = 7, 25 men had a Gleason score of 4 + 3 = 7 with a Gleason score of 3 + 3 = 6 on a separate core of the biopsy specimen, 27 men had a pure Gleason score of 4 + 4 = 8, and 35 men had a Gleason score of 4 + 4 = 8 with separate cores containing Gleason pattern grade 3. A Gleason score of 4 + 4 = 8 with pattern grade 3 in other cores had a more advanced stage than a pure Gleason score of 4 + 3 = 7 (P = 0.008). There was no clear pattern analyzing pathological stage of men with a pure Gleason score of 4 + 3 = 7 in comparison with those with Gleason scores of 4 + 3 = 7 and 3 + 3 = 6 in other cores. The group with a Gleason score of 4 + 4 = 8 and Gleason pattern grade 3 on other cores had a higher overall grade on radical prostatectomy than the group with a pure Gleason score of 4 + 3 = 7 (P = 0.001). If one had assigned an overall Gleason score, then a biopsy with Gleason score 4 + 4 = 8 on 1 or more cores and some pattern grade 3 in other cores, would be designated as a Gleason score of 4 + 3 = 7. Based on our findings, patients with a Gleason score of 4 + 4 = 8 on one or more cores with pattern grade 3 in other cores should be given a final Gleason score of 4 + 4 = 8 instead of 4 + 3 = 7, because these patients are more likely to have higher stage and grade on radical prostatectomy, comparable to a pure Gleason score of 4 + 4 = 8. Each core should be assigned a separate Gleason score, especially in cases with high Gleason score cancer on at least 1 core.

There have been only a few contradictory publications assessing whether Gleason score 4 + 3 = 7 has a worse prognosis than 3 + 4 = 7 on biopsy material in predicting pathological stage and biochemical recurrence. Older studies predated the use of the modified Gleason grading system established in 2005. We retrospectively studied 1,791 cases of Gleason score 7 on prostatic biopsy to determine whether the breakdown of Gleason score 7 into 3 + 4 vs 4 + 3 has prognostic significance in the modern era. There was no difference in patient age, preoperative serum prostate specific antigen, maximum tumor percent per core or the number of positive cores between Gleason score 3 + 4 = 7 and Gleason score 4 + 3 = 7. Gleason score 4 + 3 = 7 showed an overall correlation with pathological stage (organ confined, focal extraprostatic extension, nonfocal extraprostatic extension, seminal vesicle invasion/lymph node metastases, p = 0.005). On multivariate analysis Gleason score 4 + 3 = 7 (p = 0.03), number of positive cores (p = 0.002), maximum percent of cancer per core (p = 0.006) and preoperative serum prostate specific antigen (p = 0.03) all correlated with pathological stage. Gleason score 4 + 3 = 7 on biopsy was also associated with an increased risk of biochemical progression after radical prostatectomy (p = 0.0001). On multivariate analysis Gleason score 4 + 3 = 7 (p = 0.001), maximum percent of cancer per core (p <0.0001) and preoperative serum prostate specific antigen (p <0.0001) but not number of positive cores correlated with the risk of biochemical progression after radical prostatectomy. Our study further demonstrates that Gleason score 7 should not be considered a homogenous group for the purposes of disease management and prognosis.

The Gleason score remains the most reliable prognosticator in men with prostate cancer. One of the recent important modifications in the Gleason grading system recommended from the International Society of Urological Pathology consensus conference is recording the percentage of Gleason pattern 4 in the pathology reports of prostate needle biopsy and radical prostatectomy cases with Gleason score 7 prostatic adenocarcinoma. Limited data have indeed suggested that the percent Gleason pattern 4 contributes to stratifying the prognosis of patients who undergo radical prostatectomy. An additional obvious benefit of reporting percent pattern 4 includes providing critical information for treatment decisions. This review summarizes and discusses available studies assessing the utility of the percentage of Gleason pattern 4 in the management of prostate cancer patients.

Reelin is a glycoprotein that plays a critical role in the regulation of neuronal migration during brain development and, since reelin has a role in the control of cell migration, it might represents an important factor in cancer pathology. In this study, 66 surgical specimens of prostate cancer were analyzed for reelin expression by immunohistochemical method. The reelin expression was correlated with Gleason score and individual Gleason patterns. Reelin expression was found in 39% prostate cancers. Stromal tissues, normal epithelial cells and prostate intraepithelial neoplasia (PIN) of any grade around and distant from cancer were always negative for reelin. Reelin was found in malignant prostatic epithelial glands of 50% cases Gleason score 10, 52% Gleason score 9, 56% Gleason score 8, 18% Gleason score 7, while no sample of prostate cancers with Gleason score 6 showed reelin expression (P=0,005). As reelin staining is frequently found in high Gleason score prostate cancers, we explored whether reelin expression is influenced by single Gleason patterns. While Gleason 3 pattern did not show reelin immunoreactivity, reelin expression was found in 35% Gleason 4 patterns and 45% Gleason 5 patterns (P<0.001). Our results demonstrated for the first time that reelin is expressed in prostate cancer and not in benign prostate tissue and its expression occurs in higher Gleason score and correlates significantly with increasing of single Gleason patterns. This suggests reelin may behave as a specific histological marker and may represent a useful biomarker to predict aggressive phenotypic behavior of prostatic cancer cells.

To compare histological feature of prostate cancer (PCa) according androgenic status in patients who underwent radical prostatectomy (RP). Between March 2007 and September 2013, we prospectively analysed 937 patients who were referred to our centre for RP. Clinical, pathological and biological data have been prospectively collected. Preoperative total testosterone (TT) and bioavailable testosterone (BT) serum determinations were carried out. The threshold for low serum testosterone was set at TT<3 ng/ml. Preoperative PSA value was registered. Gleason score (GS) and predominant Gleason pattern were determined in prostate biopsies and in prostate tissue specimens, crosschecked by two uro-pathologists. Nine hundred and thirty-seven consecutive patients were included. In all, 14.9% patients had low TT in the population. An exact match between biopsy and prostate specimens in GS grading was observed for 50.6% patients (n=474). Also, 40.9% of all patients were upgraded (n=383): 45.3% (n=63) in low serum testosterone patients and 40.1% (n=320) in normal serum testosterone patients. For prostate specimens, the proportion of patients with predominant Gleason pattern 4 was higher in patients with low TT compared with normal TT (41.7% vs 29.1%, P=0.0029). In all, 20.1% were upgraded from predominant Gleason pattern 3 on biopsies specimen to predominant Gleason 4 pattern on the prostate specimen in patients with low TT, whereas 11.6% were upgraded for normal TT patients (P=0.002). Low serum testosterone is an independent risk factor for predominant Gleason pattern 4 on prostate specimen after RP and for upgrading from low- to high-grade cancer between prostate needle biopsies and RP specimen. This observation should be taken into account in localised PCa management, especially for active surveillance or when a nerve-sparing approach is considered.
