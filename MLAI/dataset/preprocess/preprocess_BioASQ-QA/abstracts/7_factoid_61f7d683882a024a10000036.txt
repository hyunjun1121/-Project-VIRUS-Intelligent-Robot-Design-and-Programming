Arachidyl amido cholanoic acid (Aramchol) is a potent downregulator of hepatic stearoyl-CoA desaturase 1 (SCD1) protein expression that reduces liver triglycerides and fibrosis in animal models of steatohepatitis. In a phase IIb clinical trial in patients with nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH), 52 wk of treatment with Aramchol reduced blood levels of glycated hemoglobin A1c, an indicator of glycemic control. To assess lipid and glucose metabolism in mouse hepatocytes and in a NASH mouse model [induced with a 0.1% methionine and choline deficient diet (0.1MCD)] after treatment with Aramchol. Isolated primary mouse hepatocytes were incubated with 20 μmol/L Aramchol or vehicle for 48 h. Subsequently, analyses were performed including Western blot, proteomics by mass spectrometry, and fluxomic analysis with <sup>13</sup>C-uniformly labeled glucose. For the <i>in vivo</i> part of the study, male C57BL/6J mice were randomly fed a control or 0.1MCD for 4 wk and received 1 or 5 mg/kg/d Aramchol or vehicle by intragastric gavage for the last 2 wk. Liver metabolomics were assessed using ultra-high-performance liquid chromatography-time of flight-MS for the determination of glucose metabolism-related metabolites. Combination of proteomics and Western blot analyses showed increased AMPK activity while the activity of nutrient sensor mTORC1 was decreased by Aramchol in hepatocytes. This translated into changes in the content of their downstream targets including proteins involved in fatty acid (FA) synthesis and oxidation [P-ACCα/β(S79), SCD1, CPT1A/B, HADHA, and HADHB], oxidative phosphorylation (NDUFA9, NDUFB11, NDUFS1, NDUFV1, ETFDH, and UQCRC2), tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle (MDH2, SUCLA2, and SUCLG2), and ribosome (P-p70S6K[T389] and P-S6[S235/S236]). Flux experiments with <sup>13</sup>C-uniformely labeled glucose showed that TCA cycle cataplerosis was reduced by Aramchol in hepatocytes, as indicated by the increase in the number of rounds that malate remained in the TCA cycle. Finally, liver metabolomic analysis showed that glucose homeostasis was improved by Aramchol in 0.1MCD fed mice in a dose-dependent manner, showing normalization of glucose, G6P, F6P, UDP-glucose, and Rbl5P/Xyl5P. Aramchol exerts its effect on glucose and lipid metabolism in NASH through activation of AMPK and inhibition of mTORC1, which in turn activate FA β-oxidation and oxidative phosphorylation.

Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is of increasing prevalence globally. While lifestyle modifications are recommended, many patients do not succeed to achieve significant and maintained weight loss from lifestyle and as such there is a high unmet need for pharmacotherapy in this group. Comparable to other metabolic diseases including diabetes and dyslipidaemia, a high proportion of patients will likely benefit from permanent pharmacological therapy. Currently there are many compounds with different mechanisms of action in clinical development including metabolic, anti-inflammatory and anti-fibrotic drugs. A number of phase 3 clinical trials are currently ongoing including Elafibranor, a dual PPAR α/δ agonist, Cenicriviroc, a CCR2/CCR5 chemokine antagonist, the nuclear bile acid receptor FXR agonist obeticholic acid, Aramchol, a fatty acid bile acid conjugate that modulates SCD-1, and Resmetrion, a liver-specific THR-β agonist. Further studies with promising pathophysiological mechanisms of action, e. g. the ASK-1 inhibitor Selonsertib or the caspase inhibitor Emricasan have shown negative results. However, some are being further evaluated in combination therapies. The complex pathophysiology of the disease, which combines inflammation, metabolism and fibrosis, has led to the fact that even combinations of several substances are investigated with different modes of action. This review summarizes pivotal clinical trials for patients with NASH in the absence of cirrhosis which are recruiting in the fall of 2019.

Nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) is the advanced form of nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) which sets the stage for further liver damage. The mechanism for the progression of NASH involves multiple parallel hits including oxidative stress, mitochondrial dysfunction, inflammation and others. Manipulation of any of these pathways may be an approach to prevent NASH development and progression. Aramchol (arachidyl-amido cholanoic acid) is presently in a phase IIb NASH study. The aim of this study was to investigate Aramchol's mechanism of action and its effect on fibrosis using the methionine- and choline-deficient (MCD) diet model of NASH. We collected liver and serum from mice fed a MCD diet containing 0.1% methionine (0.1MCD) for four weeks, which developed steatohepatitis and fibrosis, as well as mice receiving a control diet; the metabolomes and proteomes were determined. 0.1MCD fed mice were given Aramchol (5mg/kg/day for the last 2 weeks); liver samples were analyzed histologically. Aramchol administration reduced features of steatohepatitis and fibrosis in 0.1MCD fed mice. Aramchol downregulated stearoyl-CoA desaturase 1 (SCD1), a key enzyme involved in triglyceride biosynthesis whose loss enhances fatty acid β-oxidation. Aramchol increased the flux through the transsulfuration pathway, leading to a rise in glutathione (GSH) and GSH/GSSG ratio, the main cellular antioxidant that maintains intracellular redox status. Comparison of serum metabolomic pattern between 0.1MCD fed mice and NAFLD patients showed a substantial overlap. Aramchol treatment improved steatohepatitis and fibrosis by 1) decreasing SCD1, and 2) increasing the flux through the transsulfuration pathway maintaining cellular redox homeostasis. We also demonstrated that the 0.1MCD model resembles the metabolic phenotype observed in about 50% of NAFLD patients, which supports the potential use of Aramchol in NASH treatment.

Aramchol, an oral stearoyl-coenzyme-A-desaturase-1 inhibitor, has been shown to reduce hepatic fat content in patients with primary nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD); however, its effect in patients with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-associated NAFLD is unknown. The aramchol for HIV-associated NAFLD and lipodystrophy (ARRIVE) trial was a double-blind, randomized, investigator-initiated, placebo-controlled trial to test the efficacy of 12 weeks of treatment with aramchol versus placebo in HIV-associated NAFLD. Fifty patients with HIV-associated NAFLD, defined by magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)-proton density fat fraction (PDFF) ≥5%, were randomized to receive either aramchol 600 mg daily (n = 25) or placebo (n = 25) for 12 weeks. The primary endpoint was a change in hepatic fat as measured by MRI-PDFF in colocalized regions of interest. Secondary endpoints included changes in liver stiffness using magnetic resonance elastography (MRE) and vibration-controlled transient elastography (VCTE), and exploratory endpoints included changes in total-body fat and muscle depots on dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA), whole-body MRI, and cardiac MRI. The mean (± standard deviation) of age and body mass index were 48.2 ± 10.3 years and 30.7 ± 4.6 kg/m<sup>2</sup> , respectively. There was no difference in the reduction in mean MRI-PDFF between the aramchol group at -1.3% (baseline MRI-PDFF 15.6% versus end-of-treatment MRI-PDFF 14.4%, P = 0.24) and the placebo group at -1.4% (baseline MRI-PDFF 13.3% versus end-of-treatment MRI-PDFF 11.9%, P = 0.26). There was no difference in the relative decline in mean MRI-PDFF between the aramchol and placebo groups (6.8% versus 1.1%, P = 0.68). There were no differences in MRE-derived and VCTE-derived liver stiffness and whole-body (fat and muscle) composition analysis by MRI or DXA. Compared to baseline, end-of-treatment aminotransferases were lower in the aramchol group but not in the placebo arm. There were no significant adverse events. Conclusion: Aramchol, over a 12-week period, did not reduce hepatic fat or change body fat and muscle composition by using MRI-based assessment in patients with HIV-associated NAFLD (clinicaltrials.gov ID:NCT02684591).

Nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH), a chronic liver disease without an approved therapy, is associated with lipotoxicity and insulin resistance and is a major cause of cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma. Aramchol, a partial inhibitor of hepatic stearoyl-CoA desaturase (SCD1) improved steatohepatitis and fibrosis in rodents and reduced steatosis in an early clinical trial. ARREST, a 52-week, double-blind, placebo-controlled, phase 2b trial randomized 247 patients with NASH (n = 101, n = 98 and n = 48 in the Aramchol 400 mg, 600 mg and placebo arms, respectively; NCT02279524 ). The primary end point was a decrease in hepatic triglycerides by magnetic resonance spectroscopy at 52 weeks with a dose of 600 mg of Aramchol. Key secondary end points included liver histology and alanine aminotransferase (ALT). Aramchol 600 mg produced a placebo-corrected decrease in liver triglycerides without meeting the prespecified significance (-3.1, 95% confidence interval (CI) -6.4 to 0.2, P = 0.066), precluding further formal statistical analysis. NASH resolution without worsening fibrosis was achieved in 16.7% (13 out of 78) of Aramchol 600 mg versus 5% (2 out of 40) of the placebo arm (odds ratio (OR) = 4.74, 95% CI = 0.99 to 22.7) and fibrosis improvement by ≥1 stage without worsening NASH in 29.5% versus 17.5% (OR = 1.88, 95% CI = 0.7 to 5.0), respectively. The placebo-corrected decrease in ALT for 600 mg was -29.1 IU l<sup>-1</sup> (95% CI = -41.6 to -16.5). Early termination due to adverse events (AEs) was <5%, and Aramchol 600 and 400 mg were safe, well tolerated and without imbalance in serious or severe AEs between arms. Although the primary end point of a reduction in liver fat did not meet the prespecified significance level with Aramchol 600 mg, the observed safety and changes in liver histology and enzymes provide a rationale for SCD1 modulation as a promising therapy for NASH and fibrosis and are being evaluated in an ongoing phase 3 program.

Suppression of stearoyl-coenzyme A desaturase (SCD) activity leads to reduction of obesity, fatty liver as well as of insulin resistance. It was, however, recently reported to enhance atherogenesis. The aim of the present study was to investigate whether inhibition of SCD by Aramchol, a fatty acid bile conjugate with known hypocholesterolemic effects, will affect atherogenesis and how. Aramchol was tested in vitro in cultured cells and in vivo in rodents. Aramchol, at very low concentrations, reduced SCD activity in liver microsomes of mice. Aramchol enhanced cholesterol efflux from macrophages more than twofold. In vivo it increased fecal sterol output and decreased markedly plasma cholesterol levels in mice. In ApoE(-/-), LDRL(-/-) and C57Bl6 mice, the effects of Aramchol on atherogenesis were non-atherogenic. Aramchol reduces SCD activity and is non-atherogenic. It may offer a means to obtain the desirable hepatic metabolic effects of SCD inhibition without the deleterious atherogenic effect.

Aramchol is a fatty acid-bile acid conjugate that reduces liver fat content and is being evaluated in a phase III clinical trial for non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH). Aramchol attenuates NASH in mouse models and decreases steatosis by downregulating the fatty acid synthetic enzyme stearoyl CoA desaturase 1 (SCD1) in hepatocytes. Although hepatic stellate cells (HSCs) also store lipids as retinyl esters, the impact of Aramchol in this cell type is unknown. We investigated the effects of Aramchol on a human HSC line (LX-2), primary human HSCs (phHSCs), and primary human hepatocytes (phHeps). In LX-2 and phHSCs, 10 μM Aramchol significantly reduced <i>SCD1</i> mRNA while inducing <i>PPARG</i> (<i>PPARγ</i>) mRNA, with parallel changes in the 2 proteins; <i>ACTA2</i>, <i>COL1A1</i>, <i>β-PDGFR</i> (<i>bPDGFR</i>) mRNAs were also significantly reduced in LX-2. Secretion of collagen 1 (Col1α1) was inhibited by 10 μM Aramchol. <i>SCD1</i> knockdown in LX-2 cells phenocopied the effect of Aramchol by reducing fibrogenesis, and addition of Aramchol to these cells did not rescue fibrogenic gene expression. Conversely, in LX-2 overexpressing SCD1, Aramchol no longer suppressed fibrogenic gene expression. The drug also induced genes in LX-2 that promote cholesterol efflux and inhibited <i>ACAT2</i>, which catalyses cholesterol synthesis. In phHeps, Aramchol also reduced <i>SCD1</i> and increased <i>PPARG</i> mRNA expression. Aramchol downregulates <i>SCD1</i> and elevates <i>PPARG</i> in HSCs, reducing <i>COL1A1</i> and <i>ACTA2</i> mRNAs and COL1A1 secretion. These data suggest a direct inhibitory effect of Aramchol in HSCs through SCD1 inhibition, as part of a broader impact on both fibrogenic genes as well as mediators of cholesterol homeostasis. These findings illustrate novel mechanisms of Aramchol activity, including potential antifibrotic activity in patients with NASH and fibrosis. In this study, we have explored the potential activity of Aramchol, a drug currently in clinical trials for fatty liver disease, in blocking fibrosis, or scarring, by hepatic stellate cells, the principal collagen-producing (<i>i.e.</i> fibrogenic) cell type in liver injury. In both isolated human hepatic stellate cells and in a human hepatic stellate cell line, the drug suppresses the key fat-producing enzyme, stearoyl CoA desaturase 1 (SCD1), which leads to reduced expression of genes and proteins associated with hepatic fibrosis, while inducing the protective gene, PPARγ. The drug loses activity when SCD1 is already reduced by gene knockdown, reinforcing the idea that inhibition of SCD1 is a main mode of activity for Aramchol. These findings strengthen the rationale for testing Aramchol in patients with NASH.
