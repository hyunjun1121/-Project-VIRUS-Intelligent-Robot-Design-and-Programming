Patients with secondary acute myeloid leukemia (sAML) arising from myelodysplastic syndromes have a poor prognosis marked by an increased resistance to chemotherapy. An urgent need exists for adjuvant treatments that can enhance or replace current therapeutic options. Here we show the potential of LB100, a small-molecule protein phosphatase 2 A (PP2A) inhibitor, as a monotherapy and chemosensitizing agent for sAML using an in-vitro and in-vivo approach. We demonstrate that LB100 decreases cell viability through caspase activation and G2/M cell-cycle arrest. LB100 enhances daunorubicin (DNR) cytotoxicity resulting in decreased xenograft volumes and improved overall survival. LB100 profoundly upregulates miR-181b-1, which we show directly binds to the 3' untranslated region of Bcl-2 mRNA leading to its translational inhibition. MiR-181b-1 ectopic overexpression further diminishes Bcl-2 expression leading to suppression of sAML cell growth, and enhancement of DNR cytotoxicity. Our research highlights the therapeutic potential of LB100, and provides new insights into the mechanism of LB100 chemosensitization.
