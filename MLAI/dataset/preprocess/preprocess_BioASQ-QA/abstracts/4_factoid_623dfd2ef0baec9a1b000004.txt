The lectin chaperones calnexin (CNX) and calreticulin (CRT) localized in the endoplasmic reticulum play important roles in glycoprotein quality control. Although the interaction between these lectin chaperones and ERp57 is well known, it has been recently reported that endoplasmic reticulum protein 29 (ERp29), a member of PDI family, interacts with CNX and CRT. The biochemical function of ERp29 is unclear because it exhibits no ERp57-like redox activity. In this study, we addressed the possibility that ER chaperones CNX and CRT are connected via ERp29, based on our observation that ERp29 exists as a dimer. As a result, we showed that CNX dimerizes through ERp29. These results endorse the hypothesis that ERp29 serves as a bridge that links two molecules of CNX. Also, we showed that similar complexes such as CNX-CRT were formed via ERp29.

Calreticulin (CRT), an endoplasmic reticulum-resident protein generally overexpressed in cancer cells, is associated with radiation resistance. CRT shows higher transacetylase activity, as shown by us earlier, in the presence of the polyphenolic acetates (like 7, 8-diacetoxy-4-methylcoumarin, DAMC) and modifies the activity of a number of proteins, thereby influencing cell signaling. To investigate the relationship between CRT expression and radiation response in a human glioma cell line and to evaluate the radiomodifying effects of DAMC. Studies were carried out in an established human glioma cell line (BMG-1) and its isogenic clone overexpressing CRT (CROE, CRT-overexpressing cells) by analyzing clonogenic survival, cell proliferation, micronuclei analysis, and protein levels by Western blotting as parameters of responses. CRT overexpression conferred resistance against radiation-induced cell death in CROE cells (D<sub>37</sub>  = 7.35 Gy, D<sub>10</sub>  = 12.6 Gy and D<sub>0</sub>  = 7.25 Gy) as compared to BMG-1 cells (D<sub>37</sub>  = 5.70 Gy, D<sub>10</sub>  = 9.2 Gy and D<sub>0</sub>  = 5.6 Gy). A lower level of radiation-induced micronuclei formation observed in CROE cells suggested that reduced induction and/or enhanced DNA repair partly contributed to the enhanced radioresistance. Consistent with this suggestion, we noted that CRT-mediated radioresistance was coupled with enhanced grp78 level and reduced P53 activation-mediated prodeath signaling, while no changes were noted in acetylation of histone H4. DAMC-enhanced radiation-induced delayed (secondary) apoptosis, which was higher in CROE cells. CRT overexpression confers resistance against radiation-induced death of human glioma cells, which can be overcome by the polyphenolic acetate DAMC.

N-glycosylation is a highly conserved glycan modification, and more than 7000 proteins are N-glycosylated in humans. N-glycosylation has many biological functions such as protein folding, trafficking, and signal transduction. Thus, glycan modification to proteins is profoundly involved in numerous physiological and pathological processes. The N-glycan precursor is biosynthesized in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) from dolichol phosphate by sequential enzymatic reactions to generate the dolichol-linked oligosaccharide composed of 14 sugar residues, Glc<sub>3</sub>Man<sub>9</sub>GlcNAc<sub>2</sub>. The oligosaccharide is then en bloc transferred to the consensus sequence N-X-S/T (X represents any amino acid except proline) of nascent proteins. Subsequently, the N-glycosylated nascent proteins enter the folding step, in which N-glycans contribute largely to attaining the correct protein fold by recruiting the lectin-like chaperones, calnexin, and calreticulin. Despite the N-glycan-dependent folding process, some glycoproteins do not fold correctly, and these misfolded glycoproteins are destined to degradation by proteasomes in the cytosol. Properly folded proteins are transported to the Golgi, and N-glycans undergo maturation by the sequential reactions of glycosidases and glycosyltransferases, generating complex-type N-glycans. N-Acetylglucosaminyltransferases (GnT-III, GnT-IV, and GnT-V) produce branched N-glycan structures, affording a higher complexity to N-glycans. In this chapter, we provide an overview of the biosynthetic pathway of N-glycans in the ER and Golgi.

Calreticulin (CALR) is an endoplasmic reticulum (ER)-resident protein involved in a spectrum of cellular processes. In healthy cells, CALR operates as a chaperone and Ca<sup>2+</sup> buffer to assist correct protein folding within the ER. Besides favoring the maintenance of cellular proteostasis, these cell-intrinsic CALR functions support Ca<sup>2+</sup>-dependent processes, such as adhesion and integrin signaling, and ensure normal antigen presentation on MHC Class I molecules. Moreover, cancer cells succumbing to immunogenic cell death (ICD) expose CALR on their surface, which promotes the uptake of cell corpses by professional phagocytes and ultimately supports the initiation of anticancer immunity. Thus, loss-of-function CALR mutations promote oncogenesis not only as they impair cellular homeostasis in healthy cells, but also as they compromise natural and therapy-driven immunosurveillance. However, the prognostic impact of total or membrane-exposed CALR levels appears to vary considerably with cancer type. For instance, while genetic CALR defects promote pre-neoplastic myeloproliferation, patients with myeloproliferative neoplasms bearing CALR mutations often experience improved overall survival as compared to patients bearing wild-type CALR. Here, we discuss the context-dependent impact of CALR on malignant transformation, tumor progression and response to cancer therapy.
