To clarify the spatial relationship between coronary microvascular dysfunction and myocardial fibrosis in hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM), we compared the measurement of hyperemic myocardial blood flow (hMBF) by PET with the extent of delayed contrast enhancement (DCE) detected by MRI. In 34 patients with HCM, PET was performed using (13)N-labeled ammonia during hyperemia induced by intravenous dipyridamole. DCE and systolic thickening were assessed by MRI. Left ventricular myocardial segments were classified as with DCE, either transmural (DCE-T) or nontransmural (DCE-NT), and without DCE, either contiguous to DCE segments (NoDCE-C) or remote from them (NoDCE-R). In the group with DCE, hMBF was significantly lower than in the group without DCE (1.81 +/- 0.94 vs. 2.13 +/- 1.11 mL/min/g; P < 0.001). DCE-T segments had lower hMBF than did DCE-NT segments (1.43 +/- 0.52 vs. 1.91 +/- 1 mL/min/g, P < 0.001). Similarly, NoDCE-C segments had lower hMBF than did NoDCE-R (1.98 +/- 1.10 vs. 2.29 +/- 1.10 mL/min/g, P < 0.01) and had no significant difference from DCE-NT segments. Severe coronary microvascular dysfunction (hMBF in the lowest tertile of all segments) was more prevalent among NoDCE-C than NoDCE-R segments (33% vs. 24%, P < 0.05). Systolic thickening was inversely correlated with percentage transmurality of DCE (Spearman rho = -0.37, P < 0.0001) and directly correlated with hMBF (Spearman rho = 0.20, P < 0.0001). In myocardial segments exhibiting DCE, hMBF is reduced. DCE extent is inversely correlated and hMBF directly correlated with systolic thickening. In segments without DCE but contiguous to DCE areas, hMBF is significantly lower than in those remote from DCE and is similar to the value obtained in nontransmural DCE segments. These results suggest that increasing degrees of coronary microvascular dysfunction might play a causative role for myocardial fibrosis in HCM.

Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM) is reported to show patchy midwall myocardial hyperenhancement on delayed-enhancement magnetic resonance imaging (DE-MRI). The intramural distribution of myocardial hyperenhancement and its correlation with clinical symptoms, ventricular arrhythmias, and cardiac function have not been described forsymptomatic apical HCM. To evaluate the features and significance of myocardial hyperenhancement on DE-MRI insymptomatic apical HCM. Thirteen patients with symptomatic apical HCM and their 65 apical segments were investigated. Myocardial hyperenhancement and regional and global functional parameters were determined with MRI. We investigated the intramural distribution and frequencies of this myocardial hyperenhancement and compared them with the patients' clinical symptoms, the presence of ventricular arrhythmias, and cine MRI. Eight (61.5%) patients with symptomatic apical HCM displayed apical myocardial hyperenhancement, and 22 (33.8%) of the 65 apical segments examined showed myocardial hyperenhancement. Of the myocardial hyperenhancement observed, 81.8% showed a subendocardial pattern.The hyperenhanced apical myocardium had a lower percentage of systolic myocardial thickening, and was associated with serious symptoms (e.g. syncope) and ventricular arrhythmias. Patients with symptomatic apical HCMshowed myocardial hyperenhancement involving the subendocardial layer, which might be related to regional systolic dysfunction, serious clinical symptoms, and ventricular arrhythmias.

The aim of the present study was to evaluate, in patients with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HC), the association between late gadolinium enhancement and clinical end points, such as nonsustained ventricular tachycardia, arrhythmic risk factors, New York Heart Association class, symptoms, and left ventricular functional parameters. A total of 20 normal subjects (mean age 38 years, 16 men) and 100 patients with HC (mean age 46 years, 70 men) were enrolled in the present study. In the late gadolinium enhancement images, the extent of unenhanced, mildly enhanced, and higher enhanced myocardium was measured. Higher enhancement was present in 80% of the HC population and was significantly greater in patients with a New York Heart Association class >1. Mild enhancement was present in all the patients with HC. Receiver operating characteristic analysis revealed that a cutoff of >4.9% of mild enhancement had 100% sensitivity and 86% specificity to predict the occurrence of nonsustained ventricular tachycardia, and a cutoff of >2.4% of hyperenhancement had 77% sensitivity and 96% specificity. In conclusion, late gadolinium enhancement was associated with nonsustained ventricular tachycardia, arrhythmic risk factors, and worse New York Heart Association class.

Our aim was to determine whether myocardial fibrosis, detected by cardiovascular magnetic resonance (CMR), represents an arrhythmogenic substrate in hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM). Myocardial fibrosis is identified frequently in HCM; however, the clinical significance of this finding is uncertain. We studied prevalence and frequency of tachyarrhythmias on 24-h ambulatory Holter electrocardiogram (ECG) with regard to delayed enhancement (DE) on contrast-enhanced CMR in 177 HCM patients (age 41 +/- 16 yrs; 95% asymptomatic or mildly symptomatic). Premature ventricular contractions (PVCs), couplets, and nonsustained ventricular tachycardia (NSVT) were more common in patients with DE than those without DE (PVCs: 89% vs. 72%; couplets: 40% vs. 17%; NSVT: 28% vs. 4%; p < 0.0001 to 0.007). Patients with DE also had greater numbers of PVCs (202 +/- 655 vs. 116 +/- 435), couplets (1.9 +/- 5 vs. 1.2 +/- 10), and NSVT runs (0.4 +/- 0.8 vs. 0.06 +/- 0.4) than non-DE patients (all p < 0.0001); DE was an independent predictor of NSVT (relative risk 7.3, 95% confidence interval 2.6 to 20.4; p < 0.0001). However, extent (%) of DE was similar in patients with and without PVCs (8.2% vs. 9.1%; p = 0.93), couplets (8.5% vs. 8.4%; p = 0.99), or NSVT (8.3% vs. 8.5%; p = 0.35). In this large HCM cohort with no or only mild symptoms, myocardial fibrosis detected by CMR was associated with greater likelihood and increased frequency of ventricular tachyarrhythmias (including NSVT) on ambulatory Holter ECG. Therefore, contrast-enhanced CMR identifies HCM patients with increased susceptibility to ventricular tachyarrhythmias.

The clinical, morphological, and electrocardiographical relevance of delayed enhancement (DE) in cardiac magnetic resonance (CMR) was studied in patients with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM). A total of 56 patients underwent both gadolinium-enhanced CMR and 12-lead electrocardiogram. The CMR demonstrated DE at the left ventricular (LV) wall in 39 patients. The patients with DE included more cases with dilated phase of HCM, higher New York Heart Association (NYHA) classes and incidence of ventricular tachyarrhythmias (VT), lower LV ejection fraction (LVEF) and mean LV wall thickness (WT), and a larger ratio of maximum to minimum LVWT. The QRS duration was prolonged and the QRS axis deviated toward left with increases in the DE volume (r = 0.58 and r = 0.41, P < .01). Abnormal Q waves were present in 5 patients and the location coincided with the DE segments in 4 patients, but the concordance was not significant. The amplitude of T waves correlated with the ratio of the apex to basal LVWT (r = 0.38, P < .01) and was more negative in cases with DE at the apex. In HCM, the DE was associated with higher NYHA classes and prevalence of VT, impaired global LV function and asymmetrical hypertrophy, and conduction disturbance, abnormal Q waves, and giant negative T waves.

Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM) is a disease that typically has heterogeneous hypertrophy and dysfunction of the myocardium. Cardiac magnetic resonance imaging (CMR) can be used to accurately assess ventricular wall thickness and regional fibrosis. We investigated the effects of hypertrophy and fibrosis on the heterogeneity of regional and global myocardial function in HCM. Forty patients who were diagnosed with HCM were consecutively enrolled. Echocardiography and CMR with delayed hyper-enhancement imaging (DHE) was performed for each patient. Left ventricular (LV) regional and global longitudinal strain (SL(R) and SL(G)) were obtained by two-dimensional speckle tracking method on echocardiography. With CMR, regional myocardial wall thickness was measured, and the amount of DHE was calculated semi-quantitatively in each segment. Overall, 720 segments were analyzed. SL(R) was significantly decreased in the hypertrophied segments (thickness > 11 mm) and segments with DHE (P < 0.001). SL(R) was correlated with myocardial wall thickness (r = 0.47, P = 0.001) and amount of regional DHE (r = 0.39, P < 0.001). On multivariate analysis, regional LV wall thickness and amount of DHE were the only independent determinants of SL(R). SL(G) was associated with LV diastolic functional parameters in echocardiography, total DHE volume, and LV mass index. Total DHE volume and LV mass index were independent determinants of SL(G) on multivariate analysis. The extent of regional myocardial fibrosis is associated with regional myocardial function independently of morphological changes of the myocardium, and the correlation extended to global LV function. In this context, DHE may be a useful parameter to discover early myocardial dysfunction independently of LV hypertrophy.

Contrast-enhanced cardiovascular magnetic resonance with delayed enhancement (DE) can provide in vivo assessment of myocardial fibrosis. However, the clinical significance of DE in hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM) remains unresolved. Cine and cardiovascular magnetic resonance with DE were performed in 202 HCM patients (mean age, 42+/-17 years; 71% male), DE was compared with clinical and demographic variables, and patients were followed up for 681+/-249 days for adverse disease events. DE was identified in 111 (55%) HCM patients, occupying 9%+/-11% of left ventricular myocardial volume, including >25% DE in 10% of patients. The presence of DE was related to occurrence of heart failure symptoms (P=0.05) and left ventricular systolic dysfunction (P=0.001). DE was present in all patients with ejection fraction < or =50% but also in 53% (102/192) of patients with preserved ejection fraction (P<0.001); %DE was both inversely related to (r=-0.3; P<0.001) and an independent predictor of ejection fraction (r=-0.4; P<0.001). DE (7%+/-7% of left ventricle) was present in 54 patients who were asymptomatic (and with normal ejection fraction). Over the follow-up period, the annualized adverse cardiovascular event rate in patients with DE exceeded that in patients without DE but did not achieve statistical significance (5.5% versus 3.3%; P=0.5). In a large HCM cohort, DE was an independent predictor of systolic dysfunction but with only a modest relationship to heart failure symptoms. These data suggest an important role for myocardial fibrosis in the clinical course of HCM patients but are not sufficient at this time to consider DE as an independent risk factor for adverse prognosis.

The aim of this study was to assess LA function by two-dimensional speckle-tracking echocardiography and its relation with myocardial fibrosis in hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM). We enrolled 30 consecutive HCM-patients in our study (20 males; age: 49.7 +/- 10.4 years, NYHA-class: 1.9 +/- 0.7). Echocardiography was performed with assessment of global longitudinal LV strain (epsilon) and LA epsilon and strain-rate parameters (systolic, early diastolic, and late diastolic during atrial contraction). Each patient received delayed-enhancement magnetic resonance imaging (DE-MRI) to check for myocardial fibrosis. We divided the patients into two groups. Patients of group 1 had no fibrosis, group 2 demonstrated moderate or severe fibrosis in > or = 2 segments using a 17 segment-model of the LV. Moderate and severe fibrosis was observed in 20 patients (group 2: 66.7%). Global longitudinal LV epsilon (-13.0 +/- 2.4 vs -20.6 +/- 3.2%, P < 0.001) and peak LA epsilon (-0.2 +/- 3.9 vs 17.9 +/- 6.7%, P < 0.001) were reduced in group 2 in comparison with patients without myocardial fibrosis. In all patients peak LA epsilon correlated with global longitudinal LV epsilon (r = -0.78, P < 0.001). Patients with considerable myocardial fibrosis (group 2) had a higher indexed left atrial volume (35.7 +/- 12.8 ml/m2 vs 24.1 +/- 8.6 ml/m2, P = 0.016). New York Heart Association class (NYHA) was higher in patients with severe myocardial fibrosis (2.2 +/- 0.7 vs 1.3 +/- 0.5) and correlated with peak LA (r = -0.5, P = 0.008) and global LV epsilon (r = 0.5, P = 0.005). Occurrence of myocardial fibrosis in hypertrophic cardiomyopathy is associated with left atrial and ventricular dysfunction as well as with the severity of heart failure symptoms.
