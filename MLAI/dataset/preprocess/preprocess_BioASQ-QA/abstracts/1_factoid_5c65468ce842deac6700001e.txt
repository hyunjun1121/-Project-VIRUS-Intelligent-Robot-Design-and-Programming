Human T-lymphotropic virus type 1 (HTLV-1) causes the debilitating neuroinflammatory disease HTLV-1-associated myelopathy-tropical spastic paraparesis (HAM-TSP) as well as adult T-cell leukemia-lymphoma (ATLL). In patients with HAM-TSP, HTLV-1 infects mainly CCR4+ T cells and induces functional changes, ultimately causing chronic spinal cord inflammation. We evaluated mogamulizumab, a humanized anti-CCR4 monoclonal antibody that targets infected cells, in patients with HAM-TSP. In this uncontrolled, phase 1-2a study, we assessed the safety, pharmacokinetics, and efficacy of mogamulizumab in patients with glucocorticoid-refractory HAM-TSP. In the phase 1 dose-escalation study, 21 patients received a single infusion of mogamulizumab (at doses of 0.003 mg per kilogram of body weight, 0.01 mg per kilogram, 0.03 mg per kilogram, 0.1 mg per kilogram, or 0.3 mg per kilogram) and were observed for 85 days. Of those patients, 19 continued on to the phase 2a study and received infusions, over a period of 24 weeks, of 0.003 mg per kilogram, 0.01 mg per kilogram, or 0.03 mg per kilogram at 8-week intervals or infusions of 0.1 mg per kilogram or 0.3 mg per kilogram at 12-week intervals. The side effects of mogamulizumab did not limit administration up to the maximum dose (0.3 mg per kilogram). The most frequent side effects were grade 1 or 2 rash (in 48% of the patients) and lymphopenia and leukopenia (each in 33%). The dose-dependent reduction in the proviral load in peripheral-blood mononuclear cells (decrease by day 15 of 64.9%; 95% confidence interval [CI], 51.7 to 78.1) and inflammatory markers in cerebrospinal fluid (decrease by day 29 of 37.3% [95% CI, 24.8 to 49.8] in the CXCL10 level and of 21.0% [95% CI, 10.7 to 31.4] in the neopterin level) was maintained with additional infusions throughout the phase 2a study. A reduction in spasticity was noted in 79% of the patients and a decrease in motor disability in 32%. Mogamulizumab decreased the number of HTLV-1-infected cells and the levels of inflammatory markers. Rash was the chief side effect. The effect of mogamulizumab on clinical HAM-TSP needs to be clarified in future studies.
