Immunotherapy has demonstrated encouraging clinical benefits in patients with advanced breast carcinomas and Programmed death ligand 1 (PD-L1) expression has been proposed as an immunotherapy biomarker. Challenges with current PD-L1 testing exist and tumor mutation burden (TMB) is emerging as a biomarker to predict clinical response to immunotherapy in melanoma and non-small cell lung cancer patients. However, TMB has not been well characterized in breast carcinomas. The study cohort included 62 advanced breast cancer patients (13 primary and 49 metastatic). Genetic alterations and TMB were determined by FoundationOne CDx next generation sequencing (NGS) and the association with clinicopathologic features was analyzed. High TMB was observed in a relatively low frequency (3/62, 4.8%). TMB levels were positively associated tumor infiltrating lymphocytes and significantly higher TMB was observed in breast carcinomas with DNA damage repair gene mutation(s). There was no significant association between TMB levels and other analyzed clinicopathologic characteristics. Our data indicate the importance of DNA damage repair proteins in maintaining DNA integrity and immune reaction and breast carcinoma patients with DDR mutation may benefit from immunotherapy.
