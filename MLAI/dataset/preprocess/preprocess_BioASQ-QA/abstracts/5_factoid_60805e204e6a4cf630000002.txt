Kleefstra syndrome is a disorder caused by a mutation in the EHMT1 gene characterized in humans by general developmental delay, mild to severe intellectual disability and autism. Here, we characterized cumulative memory in the Ehmt1<sup>+/-</sup> mouse model using the Object Space Task. We combined conventional behavioral analysis with automated analysis by deep-learning networks, a session-based computational learning model, and a trial-based classifier. Ehmt1<sup>+/-</sup> mice showed more anxiety-like features and generally explored objects less, but the difference decreased over time. Interestingly, when analyzing memory-specific exploration, Ehmt1<sup>+/-</sup> show increased expression of cumulative memory, but a deficit in a more simple, control memory condition. Using our automatic classifier to differentiate between genotypes, we found that cumulative memory features are better suited for classification than general exploration differences. Thus, detailed behavioral classification with the Object Space Task produced a more detailed behavioral phenotype of the Ehmt1<sup>+/-</sup> mouse model.

Mutations in the Euchromatic Histone Methyltransferase 1 (EHMT1) gene cause Kleefstra syndrome, a rare form of intellectual disability (ID) with strong autistic traits and sensory processing deficits. Proper development of inhibitory interneurons is crucial for sensory function. Here we report a timeline of Parvalbumin-positive (PV<sup>+</sup>) interneuron development in the three most important sensory cortical areas in the Ehmt1<sup>+/-</sup> mouse. We find a hitherto unreported delay of PV<sup>+</sup> neuron maturation early in sensory development, with layer- and region-specific variability later in development. The delayed PV<sup>+</sup> maturation is also reflected in a delayed maturation of GABAergic transmission in Ehmt1<sup>+/-</sup> auditory cortex, where we find a reduced GABA release probability specifically in putative PV<sup>+</sup> synapses. Together with earlier reports of excitatory impairments in Ehmt1<sup>+/-</sup> neurons, we propose a shift in excitatory-inhibitory balance towards overexcitability in Ehmt1<sup>+/-</sup> sensory cortices as a consequence of early deficits in inhibitory maturation.

Kleefstra syndrome (chromosome 9q34.3 deletion) is a rare genetic disorder with less than 110 patients reported till date. We report a 4-month-old Caucasian girl with Kleefstra syndrome and Shone's complex, an association which has not been previously reported. Surgical planning for patients with Kleefstra syndrome and complex CHD can pose challenges due to an uncertain natural history and a risk of post-operative pulmonary hypertension.

Kleefstra syndrome is a rare neurogenetic disorder caused by a subtelomeric 9q34.3 deletion or by an intragenic mutation of the euchromatin histone methyl transferase 1 gene (EHMT1). Approximately 20% to 30% of individuals have hearing loss. The left temporal bone of one subject with hearing loss was studied using light microscopy. There were several abnormalities including dysostosis of the stapes without fixation, enlarged vestibular aqueduct, anomalies of the organ of Corti in the basal turn, cyst formation in the stria vascularis, and dysmorphia of the cochlear modiolus and the vestibular labyrinth. This is the first published description of the otopathology in Kleefstra syndrome. Laryngoscope, 130:2028-2033, 2020.

Kleefstra syndrome (KS) is an autosomal dominant disorder caused by a chromosomal deletion at 9q34.3 resulting in pathogenic variants of the gene that codes for the enzyme, euchromatin histone methyltransferase 1 (EHMT1). KS is a rare, yet clinically relevant congenital disorder for anesthesiologists because of its potential for cardiac and craniofacial involvement. We present a 3-month-old patient with KS who required anesthetic care for diagnostic laryngoscopy and rigid bronchoscopy. The end-organ effects of KS are reviewed and our anesthetic care presented.
