A fixed-dose combination tablet of the hepatitis C virus (HCV) NS3/4A protease inhibitor (PI) glecaprevir and the HCV NS5A inhibitor pibrentasvir [glecaprevir/pibrentasvir; MAVIRET™ (EU); MAVYRET™ (USA)] has been developed by AbbVie. Oral glecaprevir/pibrentasvir 300 mg/120 mg (three 100 mg/40 mg tablets) taken once daily has been approved by the EMA for the treatment of all major genotypes (genotypes 1-6) of chronic HCV infection in adults. It has also been approved by the US FDA for the treatment of adult patients with chronic HCV genotype 1-6 infection without cirrhosis and with compensated cirrhosis, and for the treatment of adult patients with HCV genotype 1 infection who previously have been treated with a regimen containing either an HCV NS5A inhibitor or an NS3/4A PI, but not both. This article summarizes the milestones in the development of glecaprevir/pibrentasvir leading to its first global approval in the EU and subsequent approval in the USA for chronic HCV infection.

Hepatitis C virus (HCV) therapy that is highly efficacious, pangenotypic, with a high barrier to resistance and short treatment duration is desirable. The efficacy and safety of 8- and 12-week treatments with glecaprevir (ABT-493; NS3/4A protease inhibitor) and pibrentasvir (ABT-530; NS5A inhibitor) were evaluated in non-cirrhotic patients with chronic HCV genotype 1-6 infection. SURVEYOR-I and SURVEYOR-II were phase II, open-label, multicenter, dose-ranging trials including patients with chronic HCV genotype 1-6 infection who were either previously untreated or treated with pegylated interferon plus ribavirin. Patients received once-daily glecaprevir plus pibrentasvir at varying doses with or without ribavirin for 8 or 12weeks. The primary efficacy endpoint was the percentage of patients with a sustained virologic response at post-treatment week 12 (SVR12). Of the 449 patients who received varying doses of glecaprevir plus pibrentasvir, 25%, 29%, 39%, and 8% had HCV genotype 1, 2, 3, and 4-6 infection, respectively. Twelve-week treatment achieved SVR12 in 97-100%, 96-100%, 83-94%, and 100% in genotypes 1, 2, 3, and 4-6, respectively. Eight-week treatment with 300mg glecaprevir plus 120mg pibrentasvir in genotype 1-, 2-, or 3-infected patients yielded 97-98% SVR12 with no virologic failures. Three (0.7%) patients discontinued treatment due to adverse events; most events were mild (grade 1) in severity. No post-nadir alanine aminotransferase elevations were observed. Glecaprevir plus pibrentasvir was well tolerated and achieved high sustained virologic response rates in HCV genotypes 1-6-infected patients without cirrhosis following 8- or 12-week treatment durations. The combination of direct-acting antivirals glecaprevir and pibrentasvir comprise a once-daily, all-oral, pangenotypic treatment for HCV genotype 1-6 infection. This article describes results from two phase II trials investigating a range of doses at treatment durations of 8 or 12weeks in 449 patients without cirrhosis. Efficacy of the optimal dose, as determined by rates of sustained virologic response at post-treatment week 12, ranged from 92%-100%; treatment was well tolerated and significant laboratory abnormalities were rare. clinicaltrials.gov Identifiers: NCT02243280 and NCT02243293. http://www.clinicaltrials.gov/show/NCT02243280, http://www.clinicaltrials.gov/show/NCT01939197.

The combination of glecaprevir (formerly ABT-493), a nonstructural protein 3/4A (NS3/4A) protease inhibitor, and pibrentasvir (formerly ABT-530), an NS5A protein inhibitor, is being developed as treatment for HCV genotype 1 to 6 infection. The pharmacokinetics, pharmacodynamics, safety, and tolerability of methadone or buprenorphine-naloxone when coadministered with the glecaprevir-pibrentasvir combination in HCV-negative subjects on stable opioid maintenance therapy were investigated in a phase 1, single-center, two-arm, multiple-dose, open-label sequential study. Subjects received methadone (arm 1) or buprenorphine-naloxone (arm 2) once daily (QD) per their existing individual prescriptions alone (days 1 to 9) and then in combination with glecaprevir at 300 mg QD and pibrentasvir at 120 mg QD (days 10 to 16) each morning. Dose-normalized exposures were similar with and without glecaprevir and pibrentasvir for (<i>R</i>)- and (<i>S</i>)-methadone (≤5% difference) and for buprenorphine and naloxone (≤24% difference); the norbuprenorphine area under the curve was 30% higher with glecaprevir and pibrentasvir, consistent with maximum and trough plasma concentrations that increased by 21% to 25%. No changes in pupil response, short opiate withdrawal scale score, or desire for drugs questionnaire were observed when glecaprevir and pibrentasvir were added to methadone or buprenorphine-naloxone therapy. No dose adjustment is required when glecaprevir and pibrentasvir are coadministered with methadone or buprenorphine-naloxone.

Glecaprevir and pibrentasvir are pangenotypic direct-acting antiviral agents for the treatment of chronic hepatitis C virus infection. The aim of the present study was to evaluate the drug-drug interaction and safety of glecaprevir and pibrentasvir coadministration in healthy volunteers. In this open-label, randomized, multiple-dose, Phase 1 study in 72 subjects, glecaprevir (100-1200 mg once daily) and pibrentasvir (40-200 mg once daily) were administered alone for 7 days and then in combination for another 7 days. Intensive blood sampling was performed on Days 1, 7, 8, and 14, and pharmacokinetic interactions were assessed using a repeated measures analysis of glecaprevir and pibrentasvir maximum plasma concentration (C <sub>max</sub>) and area under the curve (AUC). Coadministration of glecaprevir 400 mg increased pibrentasvir 120 and 40 mg steady-state C <sub>max</sub> and AUC values to 2.9-6.3-fold, and coadministration of glecaprevir 700 mg increased pibrentasvir 160 mg steady-state C <sub>max</sub> and AUC<sub>24</sub> values to up to sevenfold of the values when pibrentasvir was administered alone. Glecaprevir C <sub>max</sub> and AUC values during coadministration were less than 1.5-fold of the values when glecaprevir was administered alone. The combination of glecaprevir and pibrentasvir at doses up to 400 mg was well tolerated by the healthy subjects in this study. High glecaprevir exposures at 700 and 1200 mg were associated with grade 2/3 elevations in alanine aminotransferase, aspartate aminotransferase, and/or bilirubin. Coadministration of pibrentasvir 120 mg with glecaprevir doses up to 400 mg resulted in increases in pibrentasvir exposures without significant changes in glecaprevir exposures in the absence of any clinically significant laboratory abnormalities.

Chronic hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection is more prevalent among patients who have chronic kidney disease than among those who do not have the disease. Patients with chronic kidney disease who also have HCV infection are at higher risk for progression to end-stage renal disease than those who have chronic kidney disease without HCV infection. Patients with both HCV infection and advanced chronic kidney disease have limited treatment options. We conducted a multicenter, open-label, phase 3 trial to evaluate the efficacy and safety of treatment with the combination of the NS3/4A protease inhibitor glecaprevir and the NS5A inhibitor pibrentasvir for 12 weeks in adults who had HCV genotype 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, or 6 infection and also had compensated liver disease (with or without cirrhosis) with severe renal impairment, dependence on dialysis, or both. Patients had stage 4 or 5 chronic kidney disease and either had received no previous treatment for HCV infection or had received previous treatment with interferon or pegylated interferon, ribavirin, sofosbuvir, or a combination of these medications. The primary end point was a sustained virologic response 12 weeks after the end of treatment. Among the 104 patients enrolled in the trial, 52% had genotype 1 infection, 16% had genotype 2 infection, 11% had genotype 3 infection, 19% had genotype 4 infection, and 2% had genotype 5 or 6 infection. The sustained virologic response rate was 98% (102 of 104 patients; 95% confidence interval, 95 to 100). No patients had virologic failure during treatment, and no patients had a virologic relapse after the end of treatment. Adverse events that were reported in at least 10% of the patients were pruritus, fatigue, and nausea. Serious adverse events were reported in 24% of the patients. Four patients discontinued the trial treatment prematurely because of adverse events; three of these patients had a sustained virologic response. Treatment with glecaprevir and pibrentasvir for 12 weeks resulted in a high rate of sustained virologic response in patients with stage 4 or 5 chronic kidney disease and HCV infection.

To review the role and utility of baseline resistance testing with currently available and pipeline genotype 1 hepatitis C virus (HCV) treatment. Authors reviewed liver meeting abstracts for data on currently-available and pipeline genotype 1 retreatment regimens from January 1, 2015, to March 23, 2017. Additional trials were identified from a review of clinicaltrials.gov using the pipeline medication names. Authors identified reports of current and pipeline genotype 1 retreatment regimens. Seven references were clinical study results presented at the meetings of the American Association for the Study of Liver Diseases and the European Association for the Study of the Liver, and 2 studies were from clinicaltrials.gov . Retreatment trial data of currently available salvage regimens indicate that baseline NS5A resistance-associated substitutions (RASs) may decrease sustained virological response (SVR) rates when retreating with ledipasvir/sofosbuvir but are not affected when using elbasvir/grazoprevir + sofosbuvir + ribavirin, paritaprevir/ritonavir/ombitasvir + dasabuvir + sofosbuvir, or sofosbuvir/velpatasvir + ribavirin. Pipeline data indicate that baseline NS5A RASs do not affect SVR rates when retreating with sofosbuvir/velpatasvir/voxilaprevir or glecaprevir/pibrentasvir. Baseline resistance testing was used for decisional support for 3 clinical scenarios in patients with HCV genotype 1 infection at the time of manuscript submission. Pending the approval of 2 new direct-acting antiviral regimens in the third quarter of 2017, the rapidly evolving HCV treatment guidelines will likely reflect a decreased clinical utility for resistance testing.

Hepatitis C virus (HCV) has high genotypic diversity and global distribution. Agents that are effective against all major HCV genotypes, with shorter treatment duration, are needed to reduce disease burden. Glecaprevir (an NS3/4A protease inhibitor) and pibrentasvir (an NS5A inhibitor) have a high barrier to resistance and synergistic antiviral activity. We evaluated the safety and efficacy of 8 and 12 weeks' treatment with glecaprevir/pibrentasvir in patients with HCV genotype 2, 4, 5, or 6 infection without cirrhosis in 3 separate phase 3 trials. We performed 2 open label, single-arm studies (SURVEYOR-II, Part 4 and ENDURANCE-4) and a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study (ENDURANCE-2). In the ENDURANCE-2 study, adult patients with untreated or previously treated HCV genotype 2 infection without cirrhosis were randomly assigned (2:1) to groups given once-daily oral glecaprevir/pibrentasvir (n = 202; 300 mg/120 mg) or placebo (n = 100) for 12 weeks. In the SURVEYOR-II, Part 4 and ENDURANCE-4 studies, adult patients with untreated or previously treated patients with HCV genotype 2, genotype 4, genotype 5, or genotype 6 infection, without cirrhosis, were given once-daily oral glecaprevir/pibrentasvir (n = 121 in ENDURANCE-4 and n = 145 in SURVEYOR-II) for 12 or 8 weeks, respectively. In all studies the primary endpoint was sustained virologic response at 12 weeks after treatment (SVR12) in the intention-to-treat population. Among patients receiving glecaprevir/pibrentasvir for 8 weeks, rates of SVR12 were 98% (95% CI, 94.1-99.3) in those infected with HCV genotype 2 and 93% (95% CI, 83.6-97.3) in those infected with HCV genotypes 4, 5, or 6. Among patients receiving glecaprevir/pibrentasvir for 12 weeks, rates of SVR12 were 99.5% (95% CI, 98.5-100) in those infected with HCV genotype 2 and 99% (95% CI, 97.6-100) in those infected with HCV genotype 4, 5, or 6. No virologic failures occurred in patients with HCV genotype 4, 5, or 6 infections. The frequency and severity of adverse events in patients receiving glecaprevir/pibrentasvir were similar to those of patients who received placebo. In 3 Phase 3 studies, 8 weeks' treatment with glecaprevir/pibrentasivr produced an SVR12 in at least 93% of patients with chronic HCV genotype 2, 4, 5, or 6 infection without cirrhosis, with virologic failure in less than 1%. The drug combination had a safety profile comparable to 12 week's treatment with glecaprevir/pibrentasvir.

Although direct-acting antiviral (DAA) therapies for chronic hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection have demonstrated high rates of sustained virologic response, virologic failure may still occur, potentially leading to the emergence of viral resistance, which can decrease the effectiveness of subsequent treatment. Treatment options for patients who failed previous DAA-containing regimens, particularly those with nonstructural protein 5A inhibitors, are limited and remain an area of unmet medical need. This phase 2, open-label study (MAGELLAN-1) evaluated the efficacy and safety of glecaprevir (GLE) + pibrentasvir (PIB) ± ribavirin (RBV) in HCV genotype 1-infected patients with prior virologic failure to HCV DAA-containing therapy. A total of 50 patients without cirrhosis were randomized to three arms: 200 mg GLE + 80 mg PIB (arm A), 300 mg GLE + 120 mg PIB with 800 mg once-daily RBV (arm B), or 300 mg GLE + 120 mg PIB without RBV (arm C). By intent-to-treat analysis, sustained virologic response at posttreatment week 12 was achieved in 100% (6/6, 95% confidence interval 61-100), 95% (21/22, 95% confidence interval 78-99), and 86% (19/22, 95% confidence interval 67-95) of patients in arms A, B, and C, respectively. Virologic failure occurred in no patients in arm A and in 1 patient each in arms B and C (two patients were lost to follow-up in arm C). The majority of adverse events were mild in severity; no serious adverse events related to study drug and no relevant laboratory abnormalities in alanine aminotransferase, total bilirubin, or hemoglobin were observed. The combination of GLE and PIB was highly efficacious and well tolerated in patients with HCV genotype 1 infection and prior failure of DAA-containing therapy; RBV coadministration did not improve efficacy.

Glecaprevir and pibrentasvir are direct-acting antiviral agents being developed as combination therapy for the treatment of chronic hepatitis C virus infection. The aim of the present studies was to assess the effect of race and ethnicity (white, Han Chinese, Japanese) on the pharmacokinetics and safety of multiple oral doses of glecaprevir and pibrentasvir given alone and in combination. Two multiple-dose, single-center, phase 1 studies were conducted in healthy adult male and female subjects (n = 170) of respective Asian and white race/ethnicity. Glecaprevir (100, 200, 300, or 700 mg once daily) and pibrentasvir (80, 120, or 160 mg once daily) were administered alone for 7 days followed by the combination of both direct-acting antiviral agents for another 7 days. Intensive blood sampling was performed, and pharmacokinetic parameters were estimated by noncompartmental analyses. ANOVA was employed to evaluate for differences of steady-state glecaprevir and pibrentasvir exposures between Asian (Japanese or Han Chinese) and white subjects. Glecaprevir and pibrentasvir exposures in Han Chinese and Japanese were similar to those in whites across dose levels. The nonlinear dose-exposure relationships for glecaprevir and pibrentasvir were similar across Japanese, Han Chinese, and white subjects, and the safety profiles of the agents were comparable across these groups. The results of these studies demonstrate that race/ethnicity has no clinically meaningful impact on direct-acting antiviral agent exposures, safety, or tolerability of the glecaprevir and pibrentasvir combination. This is supported in part by the large global registration program of the pangenotypic, coformulated fixed-dose glecaprevir/pibrentasvir regimen and allows for inclusion of diverse ethnic populations.
