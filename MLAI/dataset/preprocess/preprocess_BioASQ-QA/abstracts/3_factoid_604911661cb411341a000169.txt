C-type lectin domain family 11 member A (Clec11a), also known as stem cell growth factor (SCGF), C-type lectin superfamily member 3 (CLECSF3), or osteolectin was initially identified as a growth factor for hematopoietic progenitor cells. The human Clec11a gene encodes a polypeptide of 323 amino acids with characteristics of a secreted glycoprotein encompassing two integrin-binding motifs, RGD (Arg-Gly-Asp) and LDT (Leu-Asp-Thr), a putative leucine zipper domain, and a functional C-type lectin domain. It regulates hematopoietic differentiation and homeostasis and exhibits a protective effect against severe malarial anemia and lipotoxicity. Furthermore, Clec11a promotes the differentiation of mesenchymal progenitors into mature osteoblasts in vitro and plays an important role in the maintenance of adult skeleton age-related bone loss and fracture repair. Receptor ligand binding results in activation of downstream signaling cascades including glycogen synthase kinase 3 (GSK3), β-catenin, and Wnt, resulting in the expression of osteoblast-related gene transcripts including Alp, Runx2, Lef1, and Axin2. In addition, Clec11a is also associated with the development of several cancers, including leukemia, multiple myeloma, and gastrointestinal tract tumors. To date, however, the mechanisms governing transcription regulation of the Clec11a gene are not known and remain to be uncovered. Understanding the function and mechanism of action of Clec11a will pave the way for the development of Clec11a as a novel therapeutic target for conditions such as cancer, anemia, and skeletal diseases.

We previously discovered a new osteogenic growth factor that is required to maintain adult skeletal bone mass, Osteolectin/Clec11a. Osteolectin acts on Leptin Receptor<sup>+</sup> (LepR<sup>+</sup>) skeletal stem cells and other osteogenic progenitors in bone marrow to promote their differentiation into osteoblasts. Here we identify a receptor for Osteolectin, integrin α11, which is expressed by LepR<sup>+</sup> cells and osteoblasts. α11β1 integrin binds Osteolectin with nanomolar affinity and is required for the osteogenic response to Osteolectin. Deletion of <i>Itga11</i> (which encodes α11) from mouse and human bone marrow stromal cells impaired osteogenic differentiation and blocked their response to Osteolectin. Like <i>Osteolectin</i> deficient mice, <i>Lepr-cre; Itga11<sup>fl/fl</sup></i> mice appeared grossly normal but exhibited reduced osteogenesis and accelerated bone loss during adulthood. Osteolectin binding to α11β1 promoted Wnt pathway activation, which was necessary for the osteogenic response to Osteolectin. This reveals a new mechanism for maintenance of adult bone mass: Wnt pathway activation by Osteolectin/α11β1 signaling.

Osteogenic suppressors such as Sclerostin not only regulate skeletal development and regeneration but also serve as anti-osteoporosis drug targets. However, very few druggable suppressors have been identified due to limited understanding of the molecular mechanisms governing osteogenesis. Here, we show that fibroblast activation protein (Fap), a serine protease inhibited by the bone growth factor Osteolectin, is an osteogenic suppressor. Genetic deletion of Fap significantly ameliorates limb trabecular bone loss during aging. Pharmacological inhibition of Fap significantly promotes bone formation and inhibits bone resorption in wild-type mice by differentially regulating canonical Wnt and nuclear factor κB (NF-κB) pathways. Pharmacological inhibition of Fap promotes osteoblast differentiation, inhibits osteoclast differentiation, and significantly attenuates osteoporosis in ovariectomized mice. Epistasis analyses in zebrafish show that Osteolectin functions as an endogenous inhibitor of Fap to promote vertebrae mineralization. Taken together, we identify Fap as an important osteogenic suppressor and a potential drug target to treat osteoporosis.
