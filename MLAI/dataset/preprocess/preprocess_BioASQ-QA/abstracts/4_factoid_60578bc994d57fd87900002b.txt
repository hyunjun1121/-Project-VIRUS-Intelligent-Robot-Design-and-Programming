Dietary fructose is primarily metabolized in the liver. Here we demonstrate that, compared with normal hepatocytes, hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) cells markedly reduce the rate of fructose metabolism and the level of reactive oxygen species, as a result of a c-Myc-dependent and heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein (hnRNP) H1- and H2-mediated switch from expression of the high-activity fructokinase (KHK)-C to the low-activity KHK-A isoform. Importantly, KHK-A acts as a protein kinase, phosphorylating and activating phosphoribosyl pyrophosphate synthetase 1 (PRPS1) to promote pentose phosphate pathway-dependent de novo nucleic acid synthesis and HCC formation. Furthermore, c-Myc, hnRNPH1/2 and KHK-A expression levels and PRPS1 Thr225 phosphorylation levels correlate with each other in HCC specimens and are associated with poor prognosis for HCC. These findings reveal a pivotal mechanism underlying the distinct fructose metabolism between HCC cells and normal hepatocytes and highlight the instrumental role of KHK-A protein kinase activity in promoting de novo nucleic acid synthesis and HCC development.

<b>Background:</b> The identification of prognostic markers for non-small-cell lung carcinoma (NSCLC) is needed for clinical practice. The metabolism-reprogramming marker ketohexokinase (KHK)-A and acetyl-CoA synthetase 2 (ACSS2) phosphorylation at S659 (ACSS2 pS659) play important roles in tumorigenesis and tumor development. However, the clinical significance of KHK-A and ACSS2 pS659 in NSCLC is largely unknown. <b>Methods:</b> The expression levels of KHK-A and ACSS2 pS659 were assessed by immunohistochemistry analyses of surgical specimens from 303 NSCLC patients. The prognostic values of KHK-A and ACSS2 pS659 were evaluated by Kaplan-Meier methods and Cox regression models. <b>Results:</b> The expression levels of KHK-A and ACSS2 pS659 were significantly higher in NSCLC tissues than those in adjacent non-tumor tissues (<i>P</i> < 0.0001). KHK-A or ACSS2 pS659 alone and the combination of KHK-A and ACSS2 pS659 were inversely correlated with overall survival in NSCLC patients (<i>P</i> < 0.001). The multivariate analysis indicated that KHK-A or ACSS2 pS659 and KHK-A/ACSS2 pS659 were independent prognostic biomarkers for NSCLC (<i>P</i> = 0.008 for KHK-A, <i>P</i> < 0.001 for ACSS2 pS659, and <i>P</i> < 0.001 for KHK-A/ACSS2 pS659). Furthermore, the combination of KHK-A and ACSS2 pS659 can be used as a prognostic indicator for all stages of NSCLC. <b>Conclusions:</b> KHK-A or ACSS2 pS659 alone and the combination of KHK-A and ACSS2 pS659 can be used as prognostic markers for NSCLC. Our findings highlight the important role of metabolic reprogramming in NSCLC progression.

Fructose is a major component of dietary sugar and its overconsumption exacerbates key pathological features of metabolic syndrome. The central fructose-metabolising enzyme is ketohexokinase (KHK), which exists in two isoforms: KHK-A and KHK-C, generated through mutually exclusive alternative splicing of KHK pre-mRNAs. KHK-C displays superior affinity for fructose compared with KHK-A and is produced primarily in the liver, thus restricting fructose metabolism almost exclusively to this organ. Here we show that myocardial hypoxia actuates fructose metabolism in human and mouse models of pathological cardiac hypertrophy through hypoxia-inducible factor 1α (HIF1α) activation of SF3B1 and SF3B1-mediated splice switching of KHK-A to KHK-C. Heart-specific depletion of SF3B1 or genetic ablation of Khk, but not Khk-A alone, in mice, suppresses pathological stress-induced fructose metabolism, growth and contractile dysfunction, thus defining signalling components and molecular underpinnings of a fructose metabolism regulatory system crucial for pathological growth.

Ketohexokinase (KHK), a primary enzyme in fructose metabolism, has two isoforms, namely, KHK-A and KHK-C. Previously, we reported that renal injury was reduced in streptozotocin-induced diabetic mice which lacked both isoforms. Although both isoforms express in kidney, it has not been elucidated whether each isoform plays distinct roles in the development of diabetic kidney disease (DKD). The aim of the study is to elucidate the role of KHK-A for DKD progression. Diabetes was induced by five consecutive daily intraperitoneal injections of streptozotocin (50 mg/kg) in C57BL/6J wild-type mice, mice lacking KHK-A alone (KHK-A KO), and mice lacking both KHK-A and KHK-C (KHK-A/C KO). At 35 weeks, renal injury, inflammation, hypoxia, and oxidative stress were examined. Metabolomic analysis including polyol pathway, fructose metabolism, glycolysis, TCA (tricarboxylic acid) cycle, and NAD (nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide) metabolism in kidney and urine was done. Diabetic KHK-A KO mice developed severe renal injury compared to diabetic wild-type mice, and this was associated with further increases of intrarenal fructose, dihydroxyacetone phosphate (DHAP), TCA cycle intermediate levels, and severe inflammation. In contrast, renal injury was prevented in diabetic KHK-A/C KO mice compared to both wild-type and KHK-A KO diabetic mice. Further, diabetic KHK-A KO mice contained decreased renal NAD<sup>+</sup> level with the increase of renal hypoxia-inducible factor 1-alpha expression despite having increased renal nicotinamide (NAM) level. These results suggest that KHK-C might play a deleterious role in DKD progression through endogenous fructose metabolism, and that KHK-A plays a unique protective role against the development of DKD.
