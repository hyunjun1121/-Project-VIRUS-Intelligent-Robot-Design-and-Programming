Liposomal vincristine is designed to reduce neurotoxicity and increase dose intensity delivery, and has been approved as salvage therapy in relapsed/refractory acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL). Our aim was to evaluate the response rate, toxicities, and outcome of adults with newly diagnosed ALL who received liposomal vincristine, rather than regular vincristine in combination with intensive chemotherapy (Hyper-CMAD). In a single-center, phase 2 study, patients ≥18 years with newly-diagnosed B-cell ALL were eligible to receive hyper-CMAD alternating with high-dose methotrexate and cytarabine. Rituximab was administered in CD20 positive ALL. Tyrosine kinase inhibitors (imatinib or dasatinib) were added in Philadelphia chromosome-positive (Ph-positive) ALL. Thirty-one patients were enrolled, median follow-up of 59 months (0.3-70). Thirteen patients (42%) had CD20 positive ALL, and 21 (68%) had Ph-positive ALL. Thirty (97%) achieved complete remission (CR). All 26 patients with abnormal karyotype achieved complete cytogenetic response (CCyR), and 27/30 (90%) achieved negative minimal residual disease status by multicolor flow cytometry. Of 20 evaluable Ph-positive ALL patients, major molecular response (MMR) was achieved in 19 patients (95%); complete molecular response (CMR) in 14 (70%). Grade 3/4 peripheral neuropathy was observed in five (16%) with all grade peripheral neuropathy in 21 (68%). With a median follow-up of 59 months, 21 (68%) patients are alive. The 5-year CR duration and survival rates were 73% and 61%, respectively. Ten (32%) patients died: one, sepsis on C1D10; four, unknown; one, post-transplant complications; four, relapse. Hyper-CMAD with liposomal vincristine is safe and demonstrated high response and survival rates in newly diagnosed ALL.

Improving survival outcomes in adult B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (B-ALL) remains a clinical challenge. Relapsed disease has a poor prognosis despite the use of tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) for Philadelphia chromosome positive (Ph+ ALL) cases and immunotherapeutic approaches, including blinatumomab and chimeric antigen receptor T cells. Targeting aberrant cell survival pathways with selective small molecule BH3-mimetic inhibitors of BCL-2 (venetoclax, S55746), BCL-XL (A1331852), or MCL1 (S63845) is an emerging therapeutic option. We report that combined targeting of BCL-2 and MCL1 is synergistic in B-ALL in vitro. The combination demonstrated greater efficacy than standard chemotherapeutics and TKIs in primary samples from adult B-ALL with Ph+ ALL, Ph-like ALL, and other B-ALL. Moreover, combined BCL-2 or MCL1 inhibition with dasatinib showed potent killing in primary Ph+ B-ALL cases, but the BH3-mimetic combination appeared superior in vitro in a variety of Ph-like ALL samples. In PDX models, combined BCL-2 and MCL1 targeting eradicated ALL from Ph- and Ph+ B-ALL cases, although fatal tumor lysis was observed in some instances of high tumor burden. We conclude that a dual BH3-mimetic approach is highly effective in diverse models of high-risk human B-ALL and warrants assessment in clinical trials that incorporate tumor lysis precautions.

Outcomes in patients with Philadelphia chromosome (Ph)-positive acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) have improved with the use of tyrosine kinase inhibitors. Molecular remission is a primary goal of treatment. We conducted a phase 2 single-group trial of first-line therapy in adults with newly diagnosed Ph-positive ALL (with no upper age limit). Dasatinib plus glucocorticoids were administered, followed by two cycles of blinatumomab. The primary end point was a sustained molecular response in the bone marrow after this treatment. Of the 63 patients (median age, 54 years; range, 24 to 82) who were enrolled, a complete remission was observed in 98%. At the end of dasatinib induction therapy (day 85), 29% of the patients had a molecular response, and this percentage increased to 60% after two cycles of blinatumomab; the percentage of patients with a molecular response increased further after additional blinatumomab cycles. At a median follow-up of 18 months, overall survival was 95% and disease-free survival was 88%; disease-free survival was lower among patients who had an <i>IKZF1</i> deletion plus additional genetic aberrations (<i>CDKN2A</i> or <i>CDKN2B</i>, <i>PAX5</i>, or both [i.e., <i>IKZF1</i> <sup>plus</sup>]). <i>ABL1</i> mutations were detected in 6 patients who had increased minimal residual disease during induction therapy, and all these mutations were cleared by blinatumomab. Six relapses occurred. Overall, 21 adverse events of grade 3 or higher were recorded. A total of 24 patients received a stem-cell allograft, and 1 death was related to transplantation (4%). A chemotherapy-free induction and consolidation first-line treatment with dasatinib and blinatumomab that was based on a targeted and immunotherapeutic strategy was associated with high incidences of molecular response and survival and few toxic effects of grade 3 or higher in adults with Ph-positive ALL.

The BCR-ABL inhibitor imatinib revolutionized the treatment of chronic myeloid leukemia (CML). However, resistance and intolerance to imatinib have emerged as substantial clinical issues. The mechanisms underlying resistance are multifactorial and may include mutations in the kinase domain of BCR-ABL, increased production of BCR-ABL, or activation of BCR-ABL-independent pathways. Two second-line BCR-ABL inhibitors are now approved for treatment of patients with resistance or intolerance to imatinib. Dasatinib is a dual BCR-ABL/Src-family kinase (SFK) inhibitor approved for patients with imatinib-resistant and -intolerant CML in any phase and Ph+ ALL. Nilotinib, an analogue of imatinib, is approved for the treatment of imatinib-resistant or -intolerant patients with chronic or accelerated phase CML. Both agents have shown significant clinical activity in patients with imatinib-resistant or -intolerant CML, and their approval represents a major advancement in the treatment options available. Choosing the most appropriate treatment after imatinib failure may be critical in attaining the best possible long-term prognosis. The presence of certain disease characteristics (e.g. specific BCR-ABL mutations) or patient comorbidities may facilitate more effective treatment. In this review, we discuss mechanisms of imatinib resistance and preclinical and clinical data with dasatinib and nilotinib which may have potential use for guiding second-line treatment decisions.

A phase II trial shows that a chemotherapy-free regimen of dasatinib and blinatumomab produces molecular responses in patients with Philadelphia chromosome-positive acute lymphoblastic leukemia. The study found that 60% of patients had molecular responses after two cycles of blinatumomab and 71% had molecular responses after five cycles.
