In embryonic chicken liver (ECL) two types of iodothyronine deiodinases are expressed: D1 and D3. D1 catalyzes the activation as well as the inactivation of thyroid hormone by outer and inner ring deiodination, respectively. D3 only catalyzes inner ring deiodination. D1 and D3 have been cloned from mammals and amphibians and shown to contain a selenocysteine (Sec) residue. We characterized chicken D1 and D3 complementary DNAs (cDNAs) and studied the expression of hepatic D1 and D3 messenger RNAs (mRNAs) during embryonic development. Oligonucleotides based on two amino acid sequences strongly conserved in the different deiodinases (NFGSCTSecP and YIEEAH) were used for reverse transcription-PCR of poly(A+) RNA isolated from embryonic day 17 (E17) chicken liver, resulting in the amplification of two 117-bp DNA fragments. Screening of an E17 chicken liver cDNA library with these probes led to the isolation of two cDNA clones, ECL1711 and ECL1715. The ECL1711 clone was 1360 bp long and lacked a translation start site. Sequence alignment showed that it shared highest sequence identity with D1s from other vertebrates and that the coding sequence probably lacked the first five nucleotides. An ATG start codon was engineered by site-directed mutagenesis, generating a mutant (ECL1711M) with four additional codons (coding for MGTR). The open reading frame of ECL1711M coded for a 249-amino acid protein showing 58-62% identity with mammalian D1s. An in-frame TGA codon was located at position 127, which is translated as Sec in the presence ofa Sec insertion sequence (SECIS) identified in the 3'-untranslated region. Enzyme activity expressed in COS-1 cells by transfection with ECL1711M showed the same catalytic, substrate, and inhibitor specificities as native chicken D1. The ECL1715 clone was 1366 bp long and also lacked a translation start site. Sequence alignment showed that it was most homologous with D3 from other species and that the coding sequence lacked approximately the first 46 nucleotides. The deduced amino acid sequence showed 62-72% identity with the D3 sequences from other species, including a putative Sec residue at a corresponding position. The 3'-untranslated region of ECL1715 also contained a SECIS element. These results indicate that ECL1711 and ECL1715 are near-full-length cDNA clones for chicken D1 and D3 selenoproteins, respectively. The ontogeny of D1 and D3 expression in chicken liver was studied between E14 and 1 day after hatching (C1). D1 activity showed a gradual increase from E14 until C1, whereas D1 mRNA level remained relatively constant. D3 activity and mRNA level were highly significantly correlated, showing an increase from E14 to E17 and a strong decrease thereafter. These results suggest that the regulation of chicken hepatic D3 expression during embryonic development occurs predominantly at the pretranslational level.

Production of T3 from T4 in tissues is catalyzed by two 5'-deiodinases, type I (D1) and type II (D2), but the quantitative contribution of each pathway to whole body T3 production is not well established. In the presence of propylthiouracil (PTU), D1, but not D2, can be effectively blocked, providing an experimental probe for addressing this problem. Decades ago, this approach provided indirect estimates ranging from 23-44% contribution by D2, based on plasma T3 appearance rate comparisons (PAR3 = PCR3 [T3]p) in periodically T4-injected athyreotic rats vs. controls. Two, more recent studies, using constant infusions of T4 for replacement, achieved 22% and 65% estimates, respectively, from PAR3 comparisons. We have revisited this problem more directly and precisely, with two major differences in experiment design. We used direct whole body steady state measurements of T3 production, instead of indirect plasma-only data (PAR3). We also used (euthyroid) physiological doses of both T4 (0.9 microg/day x 100 g BW) and T3 (0.15 microg/day x 100 g BW) for replacement in two thyroidectomized rat groups, instead of T4 only, in a 7-day constant steady state, dual tracer infusion protocol. The first group also had chronically implanted 150-mg PTU pellets (TXR-PTU); the other had implanted 0.1 N NaOH placebo pellets (TXR-EU); each delivered their product at constant rates. A third euthyroid intact group was used as the controls. The completeness of D1 inhibition was ascertained in a fourth group, identically treated with 150-mg PTU pellets, in which negligible D1 activity was found in liver and kidney using labeled rT3 as substrate for the 5'-D assays and minimal (1 mM) dithiothreitol as cofactor. In the TXR-PTU group, the percentage of T4 converted to T3 was 11.8%, compared with 23.4% (P < 0.0005) in the TXR-EU group, and 22.7% (P = NS) in controls. Thus, in euthyroid steady state, D2 contributes about half of the T3 produced from T4.

The uptake and metabolism of T3 and rT3 was studied in human liver-derived HepG2 cells. The results showed a saturable, time-dependent, and ouabain-sensitive increase in nuclear bound T3. The effects of ouabain (0.5 mmol/L) and unlabeled T3 (10 nmol/L and 10 mumol/L) were much more pronounced at the nuclear level, suggesting the presence of a nonspecific component in total cellular binding. Nuclear binding of rT3 remained below the detection limit in all experiments. Comparison of rT3 metabolism in HepG2 cells and primary cultures of rat hepatocytes showed an approximately 10-fold lower iodide production in HepG2 cells. Iodide production was decreased in the presence of ouabain and almost absent in the presence of propylthiouracil (100 mumol/L). Our data confirmed the presence of a carrier-mediated uptake system for both T3 and rT3. Metabolism data indicated functional type I deiodinase activity in HepG2 cells, the presence of glucuronidating enzymes, and the absence of thyroid hormone sulfotransferase activity. Based on these data, we propose that HepG2 cells provide an appropriate model for thyroid hormone handling by human liver. In addition, we suggest that in human liver sulfation of thyroid hormone, and therefore deiodination of T3 is of only minor importance.

The role of the deiodinases D1, D2, and D3 in the tissue-specific and time-dependent regulation of thyroid hormone bioactivity during fetal development has been investigated in animals but little is known about the ontogeny of these enzymes in humans. We analyzed D1, D2, and D3 activities in liver microsomes from 10 fetuses of 15-20 weeks gestation and from 8 apparently healthy adult tissue transplant donors, and in liver homogenates from 2 fetuses (20 weeks gestation), 5 preterm infants (27-32 weeks gestation), and 13 term infants who survived up to 39 weeks postnatally. D1 activity was determined using 1 microM [3',5'-125I]rT3 as substrate and 10 mM dithiothreitol (DTT) as cofactor, D2 activity using 1 nM [3',5'-125I]T4 and 25 mM DTT in the presence of 1 mM 6-propyl-2-thiouracil (to block D1 activity) and 1 microM T3 (to block D3 activity), and D3 activity using 10 nM [3,5-125I]T3 and 50 mM DTT, by quantitation of the release of 125I. The assays were validated by high performance liquid chromatography of the products, and kinetic analysis [Michaelis-Menten constant (Km) of rT3 for D1: 0.5 microM; Km of T3 for D3: 2 nM]. In liver homogenates, D1 activity was not correlated with age, whereas D3 activity showed a strong negative correlation with age (r -0.84), with high D3 activities in preterm infants and (except in 1 infant of 35 weeks) absent D3 activity in full-term infants. In microsomes, D1 activities amounted to 4.3-60 pmol/min/mg protein in fetal livers and to 170-313 pmol/min/mg protein in adult livers, whereas microsomal D3 activities were 0.15-1.45 pmol/min/mg protein in fetuses and <0.1 pmol/min/mg protein in all but one adult. In the latter sample, D3 activity amounted to 0.36 pmol/min/mg protein. D2 activity was negligible in both fetal and adult livers. These findings indicate high D1 and D3 activities in fetal human liver, and high D1 and mostly absent D3 activities in adult human liver. Therefore, the low serum T3 levels in the human fetus appear to be caused by high hepatic (and placental) D3 activity rather than caused by low hepatic D1 activity. The occasional expression of D3 in adult human liver is intriguing and deserves further investigation.

In systemic nonthyroidal illness (NTI), peripheral production of T3 from T4 is decreased, resulting in a decreased serum T3 concentration. We investigated whether factors in serum of NTI patients may play a role in this energy-saving adaptation mechanism. Metabolism of T4 and T3 by rat hepatocytes in primary culture was measured in the presence of 10% serum of normal subjects or of patients with NTI and related to the severity of disease. Patients with NTI were grouped according to serum thyroid hormone abnormalities: group I, serum rT3, T3, and T4 normal; group III, rT3 elevated, T3 decreased, T4 normal; group IV, rT3 elevated, T3 and T4 decreased. Compared with metabolism in the presence of normal serum, metabolism of T4 and to a lesser extent of T3 was progressively decreased in the presence of serum of patients of groups I-IV. A decreased net deiodination of T4 and T3 (corrected for differences in free hormone concentration) without an increase in conjugated T4 and T3 (corrected for differences in free hormone concentration) was observed, similar to results in experiments with compounds inhibiting transport into the cells and not the metabolic processes (5' deiodination) per se. Deiodination of T4 in vitro was correlated with serum T3 concentration of the patient (r = 0.69). Serum of patients with NTI influences thyroid hormone handling by hepatocytes comparable to the effect of transport inhibitors and not to that of the 5'-deiodinase inhibitor propylthiouracil, suggesting that decreased thyroid hormone transport over the cell membrane may play a role in lowered T3 production in NTI.

Iodothyronine deiodinase in vitro activity studies in the chicken showed the presence of type I and type III iodothyronine deiodinase activity in both liver and kidney. Due to the lack of a specific antiserum the cellular localization of the deiodinase proteins could not be revealed until now. In the present study, specific antisera were used to study the renal and hepatic distribution of type I and type III iodothyronine deiodinase protein in the chicken. Immunocytochemical staining of liver tissue led to an immunopositive signal in the hepatocytes in general. Moreover, a zonal distribution could be detected for both enzymes. Maximum protein expression was shown in a thin layer of hepatocytes bordering the blood veins. Although pericentral localization of type I deiodinase protein has been previously reported in the rat, no data were given concerning type III deiodinase protein. In the present study, we report the co-localization of both enzymes in the chicken. Co-expression of the deiodinases was also found in the kidney. Expression of both proteins was associated with the tubular epithelial cells and with the transitional epithelium, and the inner longitudinal and outer circular muscle layers of the ureter. No staining could be detected in the lamina propria or in the fat tissue surrounding the ureter.
