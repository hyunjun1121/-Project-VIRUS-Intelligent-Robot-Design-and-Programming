The incidence of migraine is higher among women than men and peaks during the reproductive years, when contraceptive medication use is common. Atogepant, a potent, selective antagonist of the calcitonin gene-related peptide receptor-in development for migraine prevention-is thus likely to be used by women taking oral contraceptives. This phase 1, open-label, single-center, 2-period, fixed-sequence study examined the effect of multiple-dose atogepant 60 mg once daily on the single-dose pharmacokinetics of a combination oral contraceptive, ethinyl estradiol 0.03 mg and levonorgestrel 0.15 mg (EE/LNG), in healthy postmenopausal or oophorectomized women. For participants in period 1, a single dose of EE/LNG was followed by a 7-day washout. In period 2, atogepant was given once daily on days 1-17; an oral dose of EE/LNG was coadministered with atogepant on day 14. Plasma pharmacokinetic parameters for EE and LNG were assessed following administration with and without atogepant. Twenty-six participants aged 45-64 years enrolled; 22 completed the study in accordance with the protocol. The area under the concentration-time curve extrapolated to infinity (AUC<sub>0-∞</sub> ) of LNG was increased by 19% when administered with atogepant. Coadministration of atogepant and a single dose of EE/LNG did not substantially alter the pharmacokinetics of EE; the ∼19% increase in plasma AUC<sub>0-∞</sub> of LNG is not anticipated to be clinically significant. Overall, atogepant alone and in combination with EE/LNG was generally well tolerated, with no new safety signals identified.

Atogepant is a potent, selective, oral calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP) receptor antagonist in development for migraine prevention. The chemical structure of atogepant is distinct from previous CGRP receptor antagonists, which were associated with elevated serum alanine aminotransferase (ALT) in clinical trials. Here, we report the safety, tolerability, and pharmacokinetics (PKs) of a once-daily supratherapeutic dose (170 mg) of atogepant for 28 days from a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled phase I trial in healthy participants. Overall safety, hepatic safety, and plasma PK parameters were evaluated. Thirty-four participants aged 23-55 years enrolled; 28 (82.4%) completed the study in accordance with the protocol. Multiple doses of 170 mg atogepant for 28 consecutive days were generally well-tolerated. All adverse events (AEs; reported in 87.0% of the atogepant group; 72.7%, placebo) were mild in severity except one serious AE of subarachnoid hemorrhage due to a bicycle accident and not considered related to treatment. There were two discontinuations due to AEs, both with atogepant, one considered possibly related to treatment. Over 28 days of treatment, no participant receiving atogepant had an ALT elevation above 1.5 × upper limit of normal. Change from baseline in serum ALT levels was not different between atogepant and placebo. Atogepant is rapidly absorbed (median time to maximum plasma concentration, ~ 2 hours) with an apparent terminal half-life of ~ 11 hours, and no evidence of accumulation after once-daily dosing. Overall, atogepant at a high oral dose is safe and well-tolerated in healthy participants with no clinically meaningful elevations in ALT.

Atogepant is an oral, small-molecule, calcitonin gene-related peptide receptor antagonist for the preventive treatment of migraine. In the double-blind, phase 3 ADVANCE trial, participants with 4-14 migraine days/month were randomized to atogepant 10 mg, 30 mg, 60 mg, or placebo once daily for 12 weeks. We evaluated the time course of efficacy of atogepant for the preventive treatment of migraine. Analyses included change from baseline in mean monthly migraine days during each of the three 4-week treatment periods, change in weekly migraine days during weeks 1-4, and proportion of participants with a migraine on each day during the first week. We analyzed 873 participants (n = 214 atogepant 10 mg, n = 223 atogepant 30 mg, n = 222 atogepant 60 mg, n = 214 placebo). For weeks 1-4, mean change from baseline in mean monthly migraine days ranged from -3.1 to -3.9 across atogepant doses vs -1.6 for placebo (<i>p</i> < 0.0001). For weeks 5-8 and 9-12, reductions in mean monthly migraine days ranged from -3.7 to -4.2 for atogepant vs -2.9 for placebo (<i>p</i> ≤ 0.012) and -4.2 to -4.4 for atogepant vs -3.0 for placebo (<i>p</i> < 0.0002), respectively. Mean change from baseline in weekly migraine days in week 1 ranged from -0.77 to -1.03 for atogepant vs -0.29 with placebo (<i>p</i> < 0.0001). Percentages of participants reporting a migraine on post-dose day 1 ranged from 10.8% to 14.1% for atogepant vs 25.2% with placebo (<i>p</i> ≤ 0.0071). Atogepant demonstrated treatment benefits as early as the first full day after treatment initiation, and sustained efficacy across each 4-week interval during the 12-week treatment period.<b>Clinical trial registration:</b> ClinicalTrials.gov identifier: NCT03777059.

Atogepant is an oral, small-molecule, calcitonin gene-related peptide receptor antagonist that is being investigated for the preventive treatment of migraine. In a phase 3, double-blind trial, we randomly assigned adults with 4 to 14 migraine days per month in a 1:1:1:1 ratio to receive a once-daily dose of oral atogepant (10 mg, 30 mg, or 60 mg) or placebo for 12 weeks. The primary end point was the change from baseline in the mean number of migraine days per month across the 12 weeks. Secondary end points included headache days per month, a reduction from baseline of at least 50% in the 3-month average of migraine days per month, quality of life, and scores on the Activity Impairment in Migraine-Diary (AIM-D). A total of 2270 participants were screened, 910 were enrolled, and 873 were included in the efficacy analysis; 214 were assigned to the 10-mg atogepant group, 223 to the 30-mg atogepant group, 222 to the 60-mg atogepant group, and 214 to the placebo group. The mean number of migraine days per month at baseline ranged from 7.5 to 7.9 in the four groups. The changes from baseline across 12 weeks were -3.7 days with 10-mg atogepant, -3.9 days with 30-mg atogepant, -4.2 days with 60-mg atogepant, and -2.5 days with placebo. The mean differences from placebo in the change from baseline were -1.2 days with 10-mg atogepant (95% confidence interval [CI], -1.8 to -0.6), -1.4 days with 30-mg atogepant (95% CI, -1.9 to -0.8), and -1.7 days with 60-mg atogepant (95% CI, -2.3 to -1.2) (P<0.001 for all comparisons with placebo). Results for the secondary end points favored atogepant over placebo with the exceptions of the AIM-D Performance of Daily Activities score and the AIM-D Physical Impairment score for the 10-mg dose. The most common adverse events were constipation (6.9 to 7.7% across atogepant doses) and nausea (4.4 to 6.1% across atogepant doses). Serious adverse events included one case each of asthma and optic neuritis in the 10-mg atogepant group. Oral atogepant once daily was effective in reducing the number of migraine days and headache days over a period of 12 weeks. Adverse events included constipation and nausea. Longer and larger trials are needed to determine the effect and safety of atogepant for migraine prevention. (Funded by Allergan; ADVANCE ClinicalTrials.gov number, NCT03777059.).

<b>Introduction</b>: Migraine is one of the most common neurological disorders. Nowadays, the 5-HT<sub>1B/1D</sub> receptor agonists, namely triptans, are considered as the standard of care for migraine acute treatment. However, triptans have limitations in some patients, such as incomplete pain relief, headache recurrence, and cardiovascular contraindications. New 5-HT<sub>1F</sub> receptor agonists, namely ditans, and calcitonin gene-related peptide receptor antagonists, namely gepants, have been developed as migraine-specific treatments.<b>Areas covered</b>: This paper reviews the available data from RCTs to assess the clinical efficacy, safety, and tolerability profile of lasmiditan, rimegepant, and ubrogepant for the acute treatment of migraine and atogepant for the prevention of migraine.<b>Expert opinion</b>: Available data suggest that lasmiditan, rimegepant, and ubrogepant might not have a clinical efficacy similar to triptans. Lasmiditan did not cause the typical triptan side effects but was associated with central nervous system side effects, causing temporary driving impairment. On the contrary, the new generation of gepants showed a placebo-like tolerability profile and the absence of a specific pattern of side effects. Future studies on lasmiditan and gepants with respect to established effective comparators are mandatory to support phase III results and to help clinicians to balance the benefit/risk profiles of the various acute and preventive medications.
