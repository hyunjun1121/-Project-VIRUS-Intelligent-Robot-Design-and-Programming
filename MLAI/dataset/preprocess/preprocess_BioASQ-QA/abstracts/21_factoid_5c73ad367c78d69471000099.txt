Treatment with doxorubicin is a present standard of care for patients with metastatic soft-tissue sarcoma and median overall survival for those treated is 12-16 months, but few, if any, novel treatments or chemotherapy combinations have been able to improve these poor outcomes. Olaratumab is a human antiplatelet-derived growth factor receptor α monoclonal antibody that has antitumour activity in human sarcoma xenografts. We aimed to assess the efficacy of olaratumab plus doxorubicin in patients with advanced or metastatic soft-tissue sarcoma. We did an open-label phase 1b and randomised phase 2 study of doxorubicin plus olaratumab treatment in patients with unresectable or metastatic soft-tissue sarcoma at 16 clinical sites in the USA. For both the phase 1b and phase 2 parts of the study, eligible patients were aged 18 years or older and had a histologically confirmed diagnosis of locally advanced or metastatic soft-tissue sarcoma not previously treated with an anthracycline, an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status of 0-2, and available tumour tissue to determine PDGFRα expression by immunohistochemistry. In the phase 2 part of the study, patients were randomly assigned in a 1:1 ratio to receive either olaratumab (15 mg/kg) intravenously on day 1 and day 8 plus doxorubicin (75 mg/m(2)) or doxorubicin alone (75 mg/m(2)) on day 1 of each 21-day cycle for up to eight cycles. Randomisation was dynamic and used the minimisation randomisation technique. The phase 1b primary endpoint was safety and the phase 2 primary endpoint was progression-free survival using a two-sided α level of 0.2 and statistical power of 0.8. This study was registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT01185964. 15 patients were enrolled and treated with olaratumab plus doxorubicin in the phase 1b study, and 133 patients were randomised (66 to olaratumab plus doxorubicin; 67 to doxorubicin alone) in the phase 2 trial, 129 (97%) of whom received at least one dose of study treatment (64 received olaratumab plus doxorubicin, 65 received doxorubicin). Median progression-free survival in phase 2 was 6.6 months (95% CI 4.1-8.3) with olaratumab plus doxorubicin and 4.1 months (2.8-5.4) with doxorubicin (stratified hazard ratio [HR] 0.67; 0.44-1.02, p=0.0615). Median overall survival was 26.5 months (20.9-31.7) with olaratumab plus doxorubicin and 14.7 months (9.2-17.1) with doxorubicin (stratified HR 0.46, 0.30-0.71, p=0.0003). The objective response rate was 18.2% (9.8-29.6) with olaratumab plus doxorubicin and 11.9% (5.3-22.2) with doxorubicin (p=0.3421). Steady state olaratumab serum concentrations were reached during cycle 3 with mean maximum and trough concentrations ranging from 419 μg/mL (geometric coefficient of variation in percentage [CV%] 26.2) to 487 μg/mL (CV% 33.0) and from 123 μg/mL (CV% 31.2) to 156 μg/mL (CV% 38.0), respectively. Adverse events that were more frequent with olaratumab plus doxorubicin versus doxorubicin alone included neutropenia (37 [58%] vs 23 [35%]), mucositis (34 [53%] vs 23 [35%]), nausea (47 [73%] vs 34 [52%]), vomiting (29 [45%] vs 12 [18%]), and diarrhoea (22 [34%] vs 15 [23%]). Febrile neutropenia of grade 3 or higher was similar in both groups (olaratumab plus doxorubicin: eight [13%] of 64 patients vs doxorubicin: nine [14%] of 65 patients). This study of olaratumab with doxorubicin in patients with advanced soft-tissue sarcoma met its predefined primary endpoint for progression-free survival and achieved a highly significant improvement of 11.8 months in median overall survival, suggesting a potential shift in the treatment of soft-tissue sarcoma.

To review and summarize data on olaratumab, which was approved by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in October 2016, in combination with doxorubicin, for the treatment of advanced soft tissue sarcoma. A literature search using PubMed was conducted using the search terms olaratumab, IMC-3G3, and advanced soft tissue sarcoma from January 2005 to June 2017. The literature search was confined to human studies published in English. Trials of olaratumab for advanced soft tissue sarcomas were prioritized. Olaratumab is a human antiplatelet-derived growth factor receptor α monoclonal antibody. Its accelerated FDA approval was based on a phase II randomized trial of olaratumab plus doxorubicin (n = 66) versus doxorubicin monotherapy (n = 67) in patients with advanced soft tissue sarcoma. Olaratumab 15 mg/kg was administered intravenously (IV) on days 1 and 8 in combination with doxorubicin 75 mg/m<sup>2</sup> IV on day 1 every 21 days for a total of 8 cycles compared to doxorubicin 75 mg/m<sup>2</sup> IV monotherapy. The response rate was 18.2% with combination therapy versus 11.9% with monotherapy and median progression-free survival of 6.6 and 4.1 months, respectively. Additionally, overall survival was increased by 11.8 months in the olaratumab arm (26.5 months vs 14.7 months). Clinically relevant adverse effects in the olaratumab + doxorubicin arm included neutropenia (58%), mucositis (53%), nausea (73%), vomiting (45%), and diarrhea (34%). Olaratumab, in combination with doxorubicin, represents a novel treatment strategy for advanced soft tissue sarcoma and provides a significant survival advantage for this rare disease state with limited treatment options.

<b>Purpose:</b> Platelet-derived growth factor receptor α (PDGFRα) is implicated in several adult and pediatric malignancies, where activated signaling in tumor cells and/or cells within the microenvironment drive tumorigenesis and disease progression. Olaratumab (LY3012207/IMC-3G3) is a human mAb that exclusively binds to PDGFRα and recently received accelerated FDA approval and conditional EMA approval for treatment of advanced adult sarcoma patients in combination with doxorubicin. In this study, we investigated olaratumab in preclinical models of pediatric bone and soft tissue tumors.<b>Experimental Design:</b> PDGFRα expression was evaluated by qPCR and Western blot analysis. Olaratumab was investigated in <i>in vitro</i> cell proliferation and invasion assays using pediatric osteosarcoma and rhabdoid tumor cell lines. <i>In vivo</i> activity of olaratumab was assessed in preclinical mouse models of pediatric osteosarcoma and malignant rhabdoid tumor.<b>Results:</b><i>In vitro</i> olaratumab treatment of osteosarcoma and rhabdoid tumor cell lines reduced proliferation and inhibited invasion driven by individual platelet-derived growth factors (PDGFs) or serum. Furthermore, olaratumab delayed primary tumor growth in mouse models of pediatric osteosarcoma and malignant rhabdoid tumor, and this activity was enhanced by combination with either doxorubicin or cisplatin.<b>Conclusions:</b> Overall, these data indicate that olaratumab, alone and in combination with standard of care, blocks the growth of some preclinical PDGFRα-expressing pediatric bone and soft tissue tumor models. <i>Clin Cancer Res; 24(4); 847-57. ©2017 AACR</i>.

Lartruvo<sup>®</sup> (olaratumab) is a fully human immunoglobulin G subclass 1 (IgG1) monoclonal antibody that inhibits platelet-derived growth factor receptor alpha (PDGFRα). The antitumor activity of olaratumab has been tested in vitro and in vivo, and inhibition of tumor growth has been observed in cancer cell lines, including glioblastoma and leiomyosarcoma cells. It represents the first-in-class antibody to be approved by regulatory authorities for the treatment of advanced soft-tissue sarcomas (STSs) in combination with doxorubicin, based on the results of the Phase Ib/II trial by Tap et al. The median progression-free survival (PFS), which was the primary end point of the study, was improved for patients treated with olaratumab plus doxorubicin compared to those treated with doxorubicin monotherapy (6.6 vs 4.1 months, respectively; HR 0.672, 95% CI 0.442-1.021, <i>p</i>=0.0615). Moreover, final analysis of overall survival (OS) showed a median OS of 26.5 months with olaratumab plus doxorubicin vs 14.7 months with doxorubicin, with a gain of 11.8 months (HR 0.46, 95% CI 0.30-0.71, <i>p</i>=0.0003). In October 2016, olaratumab was admitted in the Accelerated Approval Program by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for use in combination with doxorubicin for the treatment of adult patients with STSs. In November 2016, the European Medicines Agency (EMA) granted conditional approval for olaratumab in the same indication under its Accelerated Assessment Program. A double-blind, placebo-controlled, randomized Phase III study (ANNOUNCE trial, NCT02451943) is being performed in order to confirm the survival advantage of olaratumab and to provide definitive drug confirmation by regulators. The study is ongoing, but enrollment is closed. The purpose of this review was to evaluate the rationale of olaratumab in the treatment of advanced STSs and its emerging role in clinical practice.

Recent randomised phase II trial data have indicated that the addition of olaratumab, a novel monoclonal antibody against platelet-derived growth factor receptor alpha (PDGFRα), to doxorubicin confers an unprecedented improvement in overall survival to patients with anthracycline-naïve advanced soft tissue sarcoma. However, this result was disproportionate with progression-free survival and response rate, and consequently there are unanswered questions regarding the precise mechanism of action of olaratumab. While preclinical data show that olaratumab specifically inhibits PDGFRα-mediated oncogenic signalling with attendant anti-tumour effects, a lack of correlation between pharmacodynamics markers of PDGFRα inhibition and clinical benefit from olaratumab suggest other mechanisms beyond modulation of downstream PDGFRα molecular pathways. Proposed mechanisms of olaratumab activity include engagement of anti-tumour immune responses and alterations of the tumour stroma, but these require further evaluation. Meanwhile, the drug-specific contribution of cytotoxic agents to olaratumab-containing combinations has yet to be characterised. Ongoing and future preclinical and translational studies, coupled with the anticipated results of a phase III trial that has completed enrolment, should provide greater insight into the efficacy and mode of action of olaratumab in soft tissue sarcomas.

Olaratumab (IMC-3G3) is a fully human IgG1 monoclonal antibody that selectively binds the external domain of human platelet-derived growth factor receptor-α with high affinity and blocks ligand binding. This was a single-center, dose-escalation, phase I trial of olaratumab in Japanese patients with advanced/refractory solid malignancies. Three to six patients were enrolled into each of three cohorts: Patients received i.v. olaratumab: 10 mg/kg on days 1 and 8 every 3 weeks (cohort 1); 20 mg/kg every 2 weeks (cohort 2); and 15 mg/kg on days 1 and 8 every 3 weeks (cohort 3). Doses were escalated from cohort 1 through cohort 3. The primary objective was to establish the safety and pharmacokinetic profile of olaratumab. Sixteen patients were treated across three cohorts. There were no dose-limiting toxicities, so the maximum tolerated dose was not reached. The most common olaratumab-related treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAEs) were proteinuria (25.0%) and elevated aspartate transaminase (12.5%). One patient (cohort 2) had two olaratumab-related Grade 3 TEAEs (increased aspartate aminotransferase and tumor hemorrhage); otherwise, olaratumab-related TEAEs were Grade 1/2. Seven patients (43.8%) had a best response of stable disease. Based on the pharmacokinetic concentration profile of olaratumab, the trough concentrations following single and multiple doses at 15 mg/kg on days 1 and 8 every 3 weeks (cohort 3) and multiple doses at 20 mg/kg every 2 weeks (cohort 2) were above the 155 μg/mL target. Thus, these two doses could represent an acceptable schedule for future trials in Japanese patients. Olaratumab had an acceptable safety profile and was well tolerated.

Olaratumab is a recombinant human monoclonal antibody that binds to platelet-derived growth factor receptor-α (PDGFRα). In a randomized phase II study, olaratumab plus doxorubicin met its predefined primary endpoint for progression-free survival and achieved a highly significant improvement in overall survival versus doxorubicin alone in patients with advanced or metastatic soft tissue sarcoma (STS). In this study, we characterize the pharmacokinetics (PKs) of olaratumab in a cancer patient population. Olaratumab was tested at 15 or 20 mg/kg in four phase II studies (in patients with nonsmall cell lung cancer, glioblastoma multiforme, STS, and gastrointestinal stromal tumors) as a single agent or in combination with chemotherapy. PK sampling was performed to measure olaratumab serum levels. PK data were analyzed by nonlinear mixed-effect modeling techniques using NONMEM<sup>®</sup>. The PKs of olaratumab were best described by a two-compartment PK model with linear clearance (CL). Patient body weight was found to have a significant effect on both CL and central volume of distribution (V <sub>1</sub>), whereas tumor size significantly affected CL. A small subset of patients developed treatment-emergent anti-drug antibodies (TE-ADAs); however, TE-ADAs did not have any effect on CL or PK time course of olaratumab. There was no difference in the PKs of olaratumab between patients who received olaratumab as a single agent or in combination with chemotherapy. The PKs of olaratumab were best described by a model with linear disposition. Patient body weight and tumor size were found to be significant covariates. The PKs of olaratumab were not affected by immunogenicity or chemotherapeutic agents.

Olaratumab, a monoclonal antibody targeting human platelet-derived growth factor receptor α, plus doxorubicin significantly improved overall survival in patients with advanced soft-tissue sarcoma (STS) in a prior phase 1b/2 randomized trial. Subsequent exposure-response analysis suggested that higher olaratumab exposures earlier might improve outcomes in patients at risk of early disease progression. This phase 1 study (3 treatment cohorts; minimum 6 patients each) investigated the safety, pharmacokinetics and antitumor activity of olaratumab plus doxorubicin in Japanese patients with STS. Patients received olaratumab 15 mg/kg on Days 1 and 8 during each 21-day cycle until disease progression. Patients in Cohort 3 received a 20 mg/kg loading dose of olaratumab in Cycle 1. Doxorubicin was administered for up to 6 cycles. Patients in Cohort 1 received doxorubicin 25 mg/m<sup>2</sup> on Days 1, 2 and 3. Patients in Cohorts 2 and 3 received doxorubicin 75 mg/m<sup>2</sup> on Day 1. One patient in Cohort 2 experienced a dose-limiting toxicity of Grade 3 febrile neutropenia. Most treatment-emergent adverse events were of mild and moderate severity, and were known doxorubicin toxicities. Olaratumab serum concentrations in Cohort 3 reached a steady-state exceeding the target level in Cycle 1. Partial response was confirmed in 4 patients (2 each in Cohorts 2 and 3). Olaratumab plus doxorubicin had an acceptable safety profile in patients with STS. A loading dose of olaratumab 20 mg/kg was effective for achieving minimum serum concentrations above the target trough level in Cycle 1.

Advanced soft tissue sarcomas are aggressive cancers with limited therapeutic options. Recently, inhibition of platelet-derived growth factor receptor (PDGFR)-α by the monoclonal antibody olaratumab showed promising clinical activity. If confirmed, this would be one of the first examples of targeted therapy effective in advanced soft tissue sarcomas therapy independently of the histologic subtype. Here, we reviewed the biology of the PDGF/PDGFR axis, particularly focusing on its role in cancer, and then we discussed on the effects of PDGFR-α inhibition in the therapy of advanced soft tissue sarcomas.

Soft-tissue sarcomas (STS) are a heterogeneous group of diseases that are characterized by a historic lack of active treatment options. However, several new drugs and indications have become available in recent years. This article reviews the most relevant phase II studies that utilize chemotherapy agents (aldoxorubicin, amrubicin, trabectedin alone or in combination with doxorubicin, and gemcitabine plus docetaxel), targeted therapies (Imatinib, dasatinib, regorafenib, tivozanib, palbociclib and selinexor), a combination of chemotherapy plus targeted therapies (fucusing on doxorubicin plus olaratumab) and immunotherapies (pembrolizumab, combination of nivolumab plus ipilimumab and adaptive cell therapy) in STS (other than gastrointestinal stromal tumors) (GIST) published from 2015. Some of these strategies are under further clinical development or will likely be assessed in future phase III studies. A series of novel treatments have shown encouraging results in STS in recent years. The most important is the combination of the standard cytotoxic agent doxorubicin plus the platelet-derived growth factor receptor (PDGFR) inhibitor olaratumab, although definitive results from a phase III trial are expected. Immunotherapy has not been as successful in STS so far. However, further investigations are ongoing.

In non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), platelet-derived growth factor receptor (PDGFR) mediates angiogenesis, tissue invasion, and tumor interstitial pressure. Olaratumab (IMC-3G3) is a fully human anti-PDGFRα monoclonal antibody. This Phase II study assessed safety and efficacy of olaratumab+paclitaxel/carboplatin (P/C) versus P/C alone for previously untreated advanced NSCLC. Patients received up to six 21-day cycles of P 200mg/m<sup>2</sup> and C AUC 6 (day 1)±olaratumab 15mg/kg (days 1 and 8). Primary endpoint was PFS. Olaratumab was continued in the olaratumab+P/C arm until disease progression. 131 patients were: 67 with olaratumab+P/C and 64 with P/C; 74% had nonsquamous NSCLC. Median PFS was similar between olaratumab+P/C and P/C (4.4 months each) (HR 1.29; 95% CI [0.86-1.93]; p=0.21). Median OS was similar between olaratumab+P/C (11.8 months) and P/C (11.5 months) (HR 1.04; 95% CI [0.68-1.57]; p=0.87). Both arms had similar toxicity profiles. All evaluable cases were PDGFR-negative by immunohistochemistry. Tumor stroma PDGFR expression was evaluable in 23/131 patients, of which 78% were positive. The addition of olaratumab to P/C did not result in significant prolongation of PFS or OS in advanced NSCLC. Olaratumab studies in other patient populations, including soft tissue sarcoma (NCT02783599), pancreatic cancer (NCT03086369), and pediatric malignancies (NCT02677116) are underway.

Olaratumab (Lartruvo™) is a fully human IgG1 monoclonal antibody targeted against the human platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF) receptor α (PDGFRα). It was developed by Eli Lilly and Co. (previously ImClone Systems) after PDGFRα was identified as a potential therapeutic target in a variety of cancers. Olaratumab acts by selectively binding PDGFRα, thereby blocking PDGF ligand binding and inhibiting PDGFRα activation and downstream signalling. In October 2016, olaratumab received its first global approval, in the USA, for use in combination with doxorubicin for the treatment of adult patients with soft tissue sarcoma. The approval was granted by the US FDA under its Accelerated Approval Program based on the results of the JGDG phase II trial (NCT01185964). In addition, the EMA granted conditional approval for olaratumab in this indication in November 2016 following a review under the EMA's Accelerated Assessment Program. An international, confirmatory phase III trial in patients with soft tissue sarcoma is ongoing (ANNOUNCE; NCT02451943). Olaratumab has also been investigated in phase II trials in several other cancers. This article summarizes the milestones in the development of olaratumab leading to this first approval, for use in combination with doxorubicin for the treatment of soft tissue sarcoma in adults.

The outcome for patients with unresectable/metastatic soft tissue sarcoma remains poor with few treatment options. In the first line setting, a number of randomized trials have shown no difference in overall survival between combination anthracycline schedules and single agent doxorubicin. A Phase Ib/randomized Phase II trial of doxorubicin with or without the monoclonal antibody to PDGFR-α, olaratumab, demonstrated a significant difference in median overall survival in favor of the olaratumab arm. The results of this trial led to approval of olaratumab in combination with doxorubicin in adult anthracycline-naive unresectable soft tissue sarcoma. In this review, we describe some of the preclinical and early clinical data of olaratumab in sarcomas, the Phase Ib/II trial and ongoing trials with olaratumab in sarcomas.

Olaratumab is a humanized IgG1 monoclonal antibody that blocks the platelet-derived growth factor receptor alpha (PDGFRα). Its antagonistic behavior inhibits the receptor's tyrosine kinase activity, thereby, turning off the downstream signaling cascades responsible for soft tissue sarcoma tumorigenesis. In October 2016, olaratumab received Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approval for its use in combination with doxorubicin for treatment of advanced soft tissue sarcoma. Areas covered: This drug profile takes a comprehensive look at the clinical studies leading to FDA approval of olaratumab as well as its safety and efficacy as a front-line treatment option for sarcoma patients. The literature search was primarily conducted using PubMed. Expert commentary: The combination of olaratumab plus doxorubicin has provided a new front-line therapeutic option for soft tissue sarcoma patients. An open-label phase Ib and randomized phase II trial in patients with advanced soft tissue sarcoma demonstrated that the addition of olaratumab to doxorubicin prolonged progression-free survival by 2.5 months and overall survival by 11.8 months when compared to doxorubicin alone. Of importance, this clinically meaningful increase in overall survival did not come at the expense of a significantly greater number of toxicities. A phase III confirmatory trial (ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier NCT02451943) will be completed in 2020.

Soft tissue sarcomas (STS) are rare malignant tumors. Unfortunately, the first-line doxorubicin-based treatment has not been improved since the 1970s. Platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF) receptor alpha (PDGFR-α) and its ligands are co-expressed in many types of cancer, including sarcomas. They are involved in stimulating growth and regulating stromal-derived fibroblasts and angiogenesis. PDGFR-α and its ligand may play an important role in tumorigenesis and be a potential target in the treatment of sarcomas. Olaratumab is a fully human IgG1-type anti-PDGFR-α monoclonal antibody with a high affinity and a low 50% inhibitory concentration (IC50). Areas covered: The authors review the role of olaratumab in the treatment of STS by focusing on the recent, randomized Phase II JDGD trial that challenged patients with unresectable or metastatic STS with doxorubicin in the presence or absence of olaratumab. This trial showed a great improvement in overall survival (OS), with an increase in survival from 14.7 months to 26.5 months for patients in the experimental arm and showed acceptable toxicity. Expert opinion: Results seem promising. However, it must be qualified, as the study includes several uncertainties. These uncertainties should be addressed by the ongoing Phase 3 JGDJ confirmatory trial, for which the final efficacy analysis is expected by 2019.

Olaratumab is a recombinant human IgG1 monoclonal antibody against PGDFRα. Olaratumab plus doxorubicin improved survivalversus doxorubicin in an open-label, randomised phase 2 soft tissue sarcoma (STS) trial. We characterised the olaratumab exposure-response relationship for progression-free survival (PFS), overall survival (OS), and safety. PFS and OS data from the 133 patients enrolled in the phase 2 study were analysed using time-to-event modelling. The effect of olaratumab on PFS/OS was explored using the trough serum concentration after cycle 1 (C<sub>min1</sub>) and the average concentration throughout treatment (C<sub>avg</sub>). The rate of treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAEs) was compared across olaratumab exposure quartiles. PFS and OS were described by models with an exponential hazard function and inhibitory E<sub>MAX</sub> functions to describe the effect of olaratumab, regardless of the PK endpoint. The olaratumab EC50s for PFS (EC<sub>min1</sub>50 = 82.0 µg/mL, EC<sub>avg</sub>50 = 179 µg/mL) and OS (EC<sub>min1</sub>50 = 66.1 µg/mL, EC<sub>avg</sub>50 = 134 µg/mL) corresponded to the median and 25th percentile of C<sub>min1</sub>/C<sub>avg</sub> in the study, respectively. Maximum predicted improvement in the hazard ratio for OS and PFS was approximately 75% and 60%, respectively. There was no change in the rate of TEAEs with increasing olaratumab serum levels. PFS/OS benefits occurred without a rate change in TEAEs across quartiles. Maximum benefit in OS was achieved in the upper three quartiles and a potential of early disease progression in the lower quartile of olaratumab serum exposure. These results prompted a loading dose strategy in the ongoing phase 3 STS trial.

Soft-tissue sarcoma (STS) is a heterogeneous group of tumors that arise from mesenchymal tissue. The prognosis of metastatic STS is poor with a life expectancy of 12-18 months. The mainstay of treatment is chemotherapy with an anthracycline. The addition of other chemotherapeutic agents to an anthracycline has been studied with limited success in improving outcomes for STS patients. Olaratumab is a fully human IgG1 monoclonal antibody that binds to platelet-derived growth factor receptor α (PDGFR-α) preventing binding of its ligands and receptor activation. This drug recently received the US Food and Drug Administration's accelerated approval for the treatment of advanced STS when combined with doxorubicin. This approval was based upon an improvement in overall survival of patients receiving the combination of doxorubicin and olaratumab compared to those receiving doxo-rubicin alone. In this review, we have analyzed the available literature on the development of olaratumab, its clinical utility, and its place in therapy. Based on early-phase clinical trials, olaratumab appears to be a promising agent for the treatment of STS.

The platelet-derived growth factor receptor (PDGFR) has an important role in tumorigenesis and tumor progression. Olaratumab (IMC-3G3) is a fully human monoclonal antibody that selectively binds human PDGFRα and blocks ligand binding. This phase I study assessed the safety, maximum tolerated dose (MTD), recommended phase II dose (RP2D), pharmacokinetics, and preliminary antitumor activity of olaratumab in patients with advanced solid tumors. Patients were enrolled into five dose-escalating cohorts of 3-6 patients each. Olaratumab was administered intravenously weekly at 4, 8, or 16 mg/kg (cohorts 1-3) or once every other week at 15 or 20 mg/kg (cohorts 4-5), with 4 weeks/cycle. Nineteen patients were treated in five cohorts. There were no dose-limiting toxicities; the MTD was not identified with the doses studied. The most common olaratumab-related adverse events (AE) were fatigue and infusion reactions (10.5 % each). With the exception of 1 patient (20 mg/kg) experiencing two grade 3 drug-related AEs after the dose-limiting toxicity assessment period, all drug-related AEs were grade 1 or 2. The trough concentrations (C min) for 16 mg/kg weekly and 20 mg/kg biweekly were higher than 155 μg/mL, and the concentration found to be efficacious in preclinical xenograft models. Twelve patients (63.2 %) had a best response of stable disease [median duration of 3.9 months (95 % CI 2.3-8.7)]. Olaratumab was well tolerated and showed preliminary antitumor activity. RP2Ds are 16 mg/kg weekly and 20 mg/kg biweekly. Phase II studies of olaratumab as monotherapy and in combination are ongoing in several tumor types.

Lartruvo (olaratumab) is a monoclonal antibody against the extracellular domain of PDGFRA. Olaratumab blocks ligand binding and thereby inhibits activation of PDGFRA kinase activity. Pre-clinically, this antibody inhibited PDGFRA-dependent tumor growth. In a randomized Phase II study, adding olaratumab to doxorubicin chemotherapy significantly improved overall survival, leading to FDA approval.

Platelet-derived growth factor receptor α (PDGFRα), a tyrosine kinase receptor, is up-regulated in hepatic stellate cells (HSCs) during chronic liver injury. HSCs mediate hepatic fibrosis through their activation from a quiescent state partially in response to profibrotic growth factors. HSC activation entails enhanced expression of profibrotic genes, increase in proliferation, and increase in motility, which facilitates migration within the hepatic lobule. We show colocalization of PDGFRα in murine carbon tetrachloride, bile duct ligation, and 0.1% 3,5-diethoxycarbonyl-1,4-dihydrocollidine models of chronic liver injury, and investigate the role of PDGFRα on proliferation, profibrotic gene expression, and migration in primary human HSCs (HHSteCs) using the PDGFRα-specific inhibitory monoclonal antibody olaratumab. Although lacking any effects on HHSteC transdifferentiation assessed by gene expression of ACTA2, TGFB1, COL1A1, SYP1, and FN1, olaratumab specifically reduced HHSteC proliferation (AlamarBlue assay) and cell migration (transwell migration assays). Using phospho-specific antibodies, we show that olaratumab attenuates PDGFRα activation in response to PDGF-BB, and reduced phosphorylation of extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1 and 2, Elk-1, p38, Akt, focal adhesion kinase, mechanistic target of rapamycin, C10 regulator of kinase II, and C10 regulator of kinase-like, suggesting that PDGFRα contributes to mitogenesis and actin reorganization through diverse downstream effectors. Our findings support a distinct contribution of PDGFRα signaling to HSC proliferation and migration and provide evidence that inhibition of PDGFRα signaling could alter the pathogenesis of hepatic fibrosis.
