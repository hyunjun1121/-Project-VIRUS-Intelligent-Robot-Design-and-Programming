Ischaemic stroke and coronary heart disease are important contributors to the global disease burden and share atherosclerosis as the main underlying cause. Recent evidence from a genome-wide association study (GWAS) suggested that single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNP) near the MMP12 gene at chromosome 11q22.3 were associated with large-vessel ischaemic stroke. Here, we evaluated and extended these results by examining the relationship between MMP12 and atherosclerosis in clinical and experimental studies. Plasma concentrations of MMP12 were measured at baseline in 3394 subjects with high-risk for cardiovascular disease (CVD) using the Olink ProSeek CVD I array. The plasma MMP12 concentration showed association with incident cardiovascular and cerebrovascular events (130 and 67 events, respectively, over 36 months) and carotid intima-media thickness progression (P = 3.6 × 10<sup>-5</sup> ). A GWAS of plasma MMP12 concentrations revealed that SNPs rs499459, rs613084 and rs1892971 at chr11q22.3 were independently associated with plasma MMP12 (P < 5 × 10<sup>-8</sup> ). The lead SNPs showed associations with mRNA levels of MMP12 and adjacent MMPs in atherosclerotic plaques. MMP12 transcriptomic and proteomic levels were strongly significantly increased in carotid plaques compared with control arterial tissue and in plaques from symptomatic versus asymptomatic patients. By combining immunohistochemistry and proximity ligation assay, we demonstrated that MMP12 localizes to CD68 + macrophages and interacts with elastin in plaques. MMP12 silencing in human THP-1-derived macrophages resulted in reduced macrophage migration. Our study supports the notion that MMP12 is implicated in large-artery atherosclerotic stroke, functionally by enhancing elastin degradation and macrophage invasion in plaques.

Animal models suggest that chemokines are important mediators in the pathophysiology of neuropathic pain. Indeed, these substances have been called "gliotransmitters," a term that illustrates the close interplay between glial cells and neurons in the context of neuroinflammation and pain. However, evidence in humans is scarce. The aim of the study was to determine a comprehensive cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) inflammatory profile of patients with neuropathic pain. Our hypothesis was that we would thereby find indications of a postulated on-going process of central neuroinflammation. Samples of CSF were collected from 2 cohorts of patients with neuropathic pain (n = 11 and n = 16, respectively) and healthy control subjects (n = 11). The samples were analyzed with a multiplex proximity extension assay in which 92 inflammation-related proteins were measured simultaneously (Proseek Multiplex Inflammation I; Olink Bioscience, Uppsala, Sweden). Univariate testing with control of false discovery rate, as well as orthogonal partial least squares discriminant analysis, were used for statistical analyses. Levels of chemokines CXCL6, CXCL10, CCL8, CCL11, CCL23 in CSF, as well as protein LAPTGF-beta-1, were significantly higher in both neuropathic pain cohorts compared with healthy controls, pointing to neuroinflammation in patients. These 6 proteins were also major results in a recent similar study in patients with fibromyalgia. The findings need to be confirmed in larger cohorts, and the question of causality remains to be settled. Because it has been suggested that prevalent comorbidities to chronic pain (eg, depression, anxiety, poor sleep, and tiredness) also are associated with neuroinflammation, it will be important to determine whether neuroinflammation is a common mediator.

Several genes are expressed in aspirated coronary thrombi in acute myocardial infarction (AMI), exhibiting dynamic changes along ischemic time. Whether soluble biomarkers reflect the local gene environment and ischemic time is unclear. We explored whether circulating biomarkers were associated with corresponding coronary thrombi genes and total ischemic time. In 33 AMI patients undergoing percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI), blood samples were collected within 6-24h for markers related to plaque rupture (metalloproteinase 9, tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinases 1), platelet and endothelial cell activation (P-selectin, CD40 ligand, PAR-1), hemostasis (tissue factor, tissue plasminogen activator, plasminogen activator inhibitor 1, free and total tissue factor pathway inhibitor, D-dimer, prothrombin fragment 1+2), inflammation (interleukin 8 and 18, fractalkine, monocyte chemoattractant protein 1 (MCP-1), CXCL1, pentraxin 3, myeloperoxidase) and galectin 3, caspase 8 and epidermal growth factor (EGF). Laboratory analyses were performed by Proximity Extension Assay (Proseek Multiplex CVD I(96 × 96)), ELISAs and RT-PCR. Only circulating P-selectin correlated to the corresponding P-selectin gene expression in thrombi (r=0.530, p=0.002). Plasma galectin 3, fractalkine, MCP-1 and caspase 8 correlated inversely to ischemic time (r=-0.38-0.50, all p <0.05), while plasma MCP-1, galectin 3 and EGF were higher at short (≤ 4 h) vs. long (>4h) ischemic time (all p <0.05). The dynamic changes in circulating mediators along ischemic time were not reflected in the profile of locally expressed genes. These observations indicate a locally confined milieu within the site of atherothrombosis, which may be important for selective therapy.

There is extensive evidence for an influence of gut microbiota on the immune system, which has consequences for inflammatory diseases. Exclusive enteral nutrition (EEN), which may change the gut microbiota, is an effective anti-inflammatory treatment for Crohn's disease in children. We wanted to explore the immediate anti-inflammatory effect of EEN in children with juvenile idiopathic arthritis (JIA). Thirteen patients with JIA (7-17 years of age), in a disease flare-up, were included in the study. Six children dropped out within 1.5-2.0 weeks of treatment, and seven patients continued, constituting the study cohort. EEN was given for three to eight weeks, with clinical and laboratory status assessed before and after treatment periods. In addition to conventional laboratory tests, 92 inflammatory proteins were analysed with a multiplex system (Proseek Multiplex Inflammation I, Olink Bioscience). EEN had a significant anti-inflammatory effect on active joints (p=0.031), JADAS27 (p=0.016) and morning stiffness (p=0.031). In the multiplex analysis of inflammatory proteins, MMP-1 (matrix metalloproteinase), involved in the degradation of collagens in chondrocytes, decreased significantly (p=0.047), as did MCP-4 (p=0.031) and 4E-BP1 (p=0.031). Exclusive enteral nutrition for three to eight weeks had anti-inflammatory effect in all children with JIA that continued with EEN for more than two weeks. The study is only exploratory but the result supports an immunologically important role for the intestinal canal in these patients.

Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) is a remarkably heterogeneous autoimmune disease. Despite tremendous efforts, our knowledge of serum protein patterns in severe SLE phenotypes is still limited. We investigated the serum protein pattern of SLE, with special emphasis on irreversible organ damage and active lupus nephritis (LN) as assessed by renal Systemic Lupus Erythematosus Disease Activity Index. We used proximity extension immunoassay (PEA, Proseek Multiplex, Olink) to assess the serum levels of ninety-two inflammation-related proteins in Czech patients with SLE (n = 75) and age-matched healthy control subjects (n = 23). Subgroup analysis was carried out on the basis of organ damage (with/without, 42/33) and biopsy-proven LN (with/without, 27/48; active LN, n = 13; inactive LN, n = 14). Of thirty deregulated proteins between SLE and the healthy controls (<i>P</i><sub><i>corr</i></sub>  < 0.05), the top upregulated proteins in SLE were sirtuin 2, interleukin 18 (IL18), and caspase 8 (<i>P</i><sub><i>corr</i></sub>  < 0.0006). Of these, sirtuin 2 and caspase 8 had not yet been reported with SLE. Elevated levels of IL8, CCL2/MCP1, CCL11, and MMP10 (<i>P</i><sub><i>corr</i></sub>  < 0.05) were detected in patients with organ damage for which the serum levels of CCL11 and MMP10 were particularly informative in organ damage prediction. Comparing patients based on LN, elevated levels of CSF1, sIL15RA, sCD40, sCX3CL1, caspase 8, sIL18R1, bNGF, and GDNF (<i>P</i><sub><i>corr</i></sub>  < 0.05) were detected in active LN. Except GDNF, all LN-associated markers showed usefulness in prediction of active renal disease. This highly sensitive PEA analysis identified the serum pattern of SLE, organ damage, and active LN, with many novel candidate proteins detected. Their exact role and suitability as biomarkers in SLE deserve further investigation.

Allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (aHSCT) is used as a curative treatment in severe hematological and immunological disorders. Despite clear improvement of the aHSCT outcome, substantial proportion of patients still suffers from severe complications, including graft-versus-host disease (GvHD). The aim of this study was, therefore, to identify inflammation-associated molecules deregulated in the early serum samples of the patients after aHSCT and nominate markers associated with particular aHSCT parameters/complications. Serum concentrations of 92 inflammation-associated proteins were measured in samples obtained from 80 aHSCT patients 14 days after transplantation and from 23 healthy control subjects by a novel sensitive proximity extension assay technology using Proseek Multiplex Inflammation I kit. Serum profiles of inflammatory proteins in patients after aHSCT were substantially different from those observed in control subjects and related to underlying disease status before transplantation. Particularly, the difference between aHSCT patients and controls reached significance level for 57 analytes (40 upregulated, 17 downregulated in aHSCT patients). The concentration of several markers was associated with the level of donor/recipient HLA match (TGF-α: p <sub>corr</sub> = 0.025, HGF: p <sub>corr</sub> = 0.036) and with complete donor chimerism at day +30 after allografting (DNER: p <sub>corr</sub> = 0.042). None of the markers was significantly associated with acute and chronic GvHD after correction. More than half of investigated proteins significantly differed between the samples from aHSCT patients and healthy control subjects as a consequence of the "cytokine storm" after aHSCT. Comparisons of patient's subgroups based on specific biological/clinical parameters revealed much less evident differences; nevertheless, we nominated several markers associated with the level of donor/recipient HLA match and post-transplant chimerism.

Serum protein fingerprints associated with MGUS and MM and their changes in MM after autologous stem cell transplantation (MM-ASCT, day 100) remain unexplored. Using highly-sensitive Proximity Extension ImmunoAssay on 92 cancer biomarkers (Proseek Multiplex, Olink), enhanced serum levels of Adrenomedullin (ADM, <i>P</i><sub>corr</sub>= .0004), Growth differentiation factor 15 (GDF15, <i>P</i><sub>corr</sub>= .003), and soluble Major histocompatibility complex class I-related chain A (sMICA, <i>P</i><sub>corr</sub>= .023), all prosurvival and chemoprotective factors for myeloma cells, were detected in MM comparing to MGUS. Comparison of MGUS and healthy subjects revealed elevation of angiogenic and antia-poptotic midkine (<i>P</i><sub>corr</sub>= .0007) and downregulation of Transforming growth factor beta 1 (TGFB1, <i>P</i><sub>corr</sub>= .005) in MGUS. Importantly, altered serum pattern was associated with MM-ASCT compared to paired MM at the diagnosis as well as to healthy controls, namely by upregulated B-Cell Activating Factor (sBAFF) (<i>P</i><sub>corr</sub>< .006) and sustained elevation of other pro-tumorigenic factors. In conclusion, the serum fingerprints of MM and MM-ASCT were characteristic by elevated levels of prosurvival and chemoprotective factors for myeloma cells.

This study evaluates the effect of food intake on 92 neurological biomarkers in plasma. Moreover, it investigated if any of the biomarkers were correlated with body mass index. Twenty-two healthy subjects (11 male and 11 female aged 25.9 ± 4.2 years) were investigated. A total of 92 biomarkers were measured before a standardized meal as well as 30 and 120 min afterward with the Proseek Multiplex Neurology I kit. The levels for 13 biomarkers decreased significantly (<i>p</i> < .001) 30 min after food intake. The levels for four biomarkers remained significantly decreased (<i>p</i> < .001) 120 min after food intake. One biomarker increased significantly (<i>p</i> < .001) 30 min after food intake. The changes were between 1% and 12%, with an average difference of about 5%. Only one biomarker showed a difference over 10% due to food intake. The biggest difference was observed for Plexin-B3 120 min after food intake (12%). Of all the 92 neurological biomarkers, only one was correlated with BMI, Kynureninase <i>r</i> = .46, <i>p</i> < .05. This study shows that food intake has a very modest effect on 92 different neurological biomarkers. Timing of blood sampling in relation to food intake, therefore, appears not to be a major concern. Only Kynureninase was correlated with BMI. Further studies are warranted in older healthy subjects and in patients with various neurological diseases to determine whether the findings are reproducible in such populations.

The present study evaluates the effect of food intake on 92 biomarkers for cardiovascular disease (CVD). Twenty two healthy subjects (11 male and 11 female aged 25.9±4.2 years) were investigated. A total of 92 biomarkers were measured before a standardized meal as well as 30 and 120 minutes afterwards with the Proseek Multiplex CVD III kit. The levels for eight biomarkers decreased significantly (P<0.05) 30 minutes after food intake. The levels for seven biomarkers remained significantly decreased 120 minutes after food intake. Nine biomarker decreased significantly at 120 minutes after food intake. The changes were between 4-30%, most commonly around 5%. Only six biomarkers showed a difference of 10% or more due to food intake. The biggest differences were observed for Insulin-like growth factor-binding protein 1 (30%); Azurocidin, Cystatin-B, and Myeloperoxidase (13%); Monocyte chemotactic protein 1 (11%); and Myeloblastin (10%), all 120 minutes after food intake. This study shows that food intake affects several different CVD biomarkers, but the effect is predominantly modest. Timing of blood sampling in relation to food intake, therefore, appears not to be a major concern. Further studies are warranted in older healthy subjects and in patients with various cardiac diseases to determine whether the findings are reproducible.

We used a proteomics array to simultaneously measure multiple proteins that have been suggested to be associated with atherosclerosis and related them to plaque prevalence in carotid arteries in a human population-based study. In the Prospective Study of the Vasculature in Uppsala Seniors (PIVUS; n = 931, 50% women, all aged 70 years), the number of carotid arteries with plaques was recorded by ultrasound. Levels of 82 proteins were assessed in plasma by a proximity extension assay (Proseek Multiplex CVD, Olink Bioscience, Uppsala, Sweden) and related to carotid measures in a regression framework. Following adjustment for multiple testing with Bonferroni correction, seven of the proteins were significantly related to the number of carotid arteries affected by plaques in sex-adjusted models (osteoprotegrin, T-cell immunoglobulin and mucin domain (TIM)-1, growth/differentiation factor 15 (GDF-15), matrix metalloprotease-12 (MMP-12), renin, tumor necrosis factor ligand superfamily member 14 (TNFSF14) and growth hormone). Of these, renin (odds ratio [OR], 1.30; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.13-1.49 per standard deviation increase), growth hormone (OR, 1.24; 95% CI, 1.08-1.43), osteoprotegerin (OR, 1.22; 95% CI, 1.05-1.43) and TNFSF14 (OR, 1.17; 95% CI, 1.01-1.35) were related to plaque prevalence independently of each other and traditional cardiovascular risk factors. A novel targeted proteomics approach using the proximity extension technique discovered several new associations of candidate proteins with carotid artery plaque prevalence in a large human sample.

Currently, there are no FDA approved screening tools for detecting early stage ovarian cancer in the general population. Development of a biomarker-based assay for early detection would significantly improve the survival of ovarian cancer patients. We used a multiplex approach to identify protein biomarkers for detecting early stage ovarian cancer. This new technology (Proseek<sup>®</sup> Multiplex Oncology Plates) can simultaneously measure the expression of 92 proteins in serum based on a proximity extension assay. We analyzed serum samples from 81 women representing healthy, benign pathology, early, and advanced stage serous ovarian cancer patients. Principle component analysis and unsupervised hierarchical clustering separated patients into cancer versus non-cancer subgroups. Data from the Proseek<sup>®</sup> plate for CA125 levels exhibited a strong correlation with current clinical assays for CA125 (correlation coefficient of 0.89, 95% CI 0.83, 0.93). CA125 and HE4 were present at very low levels in healthy controls and benign cases, while higher levels were found in early stage cases, with highest levels found in the advanced stage cases. Overall, significant trends were observed for 38 of the 92 proteins (p < 0.001), many of which are novel candidate serum biomarkers for ovarian cancer. The area under the ROC curve (AUC) for CA125 was 0.98 and the AUC for HE4 was 0.85 when comparing early stage ovarian cancer versus healthy controls. In total, 23 proteins had an estimated AUC of 0.7 or greater. Using a naïve Bayes classifier that combined 12 proteins, we improved the sensitivity corresponding to 95% specificity from 93 to 95% when compared to CA125 alone. Although small, a 2% increase would have a significant effect on the number of women correctly identified when screening a large population. These data demonstrate that the Proseek<sup>®</sup> technology can replicate the results established by conventional clinical assays for known biomarkers, identify new candidate biomarkers, and improve the sensitivity and specificity of CA125 alone. Additional studies using a larger cohort of patients will allow for validation of these biomarkers and lead to the development of a screening tool for detecting early stage ovarian cancer in the general population.

Cardiovascular and inflammatory biomarkers in therapeutic hypothermia have been studied in cardiac arrest, but data on patients with ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) treated with therapeutic hypothermia are currently unavailable. A multiplex proximity extension assay allowed us to measure 157 cardiovascular disease (CVD) and inflammatory disease-related biomarkers in patients from the international, multicenter, and randomized trial; CHILL-myocardial infarction (MI) and to explore the associations of cardiovascular and inflammatory biomarkers. Blood samples were obtained from 119 patients with STEMI, randomized to hypothermia as adjunctive therapy to percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) or standard care with PCI only. Blood samples were obtained at baseline (0 hour), 6, 24, and 96 hours post PCI, and stored at -80°C until they were analyzed by PROSEEK Multiplex CVD and PROSEEK Multiplex INF (Olink Bioscience, Uppsala, Sweden). Peak values from 6, 24, and 96 hours postrandomization were compared between treatment groups. One hundred fifty-seven cardiovascular and inflammatory biomarkers were evaluated. Peak values of four biomarkers (BDNF, DNER, CCL20, MMP3) were reduced in the hypothermia group as compared with the control group. In addition, seven markers were slightly elevated in the hypothermia group (OPG, FGF21, FS, IL12B, PRL, TIM, IL6). In a prespecified subgroup analysis of anterior infarctions, two additional markers were reduced (PTX3 and SELE). In this explorative proteomic study from the randomized trial CHILL-MI, four biomarkers were identified as having reduced peak plasma values in patients with STEMI treated with therapeutic hypothermia as adjunctive therapy to PCI as compared with patients treated with standard care of PCI. In addition, seven biomarkers were elevated in the group treated with hypothermia therapy. The effect of hypothermia on biomarker peak values was modest, possibly due to a low reduction in mean body temperature. Whether a faster and deeper cooling results in more pronounced effects is yet to be established.
