Non-small cell lung carcinomas (NSCLC) overexpress the Her2/neu gene in approximately 59% of cases. Trastuzumab, a humanized monoclonal antibody, interferes with Her2 signaling and is approved for the treatment of Her2/neu overexpressing breast cancer. However, its therapeutic use in Her2/neu overexpressing NSCLC remains obscure. The present study aimed to determine the role of (64)Cu-labeled trastuzumab positron emission tomography (PET) for non-invasive imaging of Her2/neu expression in NSCLC. Trastuzumab was conjugated with the bifunctional chelator 1, 4, 7, 10-tetraazacyclododecane-1, 4, 7, 10-tetraacetic acid (DOTA) and radiolabeled with (64)Cu. The molecular specificity of DOTA-trastuzumab was determined in NSCLC cell lines with Her2/neu overexpression (NCI-H2170) and negative expression (NCI-H520). Imaging of Her2/neu expression was performed in NCI-H2170 tumor-bearing mice with (64)Cu-DOTA-trastuzumab PET and (64)Cu-DOTA-IgG. In vitro studies revealed specific binding of DOTA-trastuzumab in the Her2/neu positive NCI-H2170 cells, while no binding was seen in the Her2/neu negative NCI-H520 cell line. Biodistribution and PET studies revealed a significantly high accumulation of (64)Cu-DOTA-trastuzumab in the Her2/neu overexpressing NCI-H2170 tumor at 24 and 48 h post-injection (21.4 +/- 1.4% and 23.2 +/- 5.1% injection dose/gram (% ID/g), respectively). PET imaging of Her2/neu negative NCI-H520 tumors showed much less uptake of (64)Cu-DOTA-trastuzumab (4.0% ID/g). The NCI-H2170 tumor uptake of (64)Cu-DOTA-trastuzumab was significantly higher than that of (64)Cu-DOTA-IgG (P < 0.0001). (64)Cu-DOTA-trastuzumab showed a very clear image of a Her2/neu positive tumor and appeared to be effective as a PET tracer for imaging of Her2/neu gene expression in NSCLC, suggesting its potential clinical use for identifying patients that might benefit from trastuzumab-based therapy.

The antitumor effect of CGP41251 (4'-N-benzoyl staurosporine), a selective protein kinase C (PKC) inhibitor, was examined on two kinds of human non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) cell lines (adenocarcinoma: A549 and squamous cell carcinoma: NCI-H520). CGP41251 at 0.5 or 1.0 microM inhibited the proliferation of these tumor cell lines significantly; However, at 0.1 microM, it did not show any significant inhibition. Cell cycle analysis indicated that CGP41251 at 0.5 or 1.0 microM arrested the cell cycle progression at the G2/M phase up to 24 hr, but 0.1 microM did not. It seems that the antiproliferative action of CGP41251 against human NSCLC is related to G2/M accumulation. In NCI-H520, CGP41251 caused DNA re-replication without mitosis. In a nude mice xenograft, CGP41251 at a dose of 200 mg/kg showed antitumor activity against these cell lines. Histopathologically, expansion of central necrosis was observed, although no destruction of tumor nests was seen by CGP41251 administration. In both tumor tissues, the PKC activity of the particulate fraction was significantly decreased by CGP41251 treatment. From these results, it is thought that the antitumor activity of CGP41251 against human NSCLS is accompanied by the decrease of PKC activity in the particulate fraction. Moreover, the G2/M arrest of the cell cycle induced by CGP41251 might be important for the growth inhibitory action of this compound.

Multidrug resistance (MDR) is a main reason for paclitaxel (TAX) treatment failure. Indirubin-3'-monoxime (IRO) and Matrine are traditional Chinese medicines, which may reverse the resistance of tumor cells to some chemotherapy drugs, but the relationship between paclitaxel resistance and Matrine is still unclear. The aim of this study was to explore the potential molecular mechanism of IRO and Matrine in reversal of TAX resistance. In this study, MTT assay was used to measure the non-cytotoxic dosage of IRO and Matrine on NCI-H520/TAX25 cells and determine the reversal extent of TAX resistance under non-toxic doses. In addition, RT-PCR and Western blotting were used to evaluate the mRNA expression and the protein level of survivin, Oct-4, and Sox-2 in NCI-H520/TAX25 cells using semi-quantitative methods. There was no obvious inhibition on sensitive cell strains and drug-resistant strains, when the final concentration was at lest 4 µmol/L for IRO and 100 µmol/L for Matrine. So 4 µmol/L of IRO and 100 µmol/L of Matrine were considered as the reversal dosage. When 4 µmol/L of IRO or 100 µmol/L of Matrine were used together with TAX, the sensitivity to TAX increased evidently in NCI-H520/TAX2 cells; the reversal rate of IRO and Matrine was about 1.92 (43.56/22.6 nmol/L) and 1.74 (43.56/25.0 nmol/L), respectively. The mRNA expression and the protein level of survivin, Oct-4, and Sox-2 in NCI-H520/TAX25 decreased significantly (P < 0.05) after addition of IRO or Matrine in TAX treatment, compared to that of TAX treatment alone. The decrease in both mRNA expression and protein level of survivin, Oct-4, and Sox-2 might be the molecular mechanism, by which IRO and Matrine mediate the reversal of TAX resistance.

Reasons for early onset skin cancer are poorly understood. Microarray analysis revealed overexpression of the Scca2 gene in the 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate-treated skin of Car-S mice, or line phenotypically selected for high susceptibility to two-stage skin carcinogenesis, as compared with 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate-treated skin of Car-R mice, which is resistant. A human skin squamous cell carcinoma cell line (NCI-H520) transfected with mouse Scca2 or a related gene, Scca2-rs1, both expressed in the skin, showed significantly increased tumor growth as compared with controls when injected in nude mice. Immunohistochemical analysis of samples from two independent series of Italian and Korean patients with squamous cell carcinoma of the skin indicated a significant association between SCCA2 protein expression and younger age at tumor onset. These findings provide evidence that SCCA2-like serpins mediate genetic predisposition to skin cancer in a mouse model and in humans.

Proteasome inhibitor PS-341 induces growth arrest and apoptosis of multiple myeloma (MM) cells via inactivation of NF-kappaB in vitro and has afforded some objective responses in individuals with relapsed, refractory MM. However, the activity of PS-341 against non-hematological malignancies remains to be fully elucidated. In this study, we found that PS-341 induced growth arrest and apoptosis of NCI-H520 and -H460 non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) cells in conjunction with markedly up-regulated levels of p21(waf1) and p53, and down-regulation of bcl-2 protein in these cells. Also, PS-341 caused phosphorylation of c-Jun NH(2)-terminal kinase (JNK) and c-Jun, and enhanced AP-1/DNA binding activities in these cells as measured by western blotting and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), respectively. Interestingly, when the JNK/c-Jun/AP-1 signal pathway was disrupted by the JNK inhibitor SP600125, the ability of PS-341 to inhibit the growth of NSCLC cells and to up-regulate the levels of p21(waf1) in these cells was blunted, but the expression of p53 was sustained at a high level, suggesting that the JNK/c-Jun/AP-1 signal pathway might mediate the anti-lung cancer effects of PS-341, with p21(waf1) playing the central role. Thus, PS-341 might be useful for the treatment of individuals with NSCLC.

Heptaplatin, cis-malonato [(4R,5R)-4,5-bis (amino-methyl)-2-isopropyl-1,3-dioxolane] platinum(II) (SKI-2053R, Sunpla) is a new platinum derivative with anti-tumor activity comparable to cisplatin on various cancer cell lines. Preclinical studies suggest that it is less nephrotoxic than cisplatin. This study was undertaken to examine the combined effect of heptaplatin and ionizing radiation on two established human squamous carcinoma cell lines (NCI-H520, SQ20B). The cytotoxic activity of heptaplatin was concentration-dependent in both cell lines. When low dose heptaplatin was combined with high dose ionizing radiation, there was an additive cytotoxic effect on NCI-H520 cells (P < 0.05), while a moderate dose of heptaplatin and a low dose of ionizing radiation had an additive cytotoxic effect on the growth of SQ20B cells (P < 0.05). FACS analysis and DAPI staining showed that their additive cytotoxic effects were correlated with the induction of apoptosis. Further studies are warranted using heptaplatin and ionizing radiation in squamous cell carcinoma as a substitute for cisplatin.

PC-SPES is an eight herbal mixture that was shown to have activity against prostate cancer. Recently, we purified oridonin from Rabdosia rubescens, one component of PC-SPES, by high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC). The ability of oridonin to inhibit the proliferation of cancer cells was examined by MTT assay. Oridonin effectively inhibited the proliferation of a wide variety of cancer cells including those from prostate (LNCaP, DU145, PC3), breast (MCF-7, MDA-MB231), non-small cell lung (NSCL) (NCI-H520, NCI-H460, NCI-H1299) cancers, acute promyelocytic leukemia (NB4), and glioblastoma multiforme (U118, U138) with ED50s ranging from 1.8 to 7.5 micro g/ml. TUNEL assay and cell cycle analysis showed that oridonin induced apoptosis and G0/G1 cell cycle arrest in LNCaP prostate cancer cells. In addition, expression of p21waf1 was induced in LNCaP and NCI-H520 cells in a p53-dependent manner. Interestingly, when p53 was suppressed by over-expression of E6 from human papilloma virus type 16 (HPV-16), these cells lost their sensitivity to oridonin-induced growth inhibition and apoptosis. Taken together, oridonin inhibited the proliferation of cancer cells via apoptosis and cell cycle arrest with p53 playing a central role in several cancer types which express the wild-type p53 gene. Oridonin may be a novel, adjunctive therapy for a large variety of malignancies and probably represents one of the major, active components of PC-SPES.

Humoral hypercalcemia of malignancy, a frequent complication of squamous cell carcinomas of the lung, is mediated by the parathyroid hormone-related peptide (PTHrP). This study was undertaken to determine whether 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D(3) [1,25(OH)(2)D(3)] and two nonhypercalcemic analogues. EB1089 and 22-oxa-1,25(OH)(2)D(3) (OCT), suppress PTHrP gene expression in a human lung squamous cancer cell line, NCI H520. All three compounds (1) decreased steady-state PTHrP mRNA and secreted peptide levels via a transcriptional mechanism; (2) modulated promoter activity of 1,25(OH)(2)D(3)-responsive DNA sequences; and (3) activated the vitamin D receptor (VDR) both in vitro and in vivo. Thus, EB1089 and OCT inhibit PTHrP gene expression in NCI H520 cells and modulate gene expression through the same mechanism as 1,25(OH)(2)D(3), namely, activation of the VDR. 1,25(OH)(2)D(3) is hypercalcemic in vivo. However, the noncalcemic analogues EB1089 and OCT have a therapeutic potential through suppression of PTHrP gene transcription.

Inactivation of retinoblastoma (RB) tumor suppressor function occurs frequently in lung cancer. Short-hairpin RNA can be constructed to target specific sequences and efficiently knock down protein expression. We developed a short-hairpin RNA approach to specifically target Rb in lung cancer cells to determine the influence of RB knockdown on proliferation. NCI-H520 human lung cancer cells (wild-type Rb) were transfected with pMSCVpuro-Rb3C, a plasmid containing a short-hairpin sequence targeted to human Rb. Transfectants harboring the construct were selected with puromycin. Loss of RB expression in selected cell populations was determined by immunoblotting. Proliferating cells were counted to establish growth rates. Retinoblastoma-proficient and RB-deficient tumor growth was monitored in nude mice. Transfection with pMSCVpuro-Rb3C dramatically diminished RB expression and led to aberrant expression of RB-regulated genes. Cells harboring pMSCVpuro-Rb3C grew at an increased rate compared with control cells: 480.6 +/- 37.7 versus 159.4 +/- 36.2 (relative cell count at 12 days). Tumor growth in nude mice also increased with RB knockdown compared with control mice: 135.2 +/- 73.6 mm3 versus 40.0 +/- 17.0 mm3 (tumor volume at 10 days). Inhibition of RB expression is efficiently achieved in lung cancer cells with short-hairpin RNA. Genetic targets of RB are deregulated with RB knockdown. Retinoblastoma depletion increases growth in vitro and in murine xenografts. These studies indicate that even in the context of an established tumor cell line, RB limits tumorigenic proliferation. Additionally, this model will serve as an ideal system to evaluate the role of RB activity on therapeutic response.

Aberrant expression of COX-2 occurs in many types of malignancies including colon and lung cancers, and is implicated in development and progression of cancer. The molecular mechanisms associated with aberrant expression of COX-2 in lung cancer cells remain to be fully elucidated. In this study, we found that non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) NCI-H520 and NCI-H460 cells constitutively expressed COX-2 and produced prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) as measured by Western blotting and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), respectively. Reporter assays showed that transcriptional regulation of COX-2 was blunted when either the NF-IL6 (C/EBPbeta) or nuclear factor-kappaB (NF-kappaB) binding site in the COX-2 promoter was mutated, suggesting that C/EBPbeta and NF-kappaB transcription factors have an important role in aberrant expression of COX-2 in these lung cancer cells. In addition, the eight herbal mixture PC-SPES (Lot. 5431219) caused growth arrest and apoptosis of NCI-H520 and NCI-H460 cells in association with blockade of NF-kappaB and down-regulation of C/EBPbeta, resulting in down-regulation of COX-2 and PGE2 in these cells. On the other hand, PC-SPES up-regulated the level of C/EBPbeta in these cells. Taken together, C/EBPbeta and NF-kappaB may be promising molecular targets for COX-2 inhibition in lung cancer cells. PC-SPES might be useful in the adjuvant setting for the treatment of individuals with resected NSCLC as well as other types of cancer in which COX-2 is activated.

The mouse parathyroid hormone-like hormone Pthlh(Pro) and Pthlh(Thr) variants are linked with susceptibility and resistance to skin carcinogenesis of Car-S and Car-R mice, respectively, and with in vitro effects (Oncogene, 19: 5324-5328, 2000). We have identified an additional Pthlh variant, consisting of Thr and three amino-acid changes in the C-terminus (Pthlh(SerAspTyr)), carried by an evolutionarily distant Mus spretus (SPRET/Ei) inbred strain. When transfected into NCI-H520 tumor cells, this Pthlh(SerAspTyr) variant did not stimulate tumor growth in nude mice. Analysis of cell adhesion, migration, and invasion patterns of Pthlh(Pro)-, Pthlh(Thr)-, and Pthlh(SerAspTyr)-transfected NCI-H520 cells revealed a 1.5-fold decrease in adhesion efficiency on both collagen type I and Matrigel, and a 5-6-fold increase in migration capability in Pthlh(Pro) transfectants as compared to nontransfected, vector-transfected, Pthlh(Thr)-, or Pthlh(SerAspTyr)-transfected cells. These findings suggest that the cancer modifier effects of the mouse Pthlh gene are mediated by differential cell adhesion and migration effects of PTHrP variants.

The RASSF8 gene, which maps close to the KRAS2 gene, contains a RAS-associated domain and encodes a protein that is evolutionarily conserved from fish to humans. Analysis of the RASSF8 transcript revealed a complex expression pattern of 5'-UTR mRNA isoforms in normal lung and in lung adenocarcinomas (ADCAs), with no apparent differences. However, RASSF8 gene transcript levels were approximately seven-fold-lower in lung ADCAs as compared to normal lung tissue. Expression of RASSF8 protein by transfected lung cancer cells led to inhibition of anchorage-independent growth in soft agar in A549 cells and reduction of clonogenic activity in NCI-H520 cells. These results raise the possibility protein encoded by RASSF8 is a novel tumor suppressor for lung cancer.

The unique signal transduction pathways that distinguish non-small cell lung carcinoma (NSCLC) from small cell lung carcinoma (SCLC) are poorly understood. We investigated the ability of edelfosine, an inhibitor of phosphatidylinositol-specific phospholipase C (PLC) to inhibit cell viability among four NSCLC cell lines and four SCLC cell lines. The differential sensitivity of cells to edelfosine's cytostatic and cytotoxic effects has been attributed to edelfosine-induced changes in the activities of many enzymes, including c-Jun NH2-terminal kinase (JNK), extracellular signal-regulated kinases (ERK), p38 kinase, and poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP). To investigate the role of these enzymes in edelfosine-induced cytotoxicity, we correlated edelfosine-induced changes in enzyme activity and cell viability among the different NSCLC and SCLC cell lines. We found that NSCLC cells are much more susceptible to the cytotoxic effects of this drug than are SCLC cells. Three out of the four edelfosine-sensitive NSCLC cell lines (NCI-H157, NCI-H520, NCI-H522) exhibit G2/M arrest, significant apoptosis and some degree of JNK activation in response to drug treatment. In contrast, none of the SCLC cell lines exhibit edelfosine-induced G2/M arrest or significant apoptosis. A comparison of the edelfosine-induced effects among the sensitive and resistant lung cancer lines indicates that there is little correlation between edelfosine-induced cytotoxicity and altered activities of JNK, ERK, p38, or cleavage of PARP. These results demonstrate that edelfosine-induced changes in JNK, ERK, p38, or PARP are not good predictors of cell susceptibility to edelfosine-induced cytotoxicity. Thus, edelfosine-induced inactivation of PLC may disrupt signaling cascades downstream of PLC that are unique to individual cellular environments. These findings also identify edelfosine as one of the few potential chemotherapeutic agents that has a greater cytotoxic effect against NSCLC cells than SCLC cells.

Whole-genome scan association analysis was carried out to identify genetic variants predictive of lung cancer risk in smokers and to confirm the identified variants in an independent sample. A case-control study was performed using two pools consisting of DNA from 322 German smoking lung cancer patients and 273 healthy smoking controls, respectively. A replication study was carried out using 254 Italian lung adenocarcinoma (ADCA) patients and 235 healthy controls. Patients with genotypes GG or CG for the rs1862214 single nucleotide polymorphism, 5' upstream of the programmed cell death 5 (PDCD5) gene, compared with those with the common genotype CC showed an increased risk of lung cancer (odds ratio, 1.6; 95% CI, 1.2 to 2.1) and a higher incidence of poor clinical stage disease (hazard ratio [HR], 1.9; 95% CI, 1.1 to 3.4; P = .023), nodal involvement (HR, 1.9; 95% CI, 1.1 to 3.6; P = .033), and short-term survivorship (HR, 1.8; 95% CI, 1.2 to 2.6, P = .003). PDCD5 mRNA expression levels were approximately 2.4-fold lower in lung ADCA as compared to normal lung tissue. Human NCI-H520 cancer cells transfected with PDCD5 cDNA showed decreased colony-forming ability. These results suggest that the rs1862214 polymorphism in PDCD5 is predictive for lung cancer risk and prognosis, and that PDCD5 may represent a novel tumor suppressor gene influencing lung cancer.

Integrin alpha11 (ITGA11/alpha11) is localized to stromal fibroblasts and commonly overexpressed in non-small-cell lung carcinoma (NSCLC). We hypothesized that stromal alpha11 could be important for the tumorigenicity of NSCLC cells. SV40 immortalized mouse embryonic fibroblasts established from wild-type (WT) and Itga11-deficient [knockout (KO)] mice were tested for their tumorigenicity in immune-deficient mice when implanted alone or coimplanted with the A549 human lung adenocarcinoma cells. A549 coimplanted with the fibroblasts showed a markedly enhanced tumor growth rate compared with A549, WT, or KO, which alone formed only small tumors. Importantly, the growth was significantly greater for A549+WT compared with A549+KO tumors. Reexpression of human alpha11 cDNA in KO cells rescued a tumor growth rate to that comparable with the A549+WT tumors. These findings were validated in two other NSCLC cell lines, NCI-H460 and NCI-H520. Gene expression profiling indicated that IGF2 mRNA expression level was >200 times lower in A549+KO compared with A549+WT tumors. Stable short-hairpin RNA (shRNA) down-regulation of IGF2 in WT (WT(shIGF2)) fibroblasts resulted in a decreased growth rate of A549+WT(shIGF2), compared with A549+WT tumors. The results indicate that alpha11 is an important stromal factor in NSCLC and propose a paradigm for carcinoma-stromal interaction indirectly through interaction between the matrix collagen and stromal fibroblasts to stimulate cancer cell growth.

Bcl-2/E1B 19kDa interacting protein3-like (BNIP3L) gene is a tumor suppressor gene cloned from a human fetal liver cDNA library, which is located at 8p21, one of the high frequent regions of loss of heterozygosity (LOH) in lung carcinoma. BNIP3L protein can interact with antiapoptotic proteins, such as Bcl-2, Bcl-x(L), E1B19K, which promotes apoptosis. This study was designed to explore the correlation of alteration of expression and structure of BNIP3L gene with the progression of lung cancer. The expression and structure of BNIP3L gene in 4 lung cancer cell strains and 30 tissues were determined by SP immunohistochemistry, immunoblot, semi-quantitative reverse transcription-PCR (RT-PCR), PCR-single strain conformation polymorphism (PCR-SSCP). (1) In 4 lung cancer cell strains, BNIP3L protein was not detected in A549, NCI-H460, NCI-H446, except for NCI-H520, in which the protein expression level was slightly lower than that in immortal bronchial epithelial cell strain HBE4-E6/E7. BNIP3L protein was observed in 46.7% (14/30) lung cancer tissues, while 100% (12/12) in normal lung tissues. The difference was significant in statistics (P< 0.05). (2) BNIP3L mRNA was detected in 4 lung cancer cell strains; and there existed no obvious discrepancy of the amount between these cell strains and HBE4-E6/E7. Absence or decrease of BNIP3L mRNA was observed in 26.7%(8/30) of lung cancer tissues. The average quantity of BNIP3L mRNA was 0.404+/-0.070 in lung cancer tissues, while 0.575+/-0.065 in paired normal lung tissues. The difference was significant in statistics (P< 0.05). In all the cancerous cell strains and tissues with BNIP3L mRNA, the products of RT-PCR were as long as those from their control samples in size, including the entire coding region, and no variation of BNIP3L gene structure such as absence, rearrangement, aberrant splicing were detected.(3) No point mutation was detected in all 6 exons of BNIP3L gene in 4 lung cancer cell strains and 30 tissues. BNIP3L protein expression was down-regulated in lung cancer, which might be involved in the occurrence and/or development of lung cancer. The down-regulation of BNIP3L protein expression in lung cancer was partly caused by the down-regulation of its transcription. The variation of gene structure may be not the reason of BNIP3L inactivity in lung cancer.

BHLHB3 is a basic helix-loop-helix (bHLH) domain-containing protein that acts as a transcriptional repressor. We found that BHLHB3 transcript levels were low in three human lung cancer cell lines and downregulated in human lung adenocarcinomas as compared to normal lung tissue. BHLHB3 gene overexpression inhibited colony formation of A549, NCI-H520 and NCI-H596 lung cancer cells. The reduced colony growth was likely due to inhibition of cell proliferation as suggested by the downregulation of cyclin D1 (CCND1) expression in NCI-H520 cells transfected to overexpress the BHLHB3 gene; no evidence of apoptosis was observed. These results point to the potential role of the BHLHB3 protein as a tumor suppressor for lung cancer.

Connective tissue growth factor (CTGF) is a secreted protein that belongs to CCN family. The proteins in this family are implicated in various biological processes, such as angiogenesis, adhesion, migration, and apoptosis. In this study, we explored the roles of CTGF in lung tumorigenesis. The expression levels of CTGF in 58 lung cancer samples were reduced by >2 fold in 57% of the samples compared with matched normal samples using real-time reverse transcription-PCR. These results were confirmed by immunohistochemical staining for CTGF in normal lung epithelia and lung cancer. Cellular proliferation was inhibited in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) cell lines NCI-H460, NCI-H520, NCI-H1299, and SK-MES-1 by CTGF overexpression. Partially purified CTGF suppressed lung cancer cell growth. The growth inhibition caused by CTGF overexpression was associated with growth arrest at G(0)-G(1) and prominent induction of p53 and ADP ribosylation factor. Most interestingly, overexpression of CTGF suppressed insulin-like growth factor-I-dependent Akt phosphorylation and epidermal growth factor-dependent extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1/2 phosphorylation. In summary, NSCLC cells expressed decreased levels of CTGF compared with normal lung cells; this lower expression has an effect on lung cancer cell proliferation and its cellular response to growth factors. Our data suggest that CTGF may behave as a secreted tumor suppressor protein in the normal lung, and its expression is suppressed in many NSCLCs.

Lung cancer remains one of the leading causes of cancer-related deaths worldwide with a 5-year survival rate of less than 20%. One approach to improving survival is the identification of biomarkers to detect early stage disease. In this study, we investigated the potential of the stem cell and progenitor cell marker, Musashi1 (Msi1), as a diagnostic marker and potential therapeutic target for lung cancer. Functional studies in A549 bronchioalveolar carcinoma and NCI-H520 squamous cell carcinoma cells revealed that Msi1 was enriched in spheroid cultures of tumor cells and in the CD133+ cell population. Downregulation of Msi1 by lentivirus-mediated expression of an Msi1 shRNA reduced spheroid colony proliferation. Growth inhibition was associated with reduced nuclear localization of β-catenin and inhibition of the processing of intracellular Notch. In primary lung cancer, Msi1 protein expression was elevated in 86% of 202 tissue microarray specimens, and Msi1 mRNA was increased in 80% of 118 bronchoscopic biopsies, including metastatic disease, but was rarely detected in adjacent normal lung tissue and in non-malignant diseased tissue. Msi1 was expressed in a diffuse pattern in most tumor subtypes, except in squamous cell carcinomas, where it appeared in a focal pattern in 50% of specimens. Thus, Msi1 is a sensitive and specific diagnostic marker for all lung cancer subtypes.

We report the radiosynthesis and evaluation of 3-[3,5-dimethyl-4-(4-[11C]methylpiperazinecarbonyl)-1H-pyrrol-2-ylmethylene]-2-oxo-2,3-dihydro-1H-indole-5-sulfonic acid (3-chlorophenyl)methylamide, termed [11C]SU11274 ([11C]14) for in vivo imaging of mesenchymal-epithelial transition (MET) receptor by positron emission tomography (PET). Following the synthesis of the precursor (13) that was achieved in 10 steps with a total yield of 9.7%, [11C]14 was obtained through radiomethylation in a range of 5-10% radiochemical yield and over 95% radiochemical purity. For in vivo PET studies, two human lung cancer xenograft models were established using MET-positive NCI-H1975 and MET-negative NCI-H520 cell lines. Quantitative [11C]14-PET studies showed that the tumor uptake of [11C]14 in the NCI-H1975 xenografts was significantly higher than that in the NCI-H520 xenografts, which is consistent with their corresponding immunohistochemical tissue staining patterns of MET receptors from the same animals. These studies demonstrated that [11C]14-PET is an appropriate imaging marker for quantification of MET receptor in vivo, which can facilitate efficacy evaluation in the clinical development of MET-targeted cancer therapeutics.

Juvenile Batten disease is a neurodegenerative disease caused by accelerated apoptotic death of photoreceptors and neurons attributable to defects in the CLN3 gene. CLN3 is antiapoptotic when overexpressed in NT2 neuronal precursor cells. CLN3 negatively modulates endogenous ceramide levels in NT2 cells and acts upstream of ceramide generation. Because defects in regulation of apoptosis are involved in the development of cancer, we evaluated the expression of CLN3 on both mRNA and protein levels in a variety of cancer cell lines and solid colon cancer tissue. We also observed the effect of the blocking of CLN3 protein expression on cancer cell growth, survival, ceramide production, and apoptosis by using an adenovirus-bearing antisense CLN3 construct. We show that CLN3 mRNA and protein are overexpressed in glioblastoma (U-373G and T98g), neuroblastoma (IMR-32 and SK-N-MC), prostate (Du145, PC-3, and LNCaP), ovarian (SK-OV-3, SW626, and PA-1), breast (BT-20, BT-549, and BT-474), and colon (SW1116, SW480, and HCT 116) cancer cell lines but not in pancreatic (CAPAN and As-PC-1) or lung (A-549 and NCI-H520) cancer cell lines. CLN3 is also up-regulated in mouse melanoma and breast carcinoma cancer cell lines. We found CLN3 expression is 22-330% higher than in corresponding normal colon control tissue in 8 of 10 solid colon tumors. An adenovirus-expressing antisense CLN3 (Ad-AS-CLN3) blocks CLN3 protein expression in DU-145, BT-20, SW1116, and T98g cancer cell lines as seen by Western blot. Blocking of CLN3 expression using Ad-AS-CLN3 inhibits growth and viability of cancer cells. It also causes elevation in endogenous ceramide production through de novo ceramide synthesis and results in increased apoptosis as shown by propidium iodide and JC-1 staining. This suggests that Ad-AS-CLN3 may be an option for therapy in some cancers. More importantly these results suggest that CLN3 is a novel molecular target for cancer drug discovery.

Aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases [ARS]-interacting multifunctional protein 2 (AIMP2) has been implicated in the control of cell fate and lung cell differentiation. A variant of AIMP2 lacking exon 2 (AIMP2-DX2) is expressed in different cancer cells. We previously studied the expression level of AIMP2-DX2 in several lung cell lines and reported elevated expression levels of AIMP2-DX2 in NCI-H460 and NCI-H520. Here, we report that the suppression of AIMP2-DX2 by lentivirus mediated short hairpin (sh)RNA (sh-DX2) decreased the rate of glucose uptake and glucose transporters (Gluts) in NCI-H460 cells. Down-regulation of AIMP2-DX2 reduced glycosyltransferase (GnT)-V in the Golgi apparatus, while inducing the GnT-V antagonist GnT-III. Down-regulation of AIMP2-DX2 also suppressed the epidermal growth factor receptor/mitogen activated protein kinase (EGFR/MAPK) signaling pathway, leading to the decrease of the proliferation marker Ki-67 expression in nuclei. Furthermore, dual luciferase activity reduced capdependent protein translation in cells infected with sh-DX2. These results suggest that AIMP2-DX2 may be a relevant therapeutic target for lung cancer, and that the sh-DX2 lentiviral system can be an appropriate method for lung cancer therapy.

This study investigates the anticancer effect of dehydrocostuslactone (DHE), a medicinal plant-derived sesquiterpene lactone, on human non-small cell lung cancer cell lines, A549, NCI-H460 and NCI-H520. Our results show that DHE inhibits the proliferation of A549, NCI-H460 and NCI-H520 cells. DHE-induced apoptosis in both A549 and NCI-H460 cells. DHE triggered endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress, as indicated by changes in cytosol-calcium levels, PKR-like ER kinase (PERK) phosphorylation, inositol requiring protein 1 (IRE1) and CHOP/GADD153 upregulation, X-box transcription factor-1 (XBP-1) mRNA splicing, and caspase-4 activation. The release of calcium triggered the production of ROS, which further enhances calcium overloading and subsequently activates p38, JNK and ERK1/2. Both IRE1 miRNA transfection and BAPTA-AM pretreatment inhibit DHE-mediated apoptosis, supporting the hypothesis that DHE induces cell death through ER stress. Importantly, a novel anticancer agent for the treatment of non-small cell lung cancer, and is supported by animal studies which have shown a dramatic 50% reduction in tumor size after 28 days of treatment. This study demonstrates that DHE may be a novel anticancer agent for the treatment of non-small cell lung cancer.

PTH-related peptide (PTHrP) mediates the syndrome of humoral hypercalcemia of malignancy, a frequent complication of squamous cell carcinomas of the lung. This study was undertaken to determine whether 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 [1,25-(OH)2D3] and two nonhypercalcemic analogs, EB1089 and 22-oxa-1,25-(OH)2D3 (22-oxacalcitriol), suppress serum- and epidermal growth factor (EGF)-induced PTHrP gene expression in a human lung squamous cancer cell line, NCI H520. PTHrP expression was up-regulated by serum and EGF in a concentration- and time-dependent manner. Nuclear run-on analysis showed that this induction was mediated via a transcriptional mechanism, and that sequences within promoter 1 were responsible. All three vitamin D3 compounds decreased both basal and serum- and EGF-induced steady state PTHrP messenger RNA and secreted peptide levels. These effects were again mediated via a transcriptional mechanism through sequences within promoter 1. All three vitamin D3 compounds also decreased the proliferation of NCI H520 cells in a concentration- and time-dependent manner. 1,25-(OH)2D3 is hypercalcemic in vivo. However, the noncalcemic analogs EB1089 and 22-oxa-1,25-(OH)2D3 have therapeutic potential, as they suppress not only the basal but also the growth factor-stimulated levels of PTHrP in a cancer cell line associated with hypercalcemia.

The tyrosinase (Tyr) gene encodes the enzyme tyrosinase that catalyses the conversion of L-tyrosine into DOPA (3,4-dihydroxyphenylalanine)-quinone. The albino mutation abrogates functional activity of tyrosinase resulting in deficiency of melanin pigment production in skin and retina. Tyr maps to a region in the central position of Chromosome 7 that contains a skin tumor-modifier locus. We rescued the albino mutation in transgenic mice to assess a possible role of Tyr gene in two-stage skin carcinogenesis. Transgenic expression of the functional Tyr(Cys) allele in albino mice (Tyr(Ser)) caused a reduction in skin papilloma multiplicity, in four independent experiments and at three dose levels of DMBA (9,10-dimethyl-1,2-benzanthracene). In vitro mechanistic studies demonstrated that transfection of the Tyr(Cys) allele in a human squamous cell carcinoma cell line (NCI-H520) increases tyrosinase enzyme activity and confers resistance to hydrogen peroxide-induced oxidative DNA damage. These results provide direct evidence that the Tyr gene can act as a skin cancer-modifier gene, whose mechanism of action may involve modulation of oxidative DNA damage.

The tumor suppressor gene DICE1 is located within a previously reported critical region of loss of heterozygosity on chromosome 13q14.3. Expression of the remaining DICE1 allele is down-regulated in non-small cell lung carcinomas. Ectopic expression of DICE1 cDNA by DICE1-green fluorescent protein fusion constructs resulted in inhibition of colony formation of human non-small cell lung carcinoma cell line SK-MES-1 and NCI-H520 and prostate carcinoma cell line DU145. In IGF-IR transformed Balb/c 3T3, DICE1 substantially sup-pressed growth in soft agar. These results demonstrate that DICE1 has a growth-suppressing activity and interferes with anchorage-independent growth of IGF-IR transformed tumor cells dependent upon IGF-I signaling.

Starting from d- or l-tryptophan, we have synthesized and characterized six compounds 2.29-2.31a and b that belong to a class of nitrogen heterocycles: the carboline-based homodimers. Each individual homodimer features a 1,3-trans relationship on each side of the central diketopiperazine core, but differs in absolute stereochemistry and also in substitution on the 4' and 4'' oxygens (-Bn, -CH(3), or -H). The in vitro cytotoxicity of the six compounds was evaluated by measuring the growth inhibition in NCI-H520 and PC-3 human carcinoma cells. Phenol 2.30a inhibited cancer cell growth approximately three times better than its enantiomer 2.30b and possessed a GI(50) comparable to the clinically used agent etoposide in both cell lines. We have concluded that both the stereochemistry imparted by l-tryptophan and the presence of hydroxy substituents at the 4' and 4'' positions are necessary to generate cytotoxic properties in the homodimer class. We are now employing 2.30a as a new lead compound in our efforts to discover improved indole-based cancer chemotherapeutics.

Neuroendocrine differentiation of lung tumours is characterised by the expression of several neuroendocrine markers and is confined mostly to specific histological subtypes, i.e. small cell carcinomas and carcinoids. One of the markers seen in neuroendocrine tumours, high activity of the aromatic L-amino acid decarboxylase (AADC), is helpful in distinguishing the classic and variant small cell lung tumour subtypes. Here, we have analysed the expression and quantified the level of mRNA coding for AADC in human tumour cell lines by use of the reverse transcription and polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). High amounts of mRNA were detected in classic small cell lung carcinomas and a neuroblastoma cell line. Other cell lines (melanomas, non-small cell lung carcinomas and osteosarcoma) also showed AADC expression, but the levels were 2-3 orders lower. Also, the tissue-specific (neuronal versus liver-specific) mRNA type has been estimated. Small cell lung carcinomas, neuroblastoma and melanoma expressed messenger RNA specific for neuronal tissues. Importantly, the non-small cell lung carcinoma cell lines expressed either liver-specific (non-neuronal) mRNA (cell line A549) or predominantly the neuronal (cell line NCI-H520) AADC message. These data indicate that a range of tumour cell lines transcribe the AADC gene and that two distinct types of AADC mRNA which reflect the embryonal (neuronal or non-neuronal) origin of the tumour may be produced in non-small cell lung cancer cells.

Lung cancer is the leading cause of cancer death worldwide. Its early detection is of paramount importance for diagnosis, classification, treatment, and improvement of survivorship. However, current methods are not sensitive enough to detect lung cancer in its nascent stage. We reported an aptamer-Ag-Au shell-core nanostructure-based surface-enhanced Raman scattering (SERS) assay for sensitive and specific detection, and near-infrared (NIR) photothermal therapy of lung adenocarcinoma cells (A549 cells). The nanostructures target the cells with high affinity and specificity via the specific interaction between the aptamer (a 45-base oligonucleotide) and the cell, and distinguish A549 cells from other types of cancer cells (HeLa and MCF-7 cells) and subtypes of lung cancer cells (NCI-H157, NCI-H520, NCI-H1299, and NCI-H446 cells). The nanostructures have a high capability to absorb NIR irradiation and are able to perform photothermal therapy of the cells at a very low irradiation power density (0.20 W cm(-2)) without destroying the healthy cells and the surrounding normal tissues. In addition, the nanostructures exhibit a high SERS activity. Based on the SERS signal of the labeled Raman reporter (Rh6G molecules), we can specifically detect A549 cells at a very low abundance (~10 cells per mL) and monitor the therapy process of the cancer cells. Therefore, this nanostructure-based SERS assay has great potential in specific recognition, sensitive detection, and effective photothermal therapy of lung cancer.

In the current study we present a Gompertzian model for cell growth as a function of cell phenotype using six human tumour cell lines (A-549, NCI-H596, NCI-H520, HT-29, SW-620 and U-251). Monolayer cells in exponential growth at various densities were quantified over a week by sulforhodamine B staining assay to produce cell-growth curves. A Gompertz equation was fitted to experimental data to obtain, for each cell line, three empirical growth parameters (initial cell density, cell-growth rate and carrying capacity - the maximal cell density). A cell-shape parameter named deformation coefficient D (a morphological relationship among spreading and confluent cells) was established and compared by regression analysis with the relative growth rate parameter K described by the Gompertz equation. We have found that coefficient D is directly proportional to the growth parameter K. The fit curve significantly matches the empirical data (P < 0.05), with a correlation coefficient of 0.9152. Therefore, a transformed Gompertzian growth function was obtained accordingly to D. The degree of correlation between the Gompertzian growth parameter and the coefficient D allows a new interpretation of the growth parameter K on the basis of morphological measurements of a set of tumour cell types, supporting the idea that cell-growth kinetics can be modulated by phenotypic organization of attached cells.

Cysteine-rich protein 61 (Cyr61) is a member of a family of growth factor-inducible immediate-early genes. It regulates cell adhesion, migration, proliferation, and differentiation and is involved in tumor growth. In our experiments, the role of Cyr61 in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) was examined. Expression of Cyr61 mRNA was decreased markedly in four of five human lung tumor samples compared with their normal matched lung samples. NSCLC cell lines NCI-H520 and H460, which have no endogenous Cyr61, formed 60-90% fewer colonies after being transfected with a Cyr61 cDNA expression vector than cells transfected with the same amount of empty vector. After stable transfection of a Cyr61 cDNA expression vector, proliferation of both H520-Cyr61 and H460-Cyr61 sublines decreased remarkably compared with the cells stably transfected with empty vector. The addition of antibody against Cyr61 partially rescued the growth suppression of both H520-Cyr61 and H460-Cyr61 cells. Cell cycle analysis revealed that both H520-Cyr61 and H460-Cyr61 cells developed G(1) arrest, prominently up-regulated expression of p53 and p21(WAF1), and had decreased activity of cyclin-dependent kinase 2. The increase of pocket protein pRB2/p130 was also detected in these cells. Notably, both of the Cyr61-stably transfected lung cancer cell lines developed smaller tumors than those formed by the wild-type cells in nude mice. Taken together, we conclude that Cyr61 may play a role as a tumor suppressor in NSCLC.
