It has become increasingly evident that morphologically similar gliomas may have distinct clinical phenotypes arising from diverse genetic signatures. To date, glial tumours from the Tunisian population have not been investigated. To address this, we correlated the clinico-pathology with molecular data of 110 gliomas by a combination of HM450K array, MLPA and TMA-IHC. PTEN loss and EGFR amplification were distributed in different glioma histological groups. However, 1p19q co-deletion and KIAA1549:BRAF fusion were, respectively, restricted to Oligodendroglioma and Pilocytic Astrocytoma. CDKN2A loss and EGFR overexpression were more common within high-grade gliomas. Furthermore, survival statistical correlations led us to identify Glioblastoma (GB) prognosis subtypes. In fact, significant lower overall survival (OS) was detected within GB that overexpressed EGFR and Cox2. In addition, IDH1R132H mutation seemed to provide a markedly survival advantage. Interestingly, the association of IDHR132H mutation and EGFR normal status, as well as the association of differentiation markers, defined GB subtypes with good prognosis. By contrast, poor survival GB subtypes were defined by the combination of PTEN loss with PDGFRa expression and/or EGFR amplification. Additionally, GB presenting p53-negative staining associated with CDKN2A loss or p21 positivity represented a subtype with short survival. Thus, distinct molecular subtypes with individualised prognosis were identified. Interestingly, we found a unique histone mutation in a poor survival young adult GB case. This tumour exceptionally associated the H3F3A G34R mutation and MYCN amplification as well as 1p36 loss and 10q loss. Furthermore, by exhibiting a remarkable methylation profile, it emphasised the oncogenic power of G34R mutation connecting gliomagenesis and chromatin regulation.

Diffuse intrinsic brainstem gliomas (DIBG) account for 1-2 % of adult gliomas. Their biological characteristics are scarcely understood and whether DIBG are biologically different from supratentorial gliomas remains to be established. We analyzed 17 DIBG samples for IDH1 R132H, alpha internexin, p53, and Ki67 expression, and, in a subset with sufficient DNA amount, for IDH1 and histone H3 mutational status, genomic profiling and MGMT promoter methylation status. A series of 738 adult supratentorial gliomas was used for comparison. Median age at diagnosis was 41 years (range 18.9-65.3 years). Median overall survival was 48.7 months (57 months for low-grade vs. 16 months for high-grade gliomas, p < 0.01). IDH1 sequencing revealed two mutations (IDH1 (R132G) , IDH1 (R132C) ) out of 7 DIBG whereas the R132H IDH1 enzyme was detected in 1/17 DIBG, suggesting that IDH1 mutations are mostly non R132H in DIBG (2/2), in contrast to supratentorial gliomas (31/313; p = 0.01). Mutations in histone genes H3F3A (encoding H3.3) and HIST1H3B (encoding H3.1) were found in 3/8 (37.5 %) of the DIBG (two H3F3A (K27M) and one HIST1H3B (K27M) ) versus 6/205 (2.9 %) of the supratentorial high-grade gliomas (four H3F3A (G34R) and two H3F3A (K27M) ) (p = 0.002). The CGH array showed a higher frequency of chromosome arm 1q gain, 9q gain and 11q loss in DIBG compared to the supratentorial high-grade gliomas, which had a less frequent chromosome 7 gain, and a less frequent chromosome 10 loss. No EGFR amplification was found. These data suggest that adult DIBG differ from adult supratentorial gliomas. In particular, histone genes (H3F3A (K27M) , HIST1H3B (K27M) ) mutations are frequent in adult DIBG whereas IDH1 (R132H) mutations are rare.

Pediatric central nervous system tumors are the most common solid tumor of childhood. Of these, approximately one-third are gliomas that exhibit diverse biological behaviors in the unique context of the developing nervous system. Although low-grade gliomas predominate and have favorable outcomes, up to 20% of pediatric gliomas are high-grade. These tumors are a major contributor to cancer-related morbidity and mortality in infants, children, and adolescents, with long-term survival rates of only 10 to 15%. The recent discovery of somatic oncogenic mutations affecting chromatin regulation in pediatric high-grade glioma has markedly improved our understanding of disease pathogenesis, and these findings have stimulated the development of novel therapeutic approaches targeting epigenetic regulators for disease treatment. We review the current perspective on pediatric high-grade glioma genetics and epigenetics, and discuss the emerging and experimental therapeutics targeting the unique molecular abnormalities present in these deadly childhood brain tumors.

Advances in our understanding of the biology of paediatric central nervous system (CNS) tumours have encouraged pathologists to use molecular markers alongside histopathological analysis for disease classification or prognostication and treatment stratification. In this article, we review molecular genetic alterations in paediatric CNS tumours, including those in low-grade and high-grade gliomas, ependymomas, and embryonal tumours. Some of these molecular changes with clinicopathological utility have been used for the first time in the most recent edition of the World Health Organization (WHO) classification of CNS tumours to define entities like ependymoma, RELA fusion-positive or diffuse midline glioma, H3 K27M-mutant. The classification of paediatric CNS tumours is entering a new era when histopathologists must work with molecular genetic data and their molecular pathology colleagues to provide an optimal diagnostic evaluation for their patients and clinical colleagues.

Brainstem and thalamic gliomas are rare, and they are poorly understood in adults. Genetic aberrations that occur in these tumors are still unknown. In this study, we investigated whether thalamic gliomas have different genetic aberrations and clinical outcomes compared with brainstem gliomas in adults. Forty-three glioma samples were selected, including 28 brainstem and 15 thalamic gliomas. The frequency of the K27M mutation in adult midline gliomas was 58.1%. High-grade gliomas in the thalamus were statistically significantly more numerous than brainstem gliomas. Patients with K27M mutant brainstem gliomas had a significantly shorter overall survival than patients with wild-type tumors (P = .020) by Cox regression after adjustment for other independent risk factors. However, there was no statistical tendency toward a poorer overall survival in thalamic gliomas containing the K27M mutation compared with wild-type tumors. The presence of the K27M mutation significantly corresponded with mutations in TP53 in thalamic gliomas. Interestingly, the K27M mutation was mutually exclusive with mutations in IDH1, which was detected only in brainstem gliomas. The microarray data identified 86 differentially expressed genes between brainstem and thalamic gliomas with the K27M mutation. The cyclin-dependent kinase 6 (CDK6) gene, which plays an important role in cancer pathways, was found to be differentially expressed between brainstem and thalamic gliomas with K27M mutations. Although the K27M mutation was frequently observed in adult brainstem and thalamic gliomas, this mutation tended to be associated with a poorer prognosis in brainstem gliomas but not in thalamic gliomas. Brainstem gliomas may present different genetic aberrations from thalamic gliomas. These differences may provide guidance for therapeutic decisions for the treatment of adult brainstem and thalamic gliomas, which may have different molecular targets.

Histone H3.3 (H3F3A) mutation in the codon for lysine 27 (K27M) has been found as driver mutations in pediatric glioblastoma and has been suggested to play critical roles in the pathogenesis of thalamic gliomas and diffuse intrinsic pontine gliomas. We report a case of thalamic glioma with H3F3A K27M mutation, which was detected in both the primary tumor diagnosed as diffuse astrocytoma obtained during the first surgery and also in the tumor diagnosed as anaplastic astrocytoma obtained at the second surgery. A 14-year-old girl presented with mild headache. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) showed a small intraaxial lesion in the left thalamus, which increased in size. Stereotactic tumor biopsy was performed 2 years after the initial diagnosis, and a pathological diagnosis of diffuse astrocytoma (WHO grade 2) was made. The tumor grew further and showed contrast enhancement on MRI despite 16 months of chemotherapy. Surgical removal via the transcallosal approach was then performed, and postoperative pathological diagnosis was anaplastic astrocytoma (WHO grade 3), indicating malignant transformation of the tumor. Molecular diagnosis of tumor tissue obtained at first and second surgeries revealed H3F3A K27M mutation in both primary and secondary specimens. This report demonstrates minute neuroradiological and pathological features of malignant transformation from thalamic low grade glioma with H3F3A K27M mutation. It is noteworthy that this mutation was found in this case when the tumor was still a low-grade glioma. Tissue sampling for genetic analysis is useful in patients with thalamic gliomas to predict the clinical course and efficacy of treatments.

Somatic mutations of the H3F3A and HIST1H3B genes encoding the histone H3 variants, H3.3 and H3.1, were recently identified in high-grade gliomas arising in the thalamus, pons and spinal cord of children and young adults. However, the complete range of patients and locations in which these tumors arise, as well as the morphologic spectrum and associated genetic alterations remain undefined. Here, we describe a series of 47 diffuse midline gliomas with histone H3-K27M mutation. The 25 male and 22 female patients ranged in age from 2 to 65 years (median = 14). Tumors were centered not only in the pons, thalamus, and spinal cord, but also in the third ventricle, hypothalamus, pineal region and cerebellum. Patients with pontine tumors were younger (median = 7 years) than those with thalamic (median = 24 years) or spinal (median = 25 years) tumors. A wide morphologic spectrum was encountered including gliomas with giant cells, epithelioid and rhabdoid cells, primitive neuroectodermal tumor (PNET)-like foci, neuropil-like islands, pilomyxoid features, ependymal-like areas, sarcomatous transformation, ganglionic differentiation and pleomorphic xanthoastrocytoma (PXA)-like areas. In this series, histone H3-K27M mutation was mutually exclusive with IDH1 mutation and EGFR amplification, rarely co-occurred with BRAF-V600E mutation, and was commonly associated with p53 overexpression, ATRX loss (except in pontine gliomas), and monosomy 10.

Recent studies have identified a Lys 27-to-methionine (K27M) mutation at one allele of H3F3A, one of the two genes encoding histone H3 variant H3.3, in 60% of high-grade pediatric glioma cases. The median survival of this group of patients after diagnosis is ∼1 yr. Here we show that the levels of H3K27 di- and trimethylation (H3K27me2 and H3K27me3) are reduced globally in H3.3K27M patient samples due to the expression of the H3.3K27M mutant allele. Remarkably, we also observed that H3K27me3 and Ezh2 (the catalytic subunit of H3K27 methyltransferase) at chromatin are dramatically increased locally at hundreds of gene loci in H3.3K27M patient cells. Moreover, the gain of H3K27me3 and Ezh2 at gene promoters alters the expression of genes that are associated with various cancer pathways. These results indicate that H3.3K27M mutation reprograms epigenetic landscape and gene expression, which may drive tumorigenesis.

Pediatric glioblastomas (GBM) including diffuse intrinsic pontine gliomas (DIPG) are devastating brain tumors with no effective therapy. Here, we investigated clinical and biological impacts of histone H3.3 mutations. Forty-two DIPGs were tested for H3.3 mutations. Wild-type versus mutated (K27M-H3.3) subgroups were compared for HIST1H3B, IDH, ATRX and TP53 mutations, copy number alterations and clinical outcome. K27M-H3.3 occurred in 71 %, TP53 mutations in 77 % and ATRX mutations in 9 % of DIPGs. ATRX mutations were more frequent in older children (p < 0.0001). No G34V/R-H3.3, IDH1/2 or H3.1 mutations were identified. K27M-H3.3 DIPGs showed specific copy number changes, including all gains/amplifications of PDGFRA and MYC/PVT1 loci. Notably, all long-term survivors were H3.3 wild type and this group of patients had better overall survival. K27M-H3.3 mutation defines clinically and biologically distinct subgroups and is prevalent in DIPG, which will impact future therapeutic trial design. K27M- and G34V-H3.3 have location-based incidence (brainstem/cortex) and potentially play distinct roles in pediatric GBM pathogenesis. K27M-H3.3 is universally associated with short survival in DIPG, while patients wild-type for H3.3 show improved survival. Based on prognostic and therapeutic implications, our findings argue for H3.3-mutation testing at diagnosis, which should be rapidly integrated into the clinical decision-making algorithm, particularly in atypical DIPG.

Mutations in H3F3A, which encodes histone H3.3, commonly occur in pediatric glioblastoma. Additionally, H3F3A K27M substitutions occur in gliomas that arise at midline locations (eg, pons, thalamus, spine); moreover, this substitution occurs mainly in tumors in children and adolescents. Here, we sought to determine the association between H3F3A mutations and adult thalamic glioma. Genomic H3F3A was sequenced from 20 separate thalamic gliomas. Additionally, for 14 of the 20 gliomas, 639 genes--including cancer-related genes and chromatin-modifier genes--were sequenced, and the Infinium HumanMethylation450K BeadChip was used to examine DNA methylation across the genome. Of the 20 tumors, 18 were high-grade thalamic gliomas, and of these 18, 11 were from patients under 50 years of age (median age, 38 y; range, 17-46), and 7 were from patients over 50 years of age. The H3F3A K27M mutation was present in 10 of the 11 (91%) younger patients and absent from all 7 older patients. Additionally, H3F3A K27M was not detected in the 2 diffuse astrocytomas. Further sequencing revealed recurrent mutations in TP53, ATRX, NF1, and EGFR. Gliomas with H3F3A K27M from pediatric or young adult patients had similar, characteristic DNA methylation profiles. In contrast, thalamic gliomas with wild-type H3F3A had DNA methylation profiles similar to those of hemispheric glioblastomas. We found that high-grade thalamic gliomas from young adults, like those from children and adolescents, frequently had H3F3A K27M.

Sequencing of pediatric gliomas has identified missense mutations Lys27Met (K27M) and Gly34Arg/Val (G34R/V) in genes encoding histone H3.3 (H3F3A) and H3.1 (HIST3H1B). We report that human diffuse intrinsic pontine gliomas (DIPGs) containing the K27M mutation display significantly lower overall amounts of H3 with trimethylated lysine 27 (H3K27me3) and that histone H3K27M transgenes are sufficient to reduce the amounts of H3K27me3 in vitro and in vivo. We find that H3K27M inhibits the enzymatic activity of the Polycomb repressive complex 2 through interaction with the EZH2 subunit. In addition, transgenes containing lysine-to-methionine substitutions at other known methylated lysines (H3K9 and H3K36) are sufficient to cause specific reduction in methylation through inhibition of SET-domain enzymes. We propose that K-to-M substitutions may represent a mechanism to alter epigenetic states in a variety of pathologies.

Histone H3 lysine(27)-to-methionine (H3K27M) gain-of-function mutations occur in highly aggressive pediatric gliomas. We established a Drosophila animal model for the pathogenic histone H3K27M mutation and show that its overexpression resembles polycomb repressive complex 2 (PRC2) loss-of-function phenotypes, causing derepression of PRC2 target genes and developmental perturbations. Similarly, an H3K9M mutant depletes H3K9 methylation levels and suppresses position-effect variegation in various Drosophila tissues. The histone H3K9 demethylase KDM3B/JHDM2 associates with H3K9M-containing nucleosomes, and its misregulation in Drosophila results in changes of H3K9 methylation levels and heterochromatic silencing defects. We have established histone lysine-to-methionine mutants as robust in vivo tools for inhibiting methylation pathways that also function as biochemical reagents for capturing site-specific histone-modifying enzymes, thus providing molecular insight into chromatin signaling pathways.

Pediatric brainstem gliomas often harbor oncogenic K27M mutation of histone H3.3. Here we show that GSKJ4 pharmacologic inhibition of K27 demethylase JMJD3 increases cellular H3K27 methylation in K27M tumor cells and demonstrate potent antitumor activity both in vitro against K27M cells and in vivo against K27M xenografts. Our results demonstrate that increasing H3K27 methylation by inhibiting K27 demethylase is a valid therapeutic strategy for treating K27M-expressing brainstem glioma.

Over 70% of diffuse intrinsic pediatric gliomas, an aggressive brainstem tumor, harbor heterozygous mutations that create a K27M amino acid substitution (methionine replaces lysine 27) in the tail of histone H3.3. The role of the H3.3K27M mutation in tumorigenesis is not fully understood. Here, we use a human embryonic stem cell system to model this tumor. We show that H3.3K27M expression synergizes with p53 loss and PDGFRA activation in neural progenitor cells derived from human embryonic stem cells, resulting in neoplastic transformation. Genome-wide analyses indicate a resetting of the transformed precursors to a developmentally more primitive stem cell state, with evidence of major modifications of histone marks at several master regulator genes. Drug screening assays identified a compound targeting the protein menin as an inhibitor of tumor cell growth in vitro and in mice.

Brain tumors are the most common solid tumors in children. Pediatric high-grade glioma (HGG) accounts for ∼8-12 % of these brain tumors and is a devastating disease as 70-90 % of patients die within 2 years of diagnosis. The failure to advance therapy for these children over the last 30 years is largely due to limited knowledge of the molecular basis for these tumors and a lack of disease models. Recently, sequencing of tumor cells revealed that histone H3 is frequently mutated in pediatric HGG, with up to 78 % of diffuse intrinsic pontine gliomas (DIPGs) carrying K27M and 36 % of non-brainstem gliomas carrying either K27M or G34R/V mutations. Although mutations in many chromatin modifiers have been identified in cancer, this was the first demonstration that histone mutations may be drivers of disease. Subsequent studies have identified high-frequency mutation of histone H3 to K36M in chondroblastomas and to G34W/L in giant cell tumors of bone, which are diseases of adolescents and young adults. Interestingly, the G34 mutations, the K36M mutations, and the majority of K27M mutations occur in genes encoding the replacement histone H3.3. Here, we review the peculiar characteristics of histone H3.3 and use this information as a backdrop to highlight current thinking about how the identified mutations may contribute to disease development.
