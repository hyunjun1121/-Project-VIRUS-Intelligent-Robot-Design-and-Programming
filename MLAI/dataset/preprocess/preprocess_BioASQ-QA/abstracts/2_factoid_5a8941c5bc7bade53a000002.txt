Cyclic-AMP response element-binding protein (CREB) signaling has a critical role in the formation of memories. CREB signaling is dysfunctional in the brains of mouse models of Alzheimer's disease (AD), and evidence suggests that CREB signaling may be disrupted in human AD brains as well. Here, we show that both CREB and its activated form pCREB-Ser(133) (pCREB) are reduced in the prefrontal cortex of AD patients. Similarly, the transcription cofactors CREB-binding protein (CBP) and p300 are reduced in the prefrontal cortex of AD patients, indicating additional dysfunction of CREB signaling in AD. Importantly, we show that pCREB expression is reduced in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) of AD subjects. In addition, pCREB levels in PBMC positively correlated with pCREB expression in the postmortem brain of persons with AD. These results suggest that pCREB expression in PBMC may be indicative of its expression in the brain, and thus offers the intriguing possibility of pCREB as a biomarker of cognitive function and disease progression in AD.

The ability to adequately measure the phosphorylation state of a protein has major biological as well as clinical relevance. Due to its variable nature, reversible protein phosphorylations are sensitive to changes in the tissue environment. Stabilizor<sup>TM</sup> T1 is a system for rapid inactivation of enzymatic activity in biological samples. Enzyme inactivation is accomplished using thermal denaturation in a rapid, homogeneous, and reproducible fashion without the need of added chemical inhibitors. Using pCREB(Ser133) as a model system, the applicability of the Stabilizor system to preserve a rapidly lost phosphorylation is shown.
