The U-box E3 ubiquitin ligase CHIP (C terminus of Hsc70-interacting protein) binds Hsp90 and/or Hsp70 via its tetratricopeptide repeat (TPR), facilitating ubiquitination of the chaperone-bound client proteins. Mechanisms that regulate the activity of CHIP are, at present, poorly understood. We previously reported that Ca(2+)/S100 proteins directly associate with the TPR proteins, such as Hsp70/Hsp90-organizing protein (Hop), kinesin light chain, Tom70, FKBP52, CyP40, and protein phosphatase 5 (PP5), leading to the dissociation of the interactions of the TPR proteins with their target proteins. Therefore, we have hypothesized that Ca(2+)/S100 proteins can interact with CHIP and regulate its function. GST pulldown assays indicated that Ca(2+)/S100A2 and S100P bind to the TPR domain and lead to interference with the interactions of CHIP with Hsp70, Hsp90, HSF1, and Smad1. In vitro ubiquitination assays indicated that Ca(2+)/S100A2 and S100P are efficient and specific inhibitors of CHIP-mediated ubiquitination of Hsp70, Hsp90, HSF1, and Smad1. Overexpression of S100A2 and S100P suppressed CHIP-chaperone complex-dependent mutant p53 ubiquitination and degradation in Hep3B cells. The association of the S100 proteins with CHIP provides a Ca(2+)-dependent regulatory mechanism for the ubiquitination and degradation of intracellular proteins by the CHIP-proteasome pathway.

The regulation of the aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AhR) protein levels has been an area of keen interest, given its important role in mediating the cellular adaptation and toxic response to several environmental pollutants. The carboxyl terminus of hsc70-interacting protein (CHIP) ubiquitin ligase was previously associated with the regulation of the aryl hydrocarbon receptor, although the mechanisms were not directly demonstrated. In this study, we established that CHIP could associate with the AhR at cellular levels of these two proteins, suggesting a potential role for CHIP in the regulation of the AhR complex. The analysis of the sucrose-gradient-fractionated in vitro translated AhR complexes revealed that CHIP can mediate hsp90 ubiquitination while cooperating with unidentified factors to promote the ubiquitination of mature unliganded AhR complexes. In addition, the immunophilin-like protein XAP2 was able to partially protect the AhR from CHIP-mediated ubiquitination in vitro. This protection required the direct interaction of the XAP2 with the AhR complex. Surprisingly, CHIP silencing in Hepa-1c1c7 cells by siRNA methods did not reveal the function of CHIP in the AhR complex, because it did not affect well-characterized activities of the AhR nor affect its steady-state protein levels. However, the presence of potential compensatory mechanisms may be confounding this particular observation. Our results suggest a model where the E3 ubiquitin ligase CHIP cooperates with other ubiquitination factors to remodel native AhR-hsp90 complexes and where co-chaperones such as the XAP2 may affect the ability of CHIP to target AhR complexes for ubiquitination.

The E3 ubiquitin ligase CHIP (C-terminus of Hsc70-interacting protein) is believed to be a central player in the cellular triage decision, as it links the molecular chaperones Hsp70/Hsc70 and Hsp90 to the ubiquitin proteasomal degradation pathway. To better understand the decision process, we determined the affinity of CHIP for Hsp70 and Hsp90 using isothermal titration calorimetry. We analyzed the influence of CHIP on the ATPase cycles of both chaperones in the presence of co-chaperones and a substrate, and determined the ubiquitination efficacy of CHIP in the presence of the chaperones. We found that CHIP has a sixfold higher affinity for Hsp90 compared with Hsc70. CHIP had no influence on ADP dissociation or ATP association, but reduced the Hsp70 cochaperone Hdj1-stimulated single-turnover ATPase rates of Hsc70 and Hsp70. CHIP did not influence the ATPase cycle of Hsp90 in the absence of co-chaperones or in the presence of the Hsp90 cochaperones Aha1 or p23. Polyubiquitination of heat-denatured luciferase and the native substrate p53 was much more efficient in the presence of Hsc70 and Hdj1 than in the presence of Hsp90, indicating that CHIP preferentially ubiquitinates Hsp70-bound substrates.

C-terminal Hsp-interacting protein (CHIP) is an HSP70 and HSP90 interacting co-chaperone and an E3 ubiquitin ligase. Previous studies have reported the role of CHIP in cancer progression by targeting protein degradation. However, its role and clinical significance in esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC) has not been elucidated. We investigated the correlation of CHIP expression and clinical outcome in a group of T3N1-3M0 surgically resected ESCCs. Tissue microarrays constructed of 234 surgically resected T3N1-3M0 ESCC primary tumors (PTs) and 163 paired metastatic lymph nodes (MLNs), and sections of 56 cancer-adjacent normal epithelial blocks were used for CHIP evaluation by immunohistochemistry. The clinical and prognostic significance of CHIP expression was analyzed statistically. The expression level of CHIP in ESCC MLNs was significantly higher than that in PTs (P < 0.001). Patients with low MLNs' CHIP expression demonstrated better overall survival than those with high CHIP expression (median, 44 vs. 17.9 months; P = 0.010). Multivariate analysis showed that the MLNs' CHIP expression level was an independent prognostic factor in ESCC (relative risk, 2.157; P = 0.028). High expression of CHIP in MLNs suggests poor prognosis for patients with resected T3N1-3M0 ESCC. The result suggests that considering the protein expression of metastatic tumors is important for prognostic prediction.
