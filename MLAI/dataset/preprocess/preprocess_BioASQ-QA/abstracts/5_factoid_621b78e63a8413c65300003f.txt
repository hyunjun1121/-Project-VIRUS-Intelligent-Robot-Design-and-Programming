Lipid-linked oligosaccharides (LLOs) play an important role in the N-glycosylation pathway as the donor substrate of oligosaccharyltransferases (OSTs), which are responsible for the <i>en bloc</i> transfer of glycan chains onto a nascent polypeptide. The lipid component of LLO in both eukarya and archaea consists of a dolichol, and an undecaprenol in prokarya, whereas the number of isoprene units may change between species. Given the potential relevance of LLOs and their related enzymes to diverse biotechnological applications, obtaining reliable LLO models from distinct domains of life could support further studies on complex formation and their processing by OSTs, as well as protein engineering on such systems. In this work, molecular modeling techniques, such as quantum mechanics calculations, molecular dynamics simulations, and metadynamics were employed to study eukaryotic (Glc<sub>3</sub>-Man<sub>9</sub>-GlcNAc<sub>2</sub>-PP-Dolichol), bacterial (Glc<sub>1</sub>-GalNAc<sub>5</sub>-Bac<sub>1</sub>-PP-Undecaprenol), and archaeal (Glc<sub>1</sub>-Man1-Gal<sub>1</sub>-Man1-Glc<sub>1</sub>-Gal<sub>1</sub>-Glc<sub>1</sub>-P-Dolichol) LLOs in membrane bilayers. Microsecond molecular dynamics simulations and metadynamics calculations of LLOs revealed that glycan chains are more prone to interact with the membrane lipid head groups, while the PP linkages are positioned at the lipid phosphate head groups level. The dynamics of isoprenoid chains embedded within the bilayer are described, and membrane dynamics and related properties are also investigated. Overall, there are similarities regarding the structure and dynamics of the eukaryotic, the bacterial, and the archaeal LLOs in bilayers, which can support the comprehension of their association with OSTs. These data may support future studies on the transferring mechanism of the oligosaccharide chain to an acceptor protein.

Protein glycosylation, or the attachment of sugar moieties (glycans) to proteins, is important for protein stability, activity, and immunogenicity. However, understanding the roles and regulations of site-specific glycosylation events remains a significant challenge due to several technological limitations. These limitations include a lack of available tools for biochemical characterization of enzymes involved in glycosylation. A particular challenge is the synthesis of oligosaccharyltransferases (OSTs), which catalyze the attachment of glycans to specific amino acid residues in target proteins. The difficulty arises from the fact that canonical OSTs are large (>70 kDa) and possess multiple transmembrane helices, making them difficult to overexpress in living cells. Here, we address this challenge by establishing a bacterial cell-free protein synthesis platform that enables rapid production of a variety of OSTs in their active conformations. Specifically, by using lipid nanodiscs as cellular membrane mimics, we obtained yields of up to 420 μg/ml for the single-subunit OST enzyme, "Protein glycosylation B" (PglB) from Campylobacter jejuni, as well as for three additional PglB homologs from Campylobacter coli, Campylobacter lari, and Desulfovibrio gigas. Importantly, all of these enzymes catalyzed N-glycosylation reactions in vitro with no purification or processing needed. Furthermore, we demonstrate the ability of cell-free synthesized OSTs to glycosylate multiple target proteins with varying N-glycosylation acceptor sequons. We anticipate that this broadly applicable production method will advance glycoengineering efforts by enabling preparative expression of membrane-embedded OSTs from all kingdoms of life.

Oligosaccharyltransferases (OSTs) mediate the en bloc transfer of N-glycan intermediates onto the asparagine residue in glycosylation sequons (N-X-S/T, X≠P). These enzymes are typically heteromeric complexes composed of several membrane-associated subunits, in which STT3 is highly conserved as a catalytic core. Metazoan organisms encode two STT3 genes (STT3A and STT3B) in their genome, resulting in the formation of at least two distinct OST isoforms consisting of shared subunits and complex specific subunits. The STT3A isoform of OST primarily glycosylates substrate polypeptides cotranslationally, whereas the STT3B isoform is involved in cotranslational and post-translocational glycosylation of sequons that are skipped by the STT3A isoform. Here, we describe mutant constructs of monomeric enhanced green fluorescent protein (mEGFP), which are susceptible to STT3B-dependent N-glycosylation. The endoplasmic reticulum-localized mEGFP (ER-mEGFP) mutants contained an N-glycosylation sequon at their C-terminus and exhibited increased fluorescence in response to N-glycosylation. Isoform-specific glycosylation of the constructs was confirmed by using STT3A- or STT3B-knockout cell lines. Among the mutant constructs that we tested, the ER-mEGFP mutant containing the N<sub>185</sub> -C<sub>186</sub> -T<sub>187</sub> sequon was the best substrate for the STT3B isoform in terms of glycosylation efficiency and fluorescence change. Our results suggest that the mutant ER-mEGFP is useful for monitoring STT3B-dependent post-translocational N-glycosylation in cells of interest, such as those from putative patients with a congenital disorder of glycosylation.

Bioconjugate vaccines, consisting of polysaccharides attached to carrier proteins, are enzymatically generated using prokaryotic glycosylation systems in a process termed bioconjugation. Key to bioconjugation are a group of enzymes known as oligosaccharyltransferases (OTases) that transfer polysaccharides to engineered carrier proteins containing conserved amino acid sequences known as sequons. The most recently discovered OTase, PglS, has been shown to have the broadest substrate scope, transferring many different types of bacterial glycans including those with glucose at the reducing end. However, PglS is currently the least understood in terms of the sequon it recognizes. PglS is a pilin-specific O-linking OTase that naturally glycosylates a single protein, ComP. In addition to ComP, we previously demonstrated that an engineered carrier protein containing a large fragment of ComP is also glycosylated by PglS. Here we sought to identify the minimal ComP sequon sufficient for PglS glycosylation. We tested >100 different ComP fragments individually fused to Pseudomonas aeruginosa exotoxin A (EPA), leading to the identification of an 11-amino acid sequence sufficient for robust glycosylation by PglS. We also demonstrate that the placement of the ComP sequon on the carrier protein is critical for stability and subsequent glycosylation. Moreover, we identify novel sites on the surface of EPA that are amenable to ComP sequon insertion and find that Cross-Reactive Material 197 fused to a ComP fragment is also glycosylated. These results represent a significant expansion of the glycoengineering toolbox as well as our understanding of bacterial O-linking sequons.

Glycosylation is increasingly recognised as a common protein modification within bacterial proteomes. While great strides have been made in identifying species that contain glycosylation systems, our understanding of the proteins and sites targeted by these systems is far more limited. Within this work we explore the conservation of glycoproteins and glycosylation sites across the pan-Burkholderia glycoproteome. Using a multi-protease glycoproteomic approach, we generate high-confidence glycoproteomes in two widely utilized B. cenocepacia strains, K56-2 and H111. This resource reveals glycosylation occurs exclusively at Serine residues and that glycoproteins/glycosylation sites are highly conserved across B. cenocepacia isolates. This preference for glycosylation at Serine residues is observed across at least 9 Burkholderia glycoproteomes, supporting that Serine is the dominant residue targeted by PglL-mediated glycosylation across the Burkholderia genus. Combined, this work demonstrates that PglL enzymes of the Burkholderia genus are Serine-preferring oligosaccharyltransferases that target conserved and shared protein substrates.
