Mov10 is an RNA helicase that modulates access of Argonaute 2 to microRNA recognition elements in mRNAs. We examined the role of Mov10 in Xenopus laevis development and show a critical role for Mov10 in gastrulation and in the development of the central nervous system (CNS). Knockdown of maternal Mov10 in Xenopus embryos using a translation blocking morpholino led to defects in gastrulation and the development of notochord and paraxial mesoderm, and a failure to neurulate. RNA sequencing of the Mov10 knockdown embryos showed significant upregulation of many mRNAs when compared with controls at stage 10.5 (including those related to the cytoskeleton, adhesion, and extracellular matrix, which are involved in those morphogenetic processes). Additionally, the degradation of the miR-427 target mRNA, cyclin A1, was delayed in the Mov10 knockdowns. These defects suggest that Mov10's role in miRNA-mediated regulation of the maternal to zygotic transition could lead to pleiotropic effects that cause the gastrulation defects. Additionally, the knockdown of zygotic Mov10 showed that it was necessary for normal head, eye, and brain development in Xenopus consistent with a recent study in the mouse. Mov10 is essential for gastrulation and normal CNS development. Developmental Dynamics 247:660-671, 2018. Â© 2017 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.
