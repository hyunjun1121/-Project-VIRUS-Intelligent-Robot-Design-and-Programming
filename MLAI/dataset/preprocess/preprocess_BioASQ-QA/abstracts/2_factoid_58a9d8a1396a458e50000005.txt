Respirasomes are macromolecular assemblies of the respiratory chain complexes I, III and IV in the inner mitochondrial membrane. We determined the structure of supercomplex I<sub>1</sub>III<sub>2</sub>IV<sub>1</sub> from bovine heart mitochondria by cryo-EM at 9 Å resolution. Most protein-protein contacts between complex I, III and IV in the membrane are mediated by supernumerary subunits. Of the two Rieske iron-sulfur cluster domains in the complex III dimer, one is resolved, indicating that this domain is immobile and unable to transfer electrons. The central position of the active complex III monomer between complex I and IV in the respirasome is optimal for accepting reduced quinone from complex I over a short diffusion distance of 11 nm, and delivering reduced cytochrome <i>c</i> to complex IV. The functional asymmetry of complex III provides strong evidence for directed electron flow from complex I to complex IV through the active complex III monomer in the mammalian supercomplex.

Structure determination by cryo-electron microscopy has approached atomic resolution and helped solve structures of large membrane-protein complexes that resisted crystallography. The 4.0 Å cryo-EM structure of one of the most intricate enzyme systems, the respirasome, in the mitochondrial inner membrane is reported in this issue of Cell.
