The prediction of the three-dimensional (3D) structure of proteins from the amino acid sequence made a stunning breakthrough reaching atomic accuracy. Using the neural network-based method AlphaFold2, 3D structures of almost the entire human proteome have been predicted and made available (https://www.alphafold.ebi.ac.uk). To gain insight into how well AlphaFold2 structures represent the conformation of proteins in solution, I here compare the AlphaFold2 structures of selected small proteins with their 3D structures that were determined by nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy. Proteins were selected for which the 3D solution structures were determined on the basis of a very large number of distance restraints and residual dipolar couplings and are thus some of the best-resolved solution structures of proteins to date. The quality of the backbone conformation of the AlphaFold2 structures is assessed by fitting a large set of experimental residual dipolar couplings (RDCs). The analysis shows that experimental RDCs fit extremely well to the AlphaFold2 structures predicted for GB3, DinI, and ubiquitin. In the case of GB3, the accuracy of the AlphaFold2 structure even surpasses that of a 1.1 Å crystal structure. Fitting of experimental RDCs furthermore allows identification of AlphaFold2 structures that are best representative of the protein's conformation in solution as seen for the EF hands of the N-terminal domain of Ca<sup>2+</sup> -ligated calmodulin. Taken together, the analysis shows that structures predicted by AlphaFold2 can be highly representative of the solution conformation of proteins. The combination of AlphaFold2 structures with RDCs promises to be a powerful approach to study structural changes in proteins.

Proteins are essential to life, and understanding their structure can facilitate a mechanistic understanding of their function. Through an enormous experimental effort<sup>1-4</sup>, the structures of around 100,000 unique proteins have been determined<sup>5</sup>, but this represents a small fraction of the billions of known protein sequences<sup>6,7</sup>. Structural coverage is bottlenecked by the months to years of painstaking effort required to determine a single protein structure. Accurate computational approaches are needed to address this gap and to enable large-scale structural bioinformatics. Predicting the three-dimensional structure that a protein will adopt based solely on its amino acid sequence-the structure prediction component of the 'protein folding problem'<sup>8</sup>-has been an important open research problem for more than 50 years<sup>9</sup>. Despite recent progress<sup>10-14</sup>, existing methods fall far short of atomic accuracy, especially when no homologous structure is available. Here we provide the first computational method that can regularly predict protein structures with atomic accuracy even in cases in which no similar structure is known. We validated an entirely redesigned version of our neural network-based model, AlphaFold, in the challenging 14th Critical Assessment of protein Structure Prediction (CASP14)<sup>15</sup>, demonstrating accuracy competitive with experimental structures in a majority of cases and greatly outperforming other methods. Underpinning the latest version of AlphaFold is a novel machine learning approach that incorporates physical and biological knowledge about protein structure, leveraging multi-sequence alignments, into the design of the deep learning algorithm.

AlphaFold 2 (AF2) was the star of CASP14, the last biannual structure prediction experiment. Using novel deep learning, AF2 predicted the structures of many difficult protein targets at or near experimental resolution. Here, we present our perspective of why AF2 works and show that it is a very sophisticated fold recognition algorithm that exploits the completeness of the library of single domain PDB structures. It has also learned local side chain packing rearrangements that enable it to refine proteins to high resolution. The benefits and limitations of its ability to predict the structures of many more proteins at or close to atomic detail are discussed.
