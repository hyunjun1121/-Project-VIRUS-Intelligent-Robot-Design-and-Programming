454 patients with prostate adenocarcinoma were accidentally overexposed to radiation in Epinal hospital, France, between August 1999 and January 2007. We aimed toevaluate whether radiation-induced CD4 or CD8 T-lymphocyte apoptosis (RILA) correlates with the severity of radiation toxicity. Between 2007 and 2013, all patients who received more than 108% of the prescribed radiation dose, after correction of the treatment plan, were convened, and blood was sampled at 6-months follow-up. Maximal Digestive toxicity (MDT) and maximal urinary toxicity (MUT) were graded using the Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (NCI-CTCAE) v3.0 scale. RILA was assessed using flow cytometry. 245 patients were included in our study. After a median follow-up of 4.8 years, the MDT and MUT reached grade 3-4 in 37 patients and 56 patients, respectively. Patients with prostatectomy exhibited a statistically higher grade of MUT compared with those treated with definitive radiotherapy (<i>p</i>=0.03). The median RILA values were 11.8% and 15.3% for CD4 and CD8 T-lymphocytes, respectively. We found no significant correlation between CD4 or CD8 RILA and either MDT or MUT. RILA does not correlate with the inter-individual variation in MDT or MUT in the largest cohort of patients overexposed to radiation. The magnitude of the overdosage probably overrides biological predictors of toxicity, including individual radiosensitivity.

Radiation-induced lymphocyte apoptosis (RILA) has been suggested as a predictive assay for adverse late reactions after radiotherapy. Thus, low RILA values of T-lymphocyte subpopulations have been associated with increased risk for various endpoints at 2 to 3 years of follow-up. The purpose was to test if such associations persist for specific endpoints (subcutaneous fibrosis, telangiectasia) in breast cancer patients with at least 10 years of follow-up.<b>Experimental Design:</b> Two hundred and seventy-two female patients who had received breast-conserving therapy within the German ISE study were included (median follow-up: 11.6 years). Radiotherapy-induced side effects were scored according to the Late Effects in Normal Tissues-Subjective, Objective, Management, and Analytic (LENT-SOMA) classification system. RILA in the CD4<sup>+</sup>, CD8<sup>+</sup>, and natural killer (NK) subpopulations from peripheral blood was analyzed by flow cytometry. Multivariate predictive modeling was performed including relevant clinical risk factors. Low CD4<sup>+</sup> RILA was associated with increased risk for both fibrosis (<i>P</i> = 0.011) and telangiectasia (<i>P</i> < 0.001). For fibrosis, the association was stronger outside the surgical area (Fib<sub>out</sub>; <i>P</i> = 0.004) than within (Fib<sub>in</sub>; <i>P</i> = 0.17). Predictive multivariate modeling including clinical risk factors yielded OR of 3.48 (95% confidence interval, 1.84-6.58) for any fibrosis and 8.60 (2.71-27.3) for telangiectasia. Addition of CD4<sup>+</sup> RILA to the clinical variables improved discrimination (c statistics) from 0.62 to 0.68 for any fibrosis, 0.62 to 0.66 for Fib<sub>in</sub>, 0.61 to 0.69 for Fib<sub>out</sub>, and from 0.65 to 0.76 for telangiectasia. CD8<sup>+</sup> and NK RILA were not significantly associated with radiotherapy-related late reactions. The results provide first evidence that low CD4<sup>+</sup> RILA is associated with increased subcutaneous fibrosis and telangiectasia even after 10 years. This supports the potential usefulness for predicting individual clinical risk.
