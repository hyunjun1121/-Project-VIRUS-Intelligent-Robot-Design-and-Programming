Anti-tumour necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha) therapies represent an important advancement in therapy for rheumatoid arthritis (RA). However, there remains a proportion of patients who do not improve despite therapy. These drugs are expensive and have the potential of serious toxicity. Therefore, it would be ideal to predict the patients who will respond, so that the use of these drugs can be targetted. To identify the clinical factors present at the start of anti-TNF-alpha therapy that are associated with response at 6 months in patients with RA. The British Society for Rheumatology (BSR) Biologics Register collects detailed data on all patients with a rheumatic disease receiving biologic therapy in the UK. We studied all patients with RA who had started etanercept (ETA) or infliximab (INF) and had achieved a minimum 6 months follow-up by 1 October, 2004. The disease status at the baseline and at 6 months was assessed using the Disease Activity Score (DAS28). The response was classified according to the European League against Rheumatism (EULAR) improvement criteria. The effect of baseline characteristics on response was studied using multivariate ordinal logistic regression. 2879 patients were included in this analysis (1267 ETA, 1612 INF). At the start of therapy, the mean age was 55 yrs, disease duration 14 yrs, baseline DAS28 6.7 and health assessment questionnaire (HAQ) 2.1. In all, 28% of ETA and 86% of INF patients were receiving methotrexate. After 6 months, 18% had a good EULAR response, of whom 9% were considered to be in remission and 50% had a moderate response. There was no overall difference in response rate between the two anti-TNF-alpha therapies. A higher baseline HAQ score correlated with a lower response rate while a better response was associated with the current use of NSAIDs and the use of methotrexate (MTX), although the latter only reached statistical significance with ETA [OR 1.82 (95% CI 1.38-2.40)]. There was a lower response rate among current smokers, particularly in patients receiving INF [OR 0.77 (95% CI 0.60-0.99)]. Age, disease duration, rheumatoid factor and the previous number of disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs (DMARDs) did not predict response to either drug. However, females were less likely to achieve remission. These data support an improved outcome among patients receiving MTX in combination with anti-TNF-alpha therapies. However, the most disabled patients were less likely to respond, despite concurrent MTX. The benefits of NSAIDs may reflect the relative absence of comorbidities in patients who can tolerate these drugs or the continuing presence of reversible inflammatory symptoms. The association of smoking and poor outcome with INF is a novel finding and may reflect alterations in pharmacokinetics. The inability of other baseline disease characteristics to predict the outcome suggests that other factors, including potential genetic differences in drug metabolism, may be influencing the response to anti-TNF-alpha therapies.

To identify the clinical factors predicting failure or a good clinical response in the cohort of RA patients entered in the Lombardy Rheumatology Network (LORHEN) registry after 3 years of treatment with anti-TNF agents. We studied the patients who had received anti-TNF agents and been followed up for a minimum of 6 months. Disease activity at baseline and after 6 months was assessed using the DAS28, and response was evaluated according to the EULAR improvement criteria. 1005 patients (55.72 years) were included in the analysis. at baseline the DAS-28 was 5.91+/-0.95 and a HAQ score was 1.46+/-0.61. At mean of 14.57 months, 29.9% of the patients achieved a DAS-28 of <or=2.6 (remission). A higher RR for remission was associated with male gender (AHR 1.51, 95% CI 1.14-2.00; p: 0.004) and a lower RR for remission with: prior treatment with >3 DMARDs (AHR 0.077, 95% CI 0.58-1.03; p: 0.074), a high ESR (AHR 0.86, 95% CI 0.81-0.92; p: 0.000), Steinbrocker's functional class III/IV (AHR 0.66, 95% CI 0.48-0.90; p: 0.010), a high TJC (AHR 0.97, 95% CI 0.94-0.99; p: 0.011). A 12-month EULAR non-response was observed in 153/821 (18.6%) associated with a higher baseline HAQ score (AOR 1.51, 95% CI 1.03-2.20, p: 0.033), prior treatment with >3 DMARDs (AOR 1.76, 95% CI 1.09-2.85; p: 0.021) and corticosteroid >5 mg/day (AOR 2.05, 95% CI 1.06-3.97; p: 0.034). We found that only a minority of patients with long-standing RA treated with anti-TNF agents achieve a good clinical response or remission.

Anti-tumour necrosis factor (TNF) agents have revolutionized the treatment of patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA). These therapies are, however, expensive and 30% of patients fail to respond. In a large cohort of Caucasian RA patients treated with anti-TNF medications (total n = 1050, etanercept n = 455, infliximab n = 450), we investigated whether genotypes of eight single nucleotide polymorphisms in the region containing the TNF gene were associated with response to anti-TNF therapy. Linear regression analyses adjusted for baseline 28 joint disease activity score (DAS28), baseline health assessment questionnaire score, gender and concurrent disease modifying anti-rheumatic drug treatment were used to assess association of these polymorphisms with treatment response, defined by change in DAS28 after 6 months. Analyses were performed in the entire cohort, and also stratified by anti-TNF agent. Association between DAS28 response and TNF-308 (rs1800629) genotype (P = 0.001) was detected across the whole cohort. After stratification by anti-TNF agent, the rare TNF-308AA genotype was associated with a significantly poorer response compared with TNF-308GG in etanercept (P = 0.001, n = 7) but not infliximab (P = 0.8, n = 17) treated patients. Conversely, the GA genotype at TNF-238 (rs361525) was associated with a poorer response to infliximab (P = 0.028, n = 40), but not etanercept (P = 0.6, n = 33). Owing to the small numbers of patients in some of the genotype groups examined, our data must be regarded as preliminary and will require replication in further large cohorts of anti-TNF-treated patients. If confirmed, our findings suggest the potential for genotype at these markers to aid selection of anti-TNF agent in patients with RA.

Anti-TNF treatments have given patients with rheumatoid arthritis considerable hope and relief. However, 20-30% of patients do not respond sufficiently to a given anti-TNF drug. In this situation, current strategies include switching to an alternative agent, increasing the dose of the current agent or to return to conventional DMARDs. The arrival of new biologics, which target different molecules than TNF, opens the perspective to other pathways of immunomodulation in RA. These drugs include rituximab (anti-CD20), abatacept (CTLA4Ig) and tocilizumab (anti- IL6R). Comparative studies are urgently needed to assess the efficacy of the different treatment options in order to provide the best therapeutic strategy for our patients.

Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) patients with moderate disease activity show progression of joint damage and have impaired quality of life, physical function, work and daily activities. Little is known about management of patients with moderate RA. The aim of the study was to assess the 1-year response to anti-TNF in biologic-naïve RA patients with moderate (3.2 <DAS28 ≤5.1) disease activity despite DMARD treatment, in the Italian clinical practice. The MODERATE study is a multicentre prospective, cohort non-interventional study, conducted in 19 Italian rheumatology sites. Patients with moderate RA, diagnosed according to the 2010 American College of Rheumatology (ACR)/EULAR criteria, were enrolled if they also were aged ≥18 years, had disease onset after 16 years old, moderate disease at baseline (DAS28 score >3.2 and ≤5.1), and were naïve to anti-TNF treatment. Among 157 RA patients, 93 (59%) underwent etanercept, 43 (22%) adalimumab, 26 (17%) certolizumab, 10 golimumab and 2 infliximab; 80% of patients were still in treatment after 12-month observation. One-year clinical remission was achieved by 27 RA patients (21%), reduction of DAS28 score greater than 1.2 was observed in 75 (58%) patients. Moderate and good response according to EULAR criteria was observed in 59 (46%) and 45 (35%) patients, respectively. Results confirm the efficacy of anti-TNF alpha also in moderate RA patients, who may achieve a substantial decrease of disease activity, and improve their quality of life. The low rate of patients achieving remission may suggest that therapeutic strategies should be more timely and aggressive.

Anti-tumour necrosis factor (anti-TNF) therapy has proved to be highly successful in treating rheumatoid arthritis (RA), although 30-40% of patients have little or no response. The authors hypothesise that this may be genetically determined. In other complex diseases, susceptibility genes have been shown to influence treatment response. The aim of the current study was to investigate the association of markers within confirmed RA susceptibility loci with the response to anti-TNF treatment. Eighteen single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) mapping to 11 genetic loci were genotyped in 1012 patients with RA receiving treatment with etanercept, infliximab or adalimumab. Multivariate linear regression analyses were performed using the absolute change in 28 joint count disease activity score (DAS28) between baseline and 6-month follow-up as the outcome variable, adjusting for confounders. p Values <0.05 were considered statistically significant and associated markers were genotyped in an additional 322 samples. Analysis was performed in the combined cohort of 1334 subjects with RA treated with anti-TNF. In the combined analysis, SNPs mapping to AFF3 and CD226 had a statistically significant association with the response to anti-TNF treatment under an additive model. The G allele at rs10865035, mapping to AFF3, was associated with an improved response to anti-TNF treatment (coefficient -0.14 (95% CI -0.25 to -0.03), p=0.015). At the CD226 SNP rs763361, the C allele conferred reduced response to treatment (coefficient 0.11 (95% CI 0.00 to 0.22), p=0.048). These results suggest that AFF3 and CD226, two confirmed RA susceptibility genes, have an additional role in influencing the response to anti-TNF treatment.

To evaluate the effectiveness and safety of anti-tumor necrosis factor (anti-TNF) therapies in rheumatoid arthritis (RA), and to identify the factors involved in this response. Dynamic prospective cohort study of patients with RA treated with anti-TNF under clinical practice conditions. Effectiveness was evaluated using Disease Activity Score (DAS) 28, European League Against Rheumatism (EULAR) response, Health Assessment Questionnaire (HAQ), and time to treatment failure. Prior adherence was evaluated retrospectively and safety was evaluated by adverse events (AE). The analysis was restricted to anti-TNF-naive patients. The study included 161 patients treated for RA during 6 years (60 infliximab, 79 etanercept, and 22 adalimumab). At 6 months, 15% reached a good EULAR response and 38% a moderate response. A mean decrease of -1.5 (p < 0.0001) was observed in the DAS28 and of -0.34 in the HAQ (p < 0.0001); however, women showed poorer progress in terms of DAS and HAQ. In the first year, 64.3% did not experience treatment failure and this figure was 50.5% after 2 years. In one-third, glucocorticoids were withdrawn and in the remainder the dose was reduced by 50%. Adherence to treatment, selection of etanercept, and intensification of infliximab were associated with a lower probability of premature failure in the multivariate model. AE were similar to other those in studies and no outstanding differences in safety were found between the 3 anti-TNF therapies. Anti-TNF treatments are effective and safe, reducing the activity of the disease, disability, and the need for corticosteroids. Patients who displayed good adherence prior to the anti-TNF treatment and were treated with etanercept or with increasing doses of infliximab had the best chance of displaying a response.

Most composite indices of disease activity and response criteria in RA have been validated and compared in clinical trials rather than routine care. We therefore wanted to compare the performance of the DAS28, SDAI and CDAI activity indices, their activity states, their response criteria, and also compare with the ACR response criteria in an observational clinical setting. Agreement between the criteria sets was investigated using kappa statistics in a non-randomized cohort of 1789 RA patients from southern Sweden, starting their first course of anti-TNF-treatment. Mean disease duration was 12 years. Completer analysis was used. Agreement between high, moderate and low activity states was moderate or substantial, with kappa = 0.5 or better for all criteria. Agreement between SDAI and CDAI disease states was > 90% in these categories with kappa > 0.8. DAS28 original and modified cut point remission had good agreement (kappa = 0.91). Agreement between responses was substantial at the overall/ACR20 level (about 95%, kappa = 0.7 or better) for all criteria. By contrast, agreement was poor between moderate and high level responses. Disease activity states according to the various indices perform similarly and show substantial agreement at all levels except remission. Agreement between SDAI and CDAI states is excellent. Response criteria, applied at the individual patient level, are hard to interpret and show poor agreement, except at the lowest level of response. Thus, they should not be applied uncritically in clinical practice.

Approximately 30% of rheumatoid arthritis patients achieve inadequate response to anti-TNF biologics. Attempts to identify molecular biomarkers predicting response have met with mixed success. This may be attributable, in part, to the variable and subjective disease assessment endpoints with large placebo effects typically used to classify patient response. Sixty-one patients with active RA despite methotrexate treatment, and with MRI-documented synovitis, were randomized to receive infliximab or placebo. Blood was collected at baseline and genome-wide transcription in whole blood was measured using microarrays. The primary endpoint in this study was determined by measuring the transfer rate constant (Ktrans) of a gadolinium-based contrast agent from plasma to synovium using MRI. Secondary endpoints included repeated clinical assessments with DAS28(CRP), and assessments of osteitis and synovitis by the RAMRIS method. Infliximab showed greater decrease from baseline in DCE-MRI Ktrans of wrist and MCP at all visits compared with placebo (P<0.001). Statistical analysis was performed to identify genes associated with treatment-specific 14-week change in Ktrans. The 256 genes identified were used to derive a gene signature score by averaging their log expression within each patient. The resulting score correlated with improvement of Ktrans in infliximab-treated patients and with deterioration of Ktrans in placebo-treated subjects. Poor responders showed high expression of activated B-cell genes whereas good responders exhibited a gene expression pattern consistent with mobilization of neutrophils and monocytes and high levels of reticulated platelets. This gene signature was significantly associated with clinical response in two previously published whole blood gene expression studies using anti-TNF therapies. These data provide support for the hypothesis that anti-TNF inadequate responders comprise a distinct molecular subtype of RA characterized by differences in pre-treatment blood mRNA expression. They also highlight the importance of placebo controls and robust, objective endpoints in biomarker discovery. ClinicalTrials.gov NCT01313520.

Identifying early predictors of response to biological agents is important for both the individual patient and health economics. The aim here was to identify clinical variables that are easily assessed in clinical practice which are associated with a major response to rituximab (moderate to good EULAR response, according to DAS28 values) in patients with active rheumatoid arthritis and inadequate response to anti-TNF agents or traditional DMARDs. Rituximab (2x1g, two weeks apart) was administered to 108 patients in four different Spanish hospitals. The primary efficacy endpoint was the percentage of patients who achieved a major response at six months. Potential predictors of a major response were identified using multivariate binary logistic regression models. At six months of treatment 75.9% of patients achieved a major response (24% good and 52% moderate). Comparing the clinical features at baseline between patients who did or did not achieve a major response, significant differences were found in rheumatoid factor (RF) and anti-CCP positivity, as well as in the number of failed anti-TNF agents prior to rituximab. While rituximab delivers clinical benefit in seronegative patients, the presence of RF and/or anti-CCP consistently enriches clinical responses. The multivariate analysis showed that the best model for predicting a major EULAR response to rituximab was comprised of the following two variables: the anti-CCP antibody positivity (p=0.045) and the number of previous anti-TNF agents used (p=0.028). Using a cut-off level for CCP of 300 U/ml we found that patients with an anti-CCP titre >300 U/ml were 3-4 times more likely to achieve a major EULAR response [odds ratio (OR): 3.38; 95% CI: 1.025-11.17]. By contrast, those patients who had failed to respond to 2 or more anti-TNF agents had a 72.5% lower probability of achieving a moderate to good EULAR response (OR: 0.275; 95% CI: 0.087-0.871) than did patients who had only failed to respond to one such agent. A lower number of previously-failed TNF blockers and high anti-CCP titre can help select the best candidates for RTX therapy in patients with RA.

Although anti-TNF drugs have changed the clinical course of rheumatoid arthritis (RA), survival rates and resistance-to-therapy data confirm that about 30% of RA patients fail to respond. The aim of this study was to evaluate the correlations between the development of antidrug antibodies, specific IgG4 antibodies against TNF inhibitors, and resistance to therapy in RA patients. This retrospective study involved 129 patients with established RA naïve to biological agents (98 females and 32 males, mean age 56.7±12.3 years, disease duration 6.3±1.2 years, baseline Disease Activity Score [DAS]-28 3.2-5.6) who received treatment with anti-TNF agents after the failure of conventional disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs (32 received infliximab [IFX], 58 etanercept [ETN], and 39 adalimumab [ADA]). After 6 months of treatment, the patients were classified as being in remission (DAS28 <2.6), having low disease activity (LDA; DAS28 2.6-3.2), or not responding (NR: DAS28 >3.2). The patients were also tested for serum antidrug antibodies and IgG4 antibodies against TNF inhibitors. After 24 weeks of treatment, 38% of the ETN-treated patients and 28% of those treated with ADA had injection-site reactions; the rate of systemic reactions in the IFX group was 25%. The differences among the three groups were not statistically significant (P=0.382; ETN versus ADA P=0.319). The percentages of patients with adverse events stratified by drug response were: LDA 8% and NR 18% in the ADA group; in remission 3%, LDA 22%, and NR 10% in the ETN group; and LDA 6% and NR 16% in the IFX group (P=0.051). The percentages of patients with antidrug antibodies were: ADA 33.3%, ETN 11.5%, and IFX 10.3% (P=0.025; ADA versus ETN P=0.015). The percentages of patients with IgG4 antibodies were: ADA 6%, ETN 13%, and IFX 26% (P=0.017; ADA versus ETN P=0.437). Associations between antidrug antibodies, specific IgG4 antibodies, and adverse reactions were not significant for any of the three drugs. IgG4 levels were higher in the ADA group than in the other two groups, and higher in the patients with worse DAS28 (NR) and in those experiencing adverse events. These data suggest a possible association between IgG4 levels and worse DAS28 (r (2)=5.8%, P=0.011). The presence of specific IgG4 antibodies against TNF blockers in patients with RA might affect the drugs' activity. Patients with injection-site reactions and IgG4 against ETN may show a decreased response.

Although TNF inhibitors have dramatically improved the outcome of patients with rheumatoid arthritis, 30-40% of patients do not respond well to them and treatment needs to be changed. In an effort to discriminate good and poor responders, we focused on the change in serum and synovial fluid levels of interleukin (IL-) 33 before and after treatment with TNF inhibitors. They were also measured in synovial fluids from 17 TNF inhibitor-naïve patients, and fibroblast-like synoviocytes (FLS) in-culture from 6 patients and correlated with various pro-inflammatory cytokines. Serum levels of IL-33 at 6 months after treatment decreased significantly in responders, while they did not change in non-responders. Synovial fluid levels of IL-33 in 6 patients under treatment with TNF inhibitors stayed high in 3 who were refractory and slightly elevated in 2 moderate responders, while they were undetectable in one patient under remission. Among inflammatory cytokines measured in 17 synovial fluids from TNF inhibitor-naïve patients, levels of IL-33 showed a significant positive correlation only to those of IL-1β. IL-1β increased IL-33 expression markedly in FLS in vitro, compared to TNF-α. IL-1β might be inducing RA inflammation through producing pro-inflammatory IL-33 in TNF inhibitor-hypo-responders. Sustained elevation of serum and/or synovial levels of IL-33 may account for a poor response to TNF inhibitors, although how TNF inhibitors affect the level of IL-33 remains to be elucidated.
