In most epithelial tissues Cl(-) transport relies on the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) which has dual function as a Cl(-) channel and as a regulator of other ion channels. More than 900 different mutations in the CFTR gene are the cause for defective transport of Cl(-) and Na(+) and impaired secretion or absorption of electrolytes in cystic fibrosis. However, the CFTR mutation delta F508 is the most common reason for the frequently inherited disease among the Caucasian population. Maturation and processing of delta F508-CFTR is defective which leads to expression of only very little but functional CFTR in the cell membrane. Understanding the processing and trafficking of CFTR may give a clue to the question as to how the expression and residual function of delta F508-CFTR can be enhanced, and may lead to the development of new pharmacological tools for the treatment of cystic fibrosis.

The generalized exocrinopathy cystic fibrosis (CF) is the most common severe genetic disease in Caucasian populations. A panel of more than 700 chromosomes from German and Turkish CF patients was screened for disease-causing mutations in the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) gene by chemical cleavage of mismatch, single strand conformation polymorphism, restriction analysis and direct sequencing of genomic DNA amplified by polymerase chain reaction. Besides the major 3-bp deletion, delta F508 that was found on 73% of German CF chromosomes, more than 50 other missense, nonsense, frame-shift, and splice-site mutations have already been identified. In general, a CFTR mutation is linked with a single 10-marker haplotype which indicates that in most cases a particular mutation spread from a common ancestor. The comparison of mutation genotypes with the disease phenotype emphasized the causative role of the type and localization of the CFTR mutation for clinical course and prognosis. Pancreatic status and the risk of colonization of airways with opportunistic pathogens are genetically determined. Most patients who are harbouring mutations in the nucleotide binding folds were suffering from severe CF disease. Mild or even aberrant forms of CF were observed for many missense mutations located in the putative transmembrane domains or for mutations that are expected to result in a truncated protein of half of wild-type CFTR.

To determine the nature and frequency of non-delta F508 cystic fibrosis (CF) mutations among diverse populations, we have sequenced exons 9-12 and 19-23 of the CF transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) gene from 128 CF chromosomes (39 U.S. Caucasian, 27 African-American, 42 Northern Irish, and 20 Israeli chromosomes). These regions were chosen because they encode the two putative ATP-binding folds of CFTR, domains which appear to have functional significance. In addition, CFTR exons 1 and 2 were analyzed in the American patients. Mutations were found on 49 of the 128 CF chromosomes. Nineteen different mutations were observed; six were novel, while the remaining 13 had been reported previously by our group or by other investigators. Six of nine different mutations found in African-American patients were unique to that population. However, the vast majority of the mutations found in U.S. Caucasians (eight of nine), Northern Irish (four of five), and Israelis (three of three) also occurred in other Caucasian groups. The preponderance of previously reported mutations in these three groups suggested that a subset of the non-delta F508 mutations occur in common among Caucasians. A survey of mutation frequencies in other Caucasian groups confirmed this observation. Unfortunately, this subset accounts for less than half of non-delta F508 CF mutations in most groups. These data suggest that screening for delta F508 and this select group of mutations will efficiently and economically maximize the number of CF mutations identified in Caucasian groups. However, it will be difficult to detect more than 90% of mutant CFTR alleles except in ethnically and geographically discrete populations where CF is the result of founder effect.

Alveolar macrophages (AMs) play a major role in host defense against microbial infections in the lung. To perform this function, these cells must ingest and destroy pathogens, generally in phagosomes, as well as secrete a number of products that signal other immune cells to respond. Recently, we demonstrated that murine alveolar macrophages employ the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) Cl(-) channel as a determinant in lysosomal acidification (Di, A., Brown, M. E., Deriy, L. V., Li, C., Szeto, F. L., Chen, Y., Huang, P., Tong, J., Naren, A. P., Bindokas, V., Palfrey, H. C., and Nelson, D. J. (2006) Nat. Cell Biol. 8, 933-944). Lysosomes and phagosomes in murine cftr(-/-) AMs failed to acidify, and the cells were deficient in bacterial killing compared with wild type controls. Cystic fibrosis is caused by mutations in CFTR and is characterized by chronic lung infections. The information about relationships between the CFTR genotype and the disease phenotype is scarce both on the organismal and cellular level. The most common disease-causing mutation, DeltaF508, is found in 70% of patients with cystic fibrosis. The mutant protein fails to fold properly and is targeted for proteosomal degradation. G551D, the second most common mutation, causes loss of function of the protein at the plasma membrane. In this study, we have investigated the impact of CFTR DeltaF508 and G551D on a set of core intracellular functions, including organellar acidification, granule secretion, and microbicidal activity in the AM. Utilizing primary AMs from wild type, cftr(-/-), as well as mutant mice, we show a tight correlation between CFTR genotype and levels of lysosomal acidification, bacterial killing, and agonist-induced secretory responses, all of which would be expected to contribute to a significant impact on microbial clearance in the lung.

Cystic fibrosis (CF) is a common genetic disorder in the Caucasian population. The gene was identified in 1989 on the basis of its map location on chromosome 7. The encoded gene product, named cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR), corresponds to a cAMP-regulated chloride channel found almost exclusively in the secretory epithelial cells. Although the major mutation that results in a single amino acid deletion (F508) accounts for 70% of the disease alleles, more than 550 additional mutant alleles of different forms have been detected. Many of these mutations can be divided into five general classes in terms of their demonstrated or presumed molecular consequences. In addition, a good correlation has been found between CFTR genotype and one of the clinical variables--pancreatic function status. An unexpected finding, however, is the documentation of CFTR mutations in patients with atypical CF disease presentations, including congenital absence of vas deferens and several pulmonary diseases. Thus, the implication of CFTR mutation is more profound than CF alone.

Cigarette smoking causes Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD), the 3rd leading cause of death in the U.S. CFTR ion transport dysfunction has been implicated in COPD pathogenesis, and is associated with chronic bronchitis. However, susceptibility to smoke induced lung injury is variable and the underlying genetic contributors remain unclear. We hypothesized that presence of CFTR mutation heterozygosity may alter susceptibility to cigarette smoke induced CFTR dysfunction. Consequently, COPD patients with chronic bronchitis may have a higher rate of CFTR mutations compared to the general population. Primary human bronchial epithelial cells derived from F508del CFTR heterozygotes and mice with (CFTR+/-) and without (CFTR+/+) CFTR heterozygosity were exposed to whole cigarette smoke (WCS); CFTR-dependent ion transport was assessed by Ussing chamber electrophysiology and nasal potential difference measurements, respectively. Caucasians with COPD and chronic bronchitis, age 40 to 80 with FEV1/FVC < 0.70 and FEV1 < 60% predicted, were selected for genetic analysis from participants in the NIH COPD Clinical Research Network's Azithromycin for Prevention of Exacerbations of COPD in comparison to 32,900 Caucasian women who underwent prenatal genetic testing. Genetic analysis involved an allele-specific genotyping of 89 CFTR mutations. Exposure to WCS caused a pronounced reduction in CFTR activity in both CFTR (+/+) cells and F508del CFTR (+/-) cells; however, neither the degree of decrement (44.7% wild-type vs. 53.5% F508del heterozygous, P = NS) nor the residual CFTR activity were altered by CFTR heterozygosity. Similarly, WCS caused a marked reduction in CFTR activity measured by NPD in both wild type and CFTR heterozygous mice, but the severity of decrement (91.1% wild type vs. 47.7% CF heterozygous, P = NS) and the residual activity were not significantly affected by CFTR genetic status. Five of 127 (3.9%) COPD patients with chronic bronchitis were heterozygous for CFTR mutations which was not significantly different from controls (4.5%) (P = NS). The magnitude of WCS induced reductions in CFTR activity was not affected by the presence of CFTR mutation heterozygosity. CFTR mutations do not increase the risk of COPD with chronic bronchitis. CFTR dysfunction due to smoking is primarily an acquired phenomenon and is not affected by the presence of congenital CFTR mutations.

Cystic fibrosis is the most common inherited lethal disease in Caucasians. It is caused by mutations in the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR), of which the cftr ΔF508 mutation is the most common. ΔF508 macrophages are intrinsically defective in autophagy because of the sequestration of essential autophagy molecules within unprocessed CFTR aggregates. Defective autophagy allows Burkholderia cenocepacia (B. cepacia) to survive and replicate in ΔF508 macrophages. Infection by B. cepacia poses a great risk to cystic fibrosis patients because it causes accelerated lung inflammation and, in some cases, a lethal necrotizing pneumonia. Autophagy is a cell survival mechanism whereby an autophagosome engulfs non-functional organelles and delivers them to the lysosome for degradation. The ubiquitin binding adaptor protein SQSTM1/p62 is required for the delivery of several ubiquitinated cargos to the autophagosome. In WT macrophages, p62 depletion and overexpression lead to increased and decreased bacterial intracellular survival, respectively. In contrast, depletion of p62 in ΔF508 macrophages results in decreased bacterial survival, whereas overexpression of p62 leads to increased B. cepacia intracellular growth. Interestingly, the depletion of p62 from ΔF508 macrophages results in the release of the autophagy molecule beclin1 (BECN1) from the mutant CFTR aggregates and allows its redistribution and recruitment to the B. cepacia vacuole, mediating the acquisition of the autophagy marker LC3 and bacterial clearance via autophagy. These data demonstrate that p62 differentially dictates the fate of B. cepacia infection in WT and ΔF508 macrophages.

Numerous studies have reported CFTR mutations in CBAVD (congenital bilateral absence of the vas deferens) patients, but their results are not completely consistent. Here, we present a systemic review and meta-analysis with emphasis on clarifying further the genetic association of CFTR mutations with CBAVD. We searched the MEDLINE database until March, 2011 for eligible articles reporting CFTR mutations in CBAVD. Relevant data from each included study were abstracted by two independent reviewers. The overall frequency of CFTR mutations in CBAVD and the odds ratio (OR) for common specific alleles were pooled under random-effect or fixed-effect model as appropriate. Subgroup analysis was performed by ethnicity, and potential heterogeneity and bias were both assessed. Among CBAVD patients, 78% had at least one CFTR mutation, 46% having two and 28% only one. Moreover, the common heterozygous F508del/5T and F508del/R117H were observed in 17 and 4% of CBAVD cases respectively, and the allele frequency in CBAVD was 17% for F508del, 25% for 5T and 3% for R117H. Subgroup analysis indicated an increased frequency of cases with two mutations in Caucasian patients than in Non-Caucasian (68 versus 50%, P= 0.012), but no differences for cases with at least one mutation (88 versus 77%, P= 0.163) or with only one mutation (17 versus 25%, P= 0.115). Caucasian patients had higher F508del frequency, but lower 5T frequency, than Non-Caucasian (22 versus 8%, P= 0.001; 20 versus 31%, P= 0.009). Summary OR was 9.25 for 5T [95% confidence interval (CI) 7.07-12.11, P= 0.000], with moderate heterogeneity (I(2)= 49.20%, P= 0.019) and evident bias (Egger's test, P= 0.005), and it was 19.43 for 5T/(TG)12_13 (95% CI 10.48-30.03, P= 0.000) without any evidence of heterogeneity (I(2)= 0.1%, P= 0.391) and bias (Egger's test, P= 0.160). The OR for 5T/(TG)12_13 was significantly higher than that for 5T allele (P= 0.000). In summary, our results demonstrate a high frequency of CFTR mutations in CBAVD patients, and these exhibit evident ethnic differences. In addition, 5T allele and 5T/(TG)12_13 may contribute to the increased risk for CBAVD, with the 5T penetrance probably being modulated by adjacent (TG)12_13.

The objective was to determine the composition of the Cystic Fibrosis (CF) Population attending specialist UK CF centres in terms of age, gender, age at diagnosis, genotype and ethnicity. With the planned introduction of the national CF screening programme in the UK, cystic fibrosis transmembrane regulator (CFTR) mutations were compared between different ethnic groups enabling a UK-specific frequency of mutations to be defined. Data were analysed from the patient biographies held in the UK CF Database (see www.cystic-fibrosis.org.uk). The currently registered population of 5,274 CF patients is 96.3% Caucasian with a male preponderance that significantly increases with age. The majority of the 196 non-Caucasian CF patients are from the Indian Subcontinent (ISC), of which one in 84 UK CF patients are of Pakistani origin. The commonest CFTR mutation, deltaF508, is found in 74.1% of all CF chromosomes. In the Caucasian CF population, 57.5% are deltaF508 homozygotes but the UK ISC CF population with only 24.7%, has significantly fewer deltaF508 homozygotes patients (95% confidence interval (CI) 0.2-0.4). The distribution of Caucasian patients with deltaF508/deltaF508, deltaF508/Other and Other/Other does not fit the expected distribution with a Hardy-Weinberg model unless those patients without a detected mutation are excluded (P<0.001). The UK CF Database has shown the UK CF population to have distinct characteristics separate from the North American and European CF Registries. The ISC group contains many mutations not recognised by current genetic analysis, and one in four ISC patients have no CFTR mutations identified. The CFTR analysis proposed for the screening programme would detect 96% of patients registered in the database, but is unlikely to achieve the desired >80% detection rates in the ethnic minority groups. Screen-positive, non-Caucasian infants without an identifiable CFTR mutation should be referred for a sweat test and genetic counselling when serum trypsinogen concentrations remain elevated after birth.

Cystic fibrosis (CF) is the most common inherited disorder in Caucasian populations, with over 1400 mutations identified in the Cystic Fibrosis Transmembrane conductance Regulator (CFTR) gene. Mutations in the CFTR gene may be also causative for CBAVD (Congenital Bilateral Absence of the Vas Deferens). The type and distribution of mutations varies widely between different countries and/or ethnic groups, and is relatively unknown in Iran. We therefore performed a comprehensive analysis of the CFTR gene in Iranian CF patients. 69 Iranian CF patients, and 1 CBAVD patient, were analysed for mutations in the complete coding region, and its exon/intron junctions, of their CFTR genes, using different methods, such as ARMS (amplification refractory mutation system)-PCR, SSCP (single stranded conformation polymorphism) analysis, restriction enzyme digestion analysis, direct sequencing, and MLPA (Multiplex Ligation-mediated Probe Amplification). CFTR mutation analysis revealed the identification of 37 mutations in 69 Iranian CF patients. Overall, 81.9% (113/138) CFTR genes derived from Iranian CF patients could be characterized for a disease-causing mutation. The CBAVD patient was found to be homozygous for the p.W1145R mutation. The most common mutations were p.F508del (DeltaF508) (18.1%), c.2183_2184delAAinsG (2183AA>G) (6.5%), p.S466X (5.8%), p.N1303K (4.3%), c.2789+5G>A (4.3%), p.G542X (3.6%), c.3120+1G>A (3.6%), p.R334W (2.9%) and c.3130delA (2.9%). These 9 types of mutant CFTR genes totaled for 52% of all CFTR genes derived from the 69 Iranian CF patients. Eight mutations, c.406-8T>C, p.A566D, c.2576delA, c.2752-1_2756delGGTGGCinsTTG, p.T1036I, p.W1145R, c.3850-24G>A, c.1342-?_1524+?del, were found for the first time in this study. We identified 37 CFTR mutations in 69 well characterized Iranian CF patients, obtaining a CFTR mutation detection rate of 81.9%, the highest detection rate obtained in the Iranian population so far. These findings will assist in genetic counseling, prenatal diagnosis and future screening of CF in Iran.
