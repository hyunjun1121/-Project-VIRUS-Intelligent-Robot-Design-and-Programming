Short-QT syndrome is an inherited disorder characterized by a short QT interval and an increased risk of sudden cardiac death. The clinical significance of a short QT interval observed in a randomly recorded ECG is not known. Therefore, we assessed the prevalence and prognostic significance of a short QT interval in a general population. QT intervals were measured from the 12-lead ECGs of 10 822 randomly selected middle-aged subjects (5658 males, mean age 44+/-8.4 years) enrolled in a population study and followed up for 29+/-10 years. The end points were all-cause and cardiovascular mortality. In addition to Bazett's method (corrected QT interval, or QTc), the Fridericia (QTfc) and nomogram (QTnc) methods were used to correct the QT interval for heart rate. The cutoff values for short QT intervals were defined as 320 ms (very short) and 340 ms (short). The prevalence of QT interval <320 ms based on QTc, QTfc, and QTnc was 0.10%, 0.08%, and 0.06%, and the prevalence of QT interval <340 ms was 0.4%, 0.3%, and 0.3%, respectively. The majority of subjects with short QT intervals were males. All-cause or cardiovascular mortality did not differ between subjects with a very short or short QT interval and those with normal QT intervals (360 to 450 ms). There were no sudden cardiac deaths, aborted sudden cardiac deaths, or documented ventricular tachyarrhythmias among subjects with a QTfc <340 ms. A short QT interval does not appear to indicate an increased risk for all-cause or cardiovascular mortality in middle-aged nonreferral, community-based individuals.

The epidemiology of short QT interval remains unclear. We attempted to determine the incidence and clinical characteristics of short QT interval in a longitudinal cohort study. A total of 19,153 subjects (7,525 male, 11,628 female) were enrolled in the study and all available electrocardiograms (ECGs) were investigated longitudinally from 1958 through 2003. We defined short QT interval as QTc of less than 350 ms. Of the 19,153 subjects, two met the criteria of short QT interval and allowed for prevalence and incidence estimates for short QT interval as 0.01% and 0.39/100,000 person-years, respectively. Both cases had neither a family history of sudden cardiac death, nor a history of drug use that might have affected for QT interval. Case 1 was a female with history of ischemic heart disease. Case 2 was a 60-year-old male who exhibited a short QT interval for the first time when he was 26 years of age. He had sick sinus syndrome as an underlying heart disease. Of the 19,153 subjects in this study, none were identified as having the short QT syndrome, with associated high risk of ventricular tachyarrhythmia, atrial fibrillation, and sudden death. Two subjects were identified as having QTc of less than 350 ms, and allowed prevalence and incidence estimates to be made of short QT interval. There observations were suggestive of clinical relationships between short QT interval and organic or electrophysiological heart disease.

Long QT syndrome causes ventricular tachyarrhythmias and sudden death. Recently, a short QT interval has also been shown to be associated with an increased risk of tachyarrhythmia and sudden death. However, the prevalence of short QT syndrome is not well-known. The aim of this study was to assess the distribution of corrected QT intervals (QTc) and prevalence of short QT syndrome. This study comprised 12,149 consecutive subjects who received a consultation at Kanazawa University Hospital, Kanazawa, Japan, and had an electrocardiogram (ECG) between February 2003 and May 2004. Of these subjects, 1,165 subjects were excluded because of inappropriate ECGs, while the remaining 10,984 subjects had their last-recorded ECGs analyzed. The QTc values showed a nearly normal distribution (408 +/- 25 msec(1/2)), and were significantly longer in females (412 +/- 24 msec(1/2)) than in males (404 +/- 25 msec(1/2)) (p < 0.05). Among 5,511 males, 69 subjects (1.25%) exhibited QTc < 354 msec(1/2) (2 standard deviations [SDs] below the mean in males), and among 5,473 females, 89 subjects (1.63%) exhibited QTc < 364 msec(1/2) (2 SDs below the mean in females). Only 3 subjects (0.03% in all subjects and 0.05% in males) exhibited QTc < 300 msec(1/2), however, none had clinical symptoms of short QT syndrome. Short QT syndrome may be very rare.

Abnormally long and short QT intervals are recognized to be associated with an increased risk for life-threatening ventricular arrhythmias. It is therefore important to define the upper and lower border of the normal QT. The aim of this study was to describe the normal distribution of the QT interval in a contemporary population of young conscripts and to define long and short limits of the QT interval. In Switzerland, all young male citizens must undergo compulsory conscription for the Swiss Army at the age of 18 to 19 years. In every conscript, an electrocardiogram (ECG) is performed. Retrospectively, 41,767 consecutive ECGs of Swiss citizens who underwent conscription for the army between March 1, 2004, and July 31, 2006, were analyzed. The mean QTc Bazett interval was 394 +/- 22 ms. One percent of the conscripts had a Bazett QTc shorter than 347 ms, and one percent had a Bazett QTc longer than 445 ms, respectively. None of the subjects presented a QTc Bazett < 300 ms; the prevalence of a QTc Bazett < 320 ms was 0.02%. The present study shows the distribution of QT intervals in an unselected young population. Because none of the subjects presented a QTc < 300 ms, it may be concluded that the short QT syndrome is a very rare entity in the population of young male adults.

Short QT syndrome is one of the underlying disorders associated with ventricular fibrillation. However, the precise prognostic implication of a short QT interval remains unclear. The purpose of this study was to investigate the prevalence and long-term prognosis in patients with a shorter-than-normal QT interval in a large hospital-based population. We chose patients with a short Bazett QTc interval from a database consisting of 114,334 patients to determine the clinical characteristics and prognostic value of a short QT interval. A total of 427 patients (mean age 43.4 ± 22.4 years) had a short QT interval with about a 1.2 times higher male predominance (234 men). The QTc interval was significantly longer in female than in male patients (363.8 ± 6.1 ms vs 357.1 ± 5.8 ms, P <.0001). The age-specific prevalence of patients with short QT interval was biphasic, peaking at young and old age. Atrial fibrillation and early repolarization were complicated with short QT interval in 39 (9.1%) and 26 (6.1%) patients, respectively. The prognosis of 327 patients (182 men; mean age, 46.4 ± 27.3 years) with a short QT interval could be assessed (mean follow-up period, 54.0 ± 62.0 months). During the follow-up, 2 patients, 1 of whom had early repolarization, developed life-threatening events, in contrast to 6 patients who died of noncardiac causes and did not have early repolarization. The prevalence of a short QT interval showed a slight male preponderance and biphasic age-dependent distribution in both genders. The complication rate of atrial fibrillation was higher in those with a short QT interval than in general populations. The long-term outcome suggested that early repolarization in a short QT interval might be associated with potential risk of lethal arrhythmia.
