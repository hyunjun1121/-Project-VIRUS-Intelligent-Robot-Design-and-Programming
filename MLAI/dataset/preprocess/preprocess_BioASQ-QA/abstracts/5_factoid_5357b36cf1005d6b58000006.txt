Checkpoint kinase 2 (CHEK2, Chk2) emerges as an important signal transducer of cellular responses to DNA damage and a candidate tumor suppressor whose defects contribute to molecular pathogenesis of diverse types of human malignancies, both sporadic and hereditary. Here, we briefly outline the molecular properties, regulation and physiological role of CHEK2, and review in more detail its defects that predispose to tumors, with particular emphasis on familial breast cancer. The frequency, penetrance and epidemiological as well as clinical significance of the two most studied breast cancer-predisposing variants of the CHEK2 gene, 1100delC and I157T, are highlighted in more depth, and additional CHEK2 mutations and their cancer relevance are discussed as well. These recent findings are considered also from a broader perspective of CHEK2 as the integral component of the ataxia telangiectasia-mutated-CHEK2-p53 pathway within the genome integrity maintenance system and a barrier against tumor progression. Finally, the potential value of information about the CHEK2 status in family counseling and optimizition of individualized cancer treatment is discussed.

The CHEK2-1100delC mutation is recurrent in the population and is a moderate risk factor for breast cancer. To identify additional CHEK2 mutations potentially contributing to breast cancer susceptibility, we sequenced 248 cases with early-onset disease; functionally characterized new variants and conducted a population-based case-control analysis to evaluate their contribution to breast cancer risk. We identified 1 additional null mutation and 5 missense variants in the germline of cancer patients. In vitro, the CHEK2-H143Y variant resulted in gross protein destabilization, while others had variable suppression of in vitro kinase activity using BRCA1 as a substrate. The germline CHEK2-1100delC mutation was present among 8/1,646 (0.5%) sporadic, 2/400 (0.5%) early-onset and 3/302 (1%) familial breast cancer cases, but undetectable amongst 2,105 multiethnic controls, including 633 from the US. CHEK2-positive breast cancer families also carried a deleterious BRCA1 mutation. 1100delC appears to be the only recurrent CHEK2 mutation associated with a potentially significant contribution to breast cancer risk in the general population. Another recurrent mutation with attenuated in vitro function, CHEK2-P85L, is not associated with increased breast cancer susceptibility, but exhibits a striking difference in frequency across populations with different ancestral histories. These observations illustrate the importance of genotyping ethnically diverse groups when assessing the impact of low-penetrance susceptibility alleles on population risk. Our findings highlight the notion that clinical testing for rare missense mutations within CHEK2 may have limited value in predicting breast cancer risk, but that testing for the 1100delC variant may be valuable in phenotypically- and geographically-selected populations.

We recently reported that a sequence variant in the cell-cycle-checkpoint kinase CHEK2 (CHEK2 1100delC) is a low-penetrance breast cancer-susceptibility allele in noncarriers of BRCA1 or BRCA2 mutations. To investigate whether other CHEK2 variants confer susceptibility to breast cancer, we screened the full CHEK2 coding sequence in BRCA1/2-negative breast cancer cases from 89 pedigrees with three or more cases of breast cancer. We identified one novel germline variant, R117G, in two separate families. To evaluate the possible association of R117G and two germline variants reported elsewhere, R145W and I157T with breast cancer, we screened 737 BRCA1/2-negative familial breast cancer cases from 605 families, 459 BRCA1/2-positive cases from 335 families, and 723 controls from the United Kingdom, the Netherlands, and North America. All three variants were rare in all groups, and none occurred at significantly elevated frequency in familial breast cancer cases compared with controls. These results indicate that 1100delC may be the only CHEK2 allele that makes an appreciable contribution to breast cancer susceptibility.

Searching for low-penetrance genes involved in breast cancer susceptibility has been a field of interest in the last few years. Recently, the CHEK 2 gene, involved in DNA damage and replication checkpoints, has been pointed out as a good candidate; moreover, a specific variant in this gene,1100delC, has been found to increase breast cancer susceptibility among familial breast cancer cases not attributable to mutations in BRCA1 or BRCA2 genes. In our present study, we evaluated the role of the 1100delC variant as a susceptibility allele in breast cancer in the Spanish population. However, our results suggest that this variant is absent or very infrequent in our population, making its screening irrelevant from the practical point of view.

It has been proposed that rare variants within the double strand break repair genes CHEK2, BRIP1 and PALB2 predispose to breast cancer. The aim of this study was to evaluate the prevalence of these variants in an Irish breast cancer cohort and determine their contribution to the development of breast cancer in the west of Ireland. We evaluated the presence of CHEK2_1100delC variant in 903 breast cancer cases and 1,016 controls. Six previously described variants within BRIP1 and five within PALB2 were screened in 192 patients with early-onset or familial breast cancer. Where a variant was evident, it was then examined in the remainder of our 711 unselected breast cancer cases. CHEK2_1100delC was found in 5/903 (0.5%) breast cancer cases compared to 1/1016 (0.1%) controls. One mutation at BRIP1 (2392 C>T) was identified in the early-onset/familial cohort. Examination of this variant in the remainder of our cohort (711 cases) failed to identify any additional cases. None of the previously described PALB2 variants were demonstrated in the early-onset/familial cohort. We show evidence of CHEK2_1100delC and BRIP1 2392 C>T within the Irish population. CHEK2_1100delC and BRIP1 mutations incidence in Ireland is similar to that found in other unselected breast cancer cohorts from northern European countries. We found no evidence to suggest that PALB2 mutation is an important breast cancer predisposition gene in this population.
