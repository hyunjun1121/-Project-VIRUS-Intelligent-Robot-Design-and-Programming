<i>Background and Objectives:</i> Severe, recalcitrant cases of pediatric psoriasis or atopic dermatitis may necessitate treatment with biological agents; however, this may be difficult due to lack of treatment options and standardized treatment guidelines. This review evaluates the biological treatment options available, including off-label uses, and provides a basic therapeutic guideline for pediatric psoriasis and atopic dermatitis. <i>Materials and Methods:</i> A PubMed review of biological treatments for pediatric psoriasis and atopic dermatitis with information regarding age, efficacy, dosing, contra-indications, adverse events, and off-label treatments. <i>Results:</i> Currently there are three European Medicines Agency (EMA)-approved biological treatment options for pediatric psoriasis: etanercept, ustekinumab, and adalimumab. While dupilumab was recently Food and Drug Administration (FDA)- and EMA-approved for adult atopic dermatitis, it is still not yet approved for pediatric atopic dermatitis. <i>Conclusions:</i> Given the high morbidity associated with pediatric atopic dermatitis and psoriasis, there is a need for more treatment options. Further research and post-marketing registries are needed to extend the use of biologics into pediatric patients.

Efavirenz is a non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor used as first-line therapy for the treatment of HIV infection. Cytochrome P450 (CYP) CYP2B6 G516T (rs3745274) is a well-known predictor of efavirenz disposition. Dose adjustment based on G516T variant has been shown to be beneficial. However, this variant cannot explain the entire variability of efavirenz pharmacokinetics. In this study, we evaluated the influence of 11 single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in CYP2B6, CYP2A6, CYP3A and ABCB1 (ATP-binding cassette sub-family B member 1) on the pharmacokinetics and safety of efavirenz after single oral dose administration to 47 healthy volunteers. We designed and validated a CYP2B6 activity score model based on two CYP2B6 SNPs (G516T and rs4803419) that predicted efavirenz disposition better than G516T alone.
