Three groups have previously performed genome scans in attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD); linkage to chromosome 5p13 was detected in all of the respective studies. In the current study, we performed a whole-genome scan with 102 German families with two or more offspring who currently fulfilled the diagnostic criteria for ADHD. Including subsequent fine mapping on chromosome 5p, a total of 523 markers were genotyped. The highest nonparametric multipoint LOD score of 2.59 (empirical genome-wide significance 0.1) was obtained for chromosome 5p at 17 cM (according to the Marshfield map). Subsequent analyses revealed (a) a higher LOD score of 3.37 at 39 cM for a quantitative severity score based on symptoms of inattention than for hyperactivity/impulsivity (LOD score of 1.11 at 59 cM), and (b) an HLOD of 4.75 (empirical genome-wide significance 0.001) based on a parametric model assuming dominant inheritance. The locus of the solute carrier 6A3 (SLC6A3; dopamine transporter 1; DAT1) localizes to 5p15.33; the gene has repeatedly been implicated in the etiology of ADHD. However, in our sample the DAT1 VNTR did not show association with ADHD. We additionally identified nominal evidence for linkage to chromosomes 6q, 7p, 9q, 11 q, 12q and 17p, which had also been identified in previous scans. Despite differences in ethnicity, ascertainment and phenotyping schemes, linkage results in ADHD appear remarkably consistent.

The human dopamine transporter (DAT1) gene is localized to chromosome 5p15.3 by in situ hybridization and PCR amplification of rodent somatic cell hybrid DNA. Analysis of a 40-bp repeat in the 3' untranslated region of the message revealed variable numbers of the repeat ranging from 3 to 11 copies. These results will aid in the investigation of a role for this gene in genetic disorders of the dopaminergic system in humans.

The dopamine transporter (DAT1) is a membrane spanning protein that binds the neurotransmitter dopamine and performs re-uptake of dopamine from the synapse into a neuron. The gene encoding DAT1 consists of 15 exons spanning 60 kb on chromosome 5p15.32. Several studies have investigated the possible associations between variants in DAT1 gene and psychiatric disorders. The present study aimed to determine the distribution of the variable number of tandem repeat (VNTR) polymorphism in the 3' untranslated region of DAT1 in 12 Indian populations. A total of 471 healthy unrelated individuals in 12 Indian populations from 3 linguistic groups were included in the present study. The analysis was carried out using PCR and electrophoresis. Overall, 4 alleles of the DAT1 40-bp VNTR, ranging from 7 to 11 repeats were detected. Heterozygosity indices were low and varied from 0.114 to 0.406. The results demonstrate the variability of the DAT1 40-bp VNTR polymorphism in Indian populations and revealed a high similarity with East Asian populations.

In 29 adults with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) striatal dopamine transporter (DAT) availability was assessed by [(99m)Tc]TRODAT-1 SPECT and correlated with 3' VNTR polymorphism of the DAT gene on chromosome 5p15.3. Seventeen patients showed homozygosity for the 10-repeat allele, two homozygosity of the 9 allele and 10 were heterozygous (9-10). No statistically significant difference in DAT availability was found between patients with 10-10 carriers (DAT 1.28 +/- 0.34) and with at least one 9 allele (DAT 1.31 +/- 0.27); when smokers were excluded, DAT availability was 1.38 +/- 0.28 in the 10-10 carriers (n = 12) and 1.42 +/- 0.19 in the 9-10 and 9-9 carriers (n = 7). In conclusion, no higher striatal DAT was found in patients with homozygosity of the 10 allele of the DAT gene in this study. These results differ from a study in 11 Korean children with ADHD, in which 10-10 carriers showed higher DAT availability in [(123)I]IPT SPECT. Discrepancies may be explained by differences in patient's age, ethnical differences, different imaging techniques or the limited number of patients included in both studies.

Previously, we had reported a genome-wide scan for attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) in 102 families with affected sibs of German ancestry; the highest multipoint LOD score of 4.75 was obtained on chromosome 5p13 (parametric HLOD analysis under a dominant model) near the dopamine transporter gene (DAT1). We genotyped 30 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in this candidate gene and its 5' region in 329 families (including the 102 initial families) with 523 affected offspring. We found that (1) SNP rs463379 was significantly associated with ADHD upon correction for multiple testing (P=0.0046); (2) the global P-value for association of haplotypes was significant for block two upon correction for all (n=3) tested blocks (P=0.0048); (3) within block two we detected a nominal P=0.000034 for one specific marker combination. This CGC haplotype showed relative risks of 1.95 and 2.43 for heterozygous and homozygous carriers, respectively; and (4) finally, our linkage data and the genotype-IBD sharing test (GIST) suggest that genetic variation at the DAT1 locus explains our linkage peak and that rs463379 (P<0.05) is the only SNP of the above haplotype that contributed to the linkage signal. In sum, we have accumulated evidence that genetic variation at the DAT1 locus underlies our ADHD linkage peak on chromosome 5; additionally solid association for a single SNP and a haplotype were shown. Future studies are required to assess if variation at this locus also explains other positive linkage results obtained for chromosome 5p.
