Metastasis is the primary cause of cancer-related death all over the world. Metastasis is a process by which cancer spreads from the place at which it first arose to distant locations in the body. It is well known that several steps are necessary for this process, including cancer cell epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT), cell migration, resistance to anoikis, and angiogenesis. Therefore, investigating the molecular mechanism of regulating cancer metastasis progress may provide helpful insights in the development of efficient diagnosis and therapeutic strategy. Recent studies have indicated that long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) play important roles in cancer metastasis. lncRNAs are the nonprotein coding RNAs that have a size longer than 200 nucleotides. More and more studies have indicated that lncRNAs are involved in a broad range of biological processes and are associated with many diseases, such as cancer. The role of lncRNAs in cancer metastasis has been widely studied; however, lncRNAs are mainly involved in the EMT process on the current literature. This review focuses on the mechanisms underlying the role of lncRNAs in cancer metastasis.

Although >85% of the human genome is transcribed, only <2% is transcribed into protein-coding RNA (messenger RNA, mRNA). Many thousands of noncoding RNAs are transcribed and recognized as functional RNAs with diverse sizes, structures, and biological functions. Based on size, noncoding RNA can be generally divided into two subgroups: short noncoding RNA (<200 nucleotides including microRNA or miRNA) and long noncoding RNA (lncRNA, >200 nucleotides). It is now clear that these RNAs fulfil critical roles as transcriptional and post-transcriptional regulators and as guides of chromatin-modifying complexes. Although not translated into protein, noncoding RNAs can regulate cardiac function through diverse mechanisms and their dysregulation is increasingly linked with cardiovascular pathophysiology. Furthermore, a series of recent studies have discovered that noncoding RNAs can be found in the bloodstream and some species are remarkably stable. This has raised the possibility that such noncoding RNAs may be measured in body fluids and serve as novel diagnostic biomarkers. Here, we summarize the current knowledge of noncoding RNAs' function and biomarker potential in cardiac diseases, concentrating mainly on circulating miRNAs and lncRNAs. J. Cell.

Long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) are more than 200 nucleotides in length and lack transcriptional ability. The biological function of lncRNAs in oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC) remains unclear. The aim of this study was to identify the dysfunction of lncRNA in OSCC. We analyzed the transcriptome profiles of human OSCC tissues and paired adjacent normal tissues from two patients through a next-generation sequencing approach. A total of 14 lncRNAs were upregulated (fold change ≥3) and 13 were downregulated (fold change ≤-3) in OSCC tissues compared with the adjacent normal tissues. SOX21-AS1 was subjected to further analysis, revealing that the expression levels of SOX21-AS1 significantly decreased in OSCC compared with the adjacent normal tissue. The promoter activity of SOX21-AS1 was obviously suppressed by in vitro methylation. The DNA methylation status of the SOX21-AS1 promoter was analyzed using combined bisulfite restriction analysis, revealing that the aberrant promoter hypermethylation of SOX21-AS1 was observed frequently in OSCC tissues. The effects of SOX21-AS1 on cell proliferation and invasion were examined through transient transfection. Our data showed that SOX21-AS1 could significantly suppress oral cancer cell growth and invasion. Furthermore, the low expression level of SOX21-AS1 was significantly correlated with an advanced stage (<i>P</i> = 0.047), large tumor size (<i>P</i> = 0.033), and poor disease-specific survival in OSCC patients (<i>P</i> = 0.002). SOX21-AS1 was identified as susceptible dysfunction correlated with promoter hypermethylation in OSCC. Low SOX21-AS1 expression may be an adverse prognostic biomarker for OSCC.

Current evidence suggests that the human genome produces a large number of non-coding RNAs, including microRNAs and long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs). Generally, lncRNAs are defined as RNA transcripts longer than 200 nucleotides that are not transcribed into proteins. In recent years, lncRNAs have been reported to play oncogenic roles in tumourigenesis. However, minimal research has been performed on the expression and clinicopathological significance of lncRNAs in papillary thyroid cancer (PTC). In the present study, we investigated not only the expression and clinicopathological significance of a novel lncRNA, NR_036575.1, in PTC tissues and adjacent non-cancerous tissues but also its potential function in TPC1 cells. The expression levels of the lncRNA NR_036575.1 in 83 pairs of PTC tissues and adjacent non-cancerous tissues were detected via quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction. The relationships between the expression levels and clinicopathological characteristics of the lncRNA NR_036575.1 were analysed. In addition, we established two receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves to assess the diagnostic value of NR_036575.1 expression. Cell Counting Kit-8 and transwell assays were used to assess cell proliferation and migration, respectively. The expression levels of the lncRNA NR_036575.1 were significantly higher in PTC tissues than in adjacent non-cancerous tissues. High NR_036575.1 expression was associated with extrathyroidal extension (ETE) (P = 0.011) and tumour size (P = 0.006). The ROC curves indicated that NR_036575.1 could potentially serve as a biomarker for identifying PTC and related, non-cancerous diseases (sensitivity, 80.7 %; specificity, 88 %), as well as for differentiating between PTC with or without ETE (sensitivity, 57.8 %; specificity, 86.7 %). NR_036575.1 knock-down significantly inhibited the proliferation and migration of TPC1 cells. Our findings are the first to describe lncRNA NR_036575.1 overexpression in PTC. NR_036575.1 expression was associated with both ETE and tumour size. In addition, NR_036575.1 modulation could regulate TPC1 cell proliferation and migration. The results of our study suggest that NR_036575.1 could be applied as a potential biomarker and a novel therapeutic target for PTC patients.
