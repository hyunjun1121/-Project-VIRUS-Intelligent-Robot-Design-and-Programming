Asciminib, a highly selective non-ATP competitive inhibitor of BCR-ABL, has demonstrated to be a promising drug for patients with chronic myeloid leukemia. It is a pity that two resistant mutations (I502L and V468F) have been found during the clinical trial, which is a challenge for the curative effect of Asciminib. In this study, molecular dynamics simulations and molecular mechanics generalized Born surface area (MM-GB/SA) calculations were performed to investigate the molecular mechanism of Asciminib resistance induced by the two mutants. The obtained results indicate that the mutations have adversely influence on the binding of Asciminib to BCR-ABL, as the nonpolar contributions decline in the two mutants. In addition, I502L mutation causes α-helix I' (αI') to shift away from the helical bundle composed of αE, αF, and αH, making the distance between αI' and Asciminib increased. For V468F mutant, the side chain of Phe468 occupies the bottom of the myristoyl pocket (MP), which drives Asciminib to shift toward the outside of MP. Our results provide the molecular insights of Asciminib resistance mechanism in BCR-ABL mutants, which may help the design of novel inhibitors.

Chronic myeloid leukaemia (CML) is driven by the activity of the BCR-ABL1 fusion oncoprotein. ABL1 kinase inhibitors have improved the clinical outcomes for patients with CML, with over 80% of patients treated with imatinib surviving for more than 10 years. Second-generation ABL1 kinase inhibitors induce more potent molecular responses in both previously untreated and imatinib-resistant patients with CML. Studies in patients with chronic-phase CML have shown that around 50% of patients who achieve and maintain undetectable BCR-ABL1 transcript levels for at least 2 years remain disease-free after the withdrawal of treatment. Here we characterize ABL001 (asciminib), a potent and selective allosteric ABL1 inhibitor that is undergoing clinical development testing in patients with CML and Philadelphia chromosome-positive (Ph<sup>+</sup>) acute lymphoblastic leukaemia. In contrast to catalytic-site ABL1 kinase inhibitors, ABL001 binds to the myristoyl pocket of ABL1 and induces the formation of an inactive kinase conformation. ABL001 and second-generation catalytic inhibitors have similar cellular potencies but distinct patterns of resistance mutations, with genetic barcoding studies revealing pre-existing clonal populations with no shared resistance between ABL001 and the catalytic inhibitor nilotinib. Consistent with this profile, acquired resistance was observed with single-agent therapy in mice; however, the combination of ABL001 and nilotinib led to complete disease control and eradicated CML xenograft tumours without recurrence after the cessation of treatment.

Asciminib (previously ABL001), which binds the myristate-binding pocket of the Bcr-Abl kinase domain, is in phase I clinical trials as monotherapy and in combination with imatinib, nilotinib and dasatinib for the treatment of patients with refractory CML or Ph+ ALL. Asciminib sensitivity was evaluated in asciminib naïve <i>BCR-ABL1+</i> cell lines K562 (negligible ABCB1/ABCG2 expression), K562-Dox (ABCB1-overexpressing through doxorubicin exposure) and K562-ABCG2 (ABCG2 overexpression via transduction) with results demonstrating asciminib efflux by both ABCB1 and ABCG2 transporters. K562-Dox and K562-ABCG2 cells demonstrated increased LD50<sup>asciminib</sup> vs K562 control cells: 256 and 299 nM respectively vs 24 nM, <i>p <</i> 0.001. Sensitivity was completely restored with specific inhibitors cyclosporine (ABCB1) and Ko143 (ABCG2): K562-Dox LD50<sup>asciminib+cyclosporine</sup> = 13 nM, K562-ABCG2 LD50<sup>asciminib+Ko143</sup> = 15 nM (<i>p</i> < 0.001). When asciminib resistance was modelled <i>in vitro</i>, ABCB1 and ABCG2 overexpression was integral in the development of asciminib resistance. In K562 asciminib-resistant cells, ABCG2 expression increased prior to <i>BCR-ABL1</i> overexpression and remained high (up to 7.6-fold greater levels in resistant vs control cells, <i>p <</i> 0.001). K562-Dox asciminib-resistant cells had increased ABCB1 expression (2.1-fold vs control cells <i>p</i> = 0.0033). KU812 asciminib-resistant cells overexpressed ABCB1 (5.4-fold increase, <i>p <</i> 0.001) and ABCG2 (6-fold increase, <i>p <</i> 0.001) before emergence of a novel myristate-binding pocket mutation (F497L). In all three cell lines, asciminib resistance was reversible upon chemical inhibition of ABCB1, ABCG2 or both (<i>p <</i> 0.001). When K562 asciminib-resistant cells were treated with asciminib in combination with clinically achievable doses of either imatinib or nilotinib, reversal of the resistance phenotype was also observed (<i>p <</i> 0.01). Overexpression of efflux transporters will likely be an important pathway for asciminib resistance in the clinical setting. Given the lack of evidence for ABCG2-mediated transport of nilotinib or imatinib at clinically relevant concentrations, our data provide an additional rationale for using asciminib in combination with either TKI.

Asciminib is an allosteric inhibitor that binds a myristoyl site of the BCR-ABL1 protein, locking BCR-ABL1 into an inactive conformation through a mechanism distinct from those for all other ABL kinase inhibitors. Asciminib targets both native and mutated BCR-ABL1, including the gatekeeper T315I mutant. The safety and antileukemic activity of asciminib in patients with Philadelphia chromosome-positive leukemia are unknown. In this phase 1, dose-escalation study, we enrolled 141 patients with chronic-phase and 9 with accelerated-phase chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) who had resistance to or unacceptable side effects from at least two previous ATP-competitive tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs). The primary objective was to determine the maximum tolerated dose or the recommended dose (or both) of asciminib. Asciminib was administered once or twice daily (at doses of 10 to 200 mg). The median follow-up was 14 months. Patients were heavily pretreated; 70% (105 of 150 patients) had received at least three TKIs. The maximum tolerated dose of asciminib was not reached. Among patients with chronic-phase CML, 34 (92%) with a hematologic relapse had a complete hematologic response; 31 (54%) without a complete cytogenetic response at baseline had a complete cytogenetic response. A major molecular response was achieved or maintained by 12 months in 48% of patients who could be evaluated, including 8 of 14 (57%) deemed to have resistance to or unacceptable side effects from ponatinib. A major molecular response was achieved or maintained by 12 months in 5 patients (28%) with a T315I mutation at baseline. Clinical responses were durable; a major molecular response was maintained in 40 of 44 patients. Dose-limiting toxic effects included asymptomatic elevations in the lipase level and clinical pancreatitis. Common adverse events included fatigue, headache, arthralgia, hypertension, and thrombocytopenia. Asciminib was active in heavily pretreated patients with CML who had resistance to or unacceptable side effects from TKIs, including patients in whom ponatinib had failed and those with a T315I mutation.

Asciminib is a potent, specific BCR-ABL1 inhibitor being developed for the treatment of patients with chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML) and Philadelphia chromosome positive acute lymphoblastic leukemia (Ph + ALL).Here, we present the results of human oral absorption, distribution, metabolism, excretion (ADME) and <i>in vitro</i> studies that together provide an overall understanding of the metabolism, distribution and clearance of asciminib in humans.Asciminib was rapidly absorbed with a maximum plasma concentration at two hours post-dose. Total radioactivity and asciminib showed similar terminal half-lives in plasma.Oral asciminib absorption ranged between a minimum of 33%, and a maximum of 57% based on the metabolite profiles of late time-point feces collections.Asciminib was eliminated mainly through feces <i>via</i> unchanged asciminib excretion and metabolism.Direct glucuronidation and oxidation were major metabolic pathways in human that were catalyzed predominantly by UDP-glucuronosyltransferase (UGT)2B7 and cytochrome P450 (CYP)3A4, respectively.The relative contribution of the glucuronidation pathway to the total clearance of asciminib via metabolism is estimated to range ∼28-58%, whereas the relative contribution of the oxidative pathway is estimated to range ∼37-64%, based upon the maximum oral absorption in humans.

Bcr-Abl is an oncogenic fusion protein which expression enhances tumorigenesis, and has been highly associated with chronic myeloid leukemia (CML). Acquired drug resistance in mutant Bcr-Abl has enhanced pathogenesis with the use of single therapy agents such as nilotinib. Moreover, allosteric targeting has been identified to consequentially inhibit Bcr-Abl activity, which led to the recent development of ABL-001 (asciminib) that selectively binds the myristoyl pocket. Experimental studies have revealed that the combination of nilotinib and ABL-001 induced a 'bent' conformation in the C-terminal helix of Bcr-Abl; a benchmark of inhibition, thereby exhibiting a greater potency in the treatment of CML, surmounting the setbacks of drug resistance, disease regression and relapse. Therefore, we report the first account of the dynamics and conformational analysis of oncogenic T334I Bcr-Abl by dual targeting. Our findings revealed that unlike in the Bcr-Abl-Nilotinib complex, dual targeting by both inhibitors induced the bent conformation in the C-terminal helix that varied with time. This was coupled with significant alteration in Bcr-Abl stability, flexibility, and compactness and an overall structural re-orientation inwards towards the hydrophobic core, which reduced the solvent-exposed residues indicative of protein folding. This study will facilitate allosteric targeting and the design of more potent allosteric inhibitors for resistive target proteins in cancer.

BCR-ABL1 point mutation-mediated resistance to tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI) therapy in Philadelphia chromosome-positive (Ph<sup>+</sup>) leukemia is effectively managed with several approved drugs, including ponatinib for BCR-ABL1<sup>T315I</sup>-mutant disease. However, therapy options are limited for patients with leukemic clones bearing multiple BCR-ABL1 mutations. Asciminib, an allosteric inhibitor targeting the myristoyl-binding pocket of BCR-ABL1, is active against most single mutants but ineffective against all tested compound mutants. We demonstrate that combining asciminib with ATP site TKIs enhances target inhibition and suppression of resistant outgrowth in Ph<sup>+</sup> clinical isolates and cell lines. Inclusion of asciminib restores ponatinib's effectiveness against currently untreatable compound mutants at clinically achievable concentrations. Our findings support combining asciminib with ponatinib as a treatment strategy for this molecularly defined group of patients.

Asciminib (ABL001) is an orally administered allosteric inhibitor of the BCR-ABL tyrosine kinase. The current study evaluated the relative bioavailability of its 2 tablet variants, AAA and NXA, compared with the capsule CSF and assessed the impact of food in healthy participants in a 2-arm, randomized, open-label, 4-way crossover design. The primary pharmacokinetic parameters analyzed were area under the plasma concentration-time curve (AUC) from time 0 to the time of last measurable concentration (AUC<sub>last</sub> ), AUC from time 0 to infinity (AUC<sub>inf</sub> ), and peak concentration (C<sub>max</sub> ). Forty-five healthy volunteers were enrolled, 22 in the AAA arm and 23 in the NXA arm. Under fasting conditions, the AUC<sub>inf</sub> , AUC<sub>last</sub> , and C<sub>max</sub> of the AAA tablet were similar to those of the capsule, but slightly higher (∼20%) for NXA and decreased with a high-fat meal (∼65%) and a low-fat meal (∼30%) for both tablet formulations. Overall, 20 participants (9 in the AAA arm; 11 in the NXA arm) experienced at least 1 adverse event, the most common in both arms being headache. The study showed that under fasting conditions, tablet AAA had bioavailability similar to that in the capsule CSF. The bioavailability of both tablet formulations decreased with food, with a more pronounced effect observed with a high-fat meal.

Chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) is characterized by a pathognomonic chromosomal translocation, which leads to the fusion of breakpoint cluster region (BCR) and Abelson leukemia virus 1 (ABL1) genes, generating an oncoprotein with deregulated tyrosine kinase activity. Areas covered: In the last two decades, BCR/ABL1 kinase has become the molecular target for tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs), a class of drugs that impressively improved overall survival. Despite these results, a proportion of patients experiences resistance to TKIs and need to change treatment. Furthermore, TKIs are unable to eradicate leukemic stem cells, allowing the persistence of neoplastic clones. Therefore, there is still clinical need for new agents to overcome common resistance mechanisms to available drugs. This review explores the horizon of drugs actually under investigation for CML patients resistant to conventional treatment. Expert commentary: Radotinib is an ATP-competitive TKI that showed significant activity also in front-line setting and could find employment indications in CML. Asciminib, an allosteric ABL1 inhibitor, could demonstrate a higher capacity in overcoming common TKIs resistant mutations, including T315I, but clinical findings are needed. CML stem cell target will probably require new therapeutic strategies: combinations of several compounds acting with different mechanisms of action are actually under investigation.

Chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML) arises from the constitutive activity of the BCR-ABL1 oncoprotein. Tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) that target the ATP-binding site have transformed CML into a chronic manageable disease. However, some patients develop drug resistance due to ATP-site mutations impeding drug binding. We describe the discovery of asciminib (ABL001), the first allosteric BCR-ABL1 inhibitor to reach the clinic. Asciminib binds to the myristate pocket of BCR-ABL1 and maintains activity against TKI-resistant ATP-site mutations. Although resistance can emerge due to myristate-site mutations, these are sensitive to ATP-competitive inhibitors so that combinations of asciminib with ATP-competitive TKIs suppress the emergence of resistance. Fragment-based screening using NMR and X-ray yielded ligands for the myristate pocket. An NMR-based conformational assay guided the transformation of these inactive ligands into ABL1 inhibitors. Further structure-based optimization for potency, physicochemical, pharmacokinetic, and drug-like properties, culminated in asciminib, which is currently undergoing clinical studies in CML patients.
