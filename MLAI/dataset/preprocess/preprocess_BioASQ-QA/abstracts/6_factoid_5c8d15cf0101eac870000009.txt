Small intestinal epithelial cells (IEC) play a major role in the absorption of nutrients and toxins. Due to the similarity of genome-wide single copy protein orthologues between cattle and human, establishment of ruminant's primary small IEC culture could be a valuable tool for toxicity studies. Therefore, the current study focused on the development and characterization of buffalo IEC culture, as cattle slaughter is banned in India. The buffalo jejunum fragments were washed consecutively several times in saline, warm phosphate buffered saline (PBS), PBS with 5 mM dithiothreitol, digesting solution and 2% sorbitol in PBS. The cells were cultured on 17 µg/cm<sup>2</sup> collagen coated plates and transwell plates with serum (2% Fetal bovine serum (FBS) and 10% FBS) and serum-free culture conditions. The cells were differentiated into typical epithelial cobblestone morphology from day 5 onwards in 50% successful cultures. The cultured IEC were characterized by gene expression of epithelial cell markers, cytokeratin and vimentin, and enterocyte markers like villin, zonula occluden (ZO1), fatty acid binding protein 2 (FABP2) and small intestinal peptidase (IP). Based on the morphology and gene expression profile, 10% FBS has been recommended for culturing primary buffalo IEC on collagen coated plates for 10 days. However, 50% of the successful cultures could not show epithelial phenotype on 10% FBS culture conditions even on collagen coated plates. Interestingly, undifferentiated IEC showed an increasing expression of FABP2, IP and ZO1 transcripts compared to differentiated intestinal cells with 10% FBS on collagen plates. Therefore, future studies are needed to understand the role of FABP2, IP and ZO1 in differentiation of buffalo IEC.

The human intestinal fatty acid binding protein 2 (FABP2) mediates fat absorption by binding and intracellular trafficking of long-chain free fatty acids. Studies with knockout mice and association analysis of polymorphisms revealed that FABP2 is a susceptibility gene for type 2 diabetes (noninsulin dependent diabetes mellitus [NIDDM]) and related traits. Relevant FABP2 promoter polymorphisms c.-80_-79insT (rs5861422), c.-136_-132delAGTAG (rs5861423), c.-168_-166delAAGinsT (rs1973598), c.-260G>A (rs6857641), c.-471G>A (rs2282688), and c.-778G>T (rs10034579) result in two haplotypes A and B, whereby B possesses two- to three-fold lower transcriptional activity than A. We show in luciferase reporter gene assays by a series of chimeric FABP2 promoter constructs in intestinal Caco-2 cells that polymorphism c.-80_-79insT essentially determines different activities of the FABP2 promoter. In accordance, in electrophoretic mobility shift assays (EMSAs), transcriptional factors GATA-5 and -6 bind with higher binding affinities to the FABP2 promoter region containing the -80A allele compared to B. As functional consequence, haplotype A is twice as much more activated by GATA factors than haplotype B in liver Huh7 cells. Additionally, a construct bearing the -80B allele in the background of haplotype A reversed the activity from A to B. Thus, the GATA mediated differential activation of FABP2 haplotypes depends on polymorphism c.-80_-79insT. This provides the molecular basis for the variant specific transcriptional regulation of the diabetes type 2-associated FABP2 gene.

Msi1 (Musashi 1) is regarded as a marker for neural and intestinal epithelial stem cells. However, it is still unclear whether Msi1-positive cells derived from mouse embryonic stem cells have the ability to differentiate into neural or intestinal epithelial cells. A pMsi1-GFP (green fluorescent protein) reporter plasmid was constructed in order to sort Msi1-positive cells out of the differentiated cell population. The GFP-positive cells (i.e. Msi1-positive cells) were sorted by FACS and were hypodermically engrafted into the backs of NOD/SCID (non-obese diabetic/severe combined immunodeficient) mice. The presence of neural and intestinal epithelial cells in the grafts was detected. Msi1 was highly expressed in the GFP-positive cells, but not in the GFP-negative cells. The markers for neural cells (Nestin and Tubulin β III) and intestinal epithelial cells [FABP2 (fatty acid binding protein 2), Lyz (lysozyme) and ChA (chromogranin A)] were more highly expressed in the grafts from Msi1-positive cells than those from Msi1-negative cells (P<0.05). The grafts from the Msi1-negative cells contained more mesodermal-like tissues than those from the Msi1-positive cells. The pMsi1-GFP vector can be used to sort Msi1-positive cells from a cell population derived from mouse embryonic stem cells. The Msi1-positive cells can differentiate into neural and intestinal epithelial-like cells in vivo.

Variants of the human intestinal fatty acid binding protein 2 gene (FABP2) are associated with traits of the metabolic syndrome. Relevant FABP2 promoter polymorphisms c.-80_-79insT, c.-136_-132delAGTAG, c.-168_-166delAAGinsT, c.-260G>A, c.-471G>A, and c.-778G>T result in two haplotypes A and B. Activation of haplotypes by rosiglitazone stimulated PPARgamma/RXRalpha leads to 2-fold higher activity of haplotype B than A. As shown by chimeric FABP2 promoter constructs, the higher responsiveness of FABP2 haplotype B is mainly but not solely determined by polymorphism c.-471G>A. As shown by EMSA and promoter-reporter assays, Oct-1 interacts with the -471 region of FABP2 promoters, induces the activities of both FABP2 promoter haplotypes and abolishes the different activities of haplotypes induced by rosiglitazone activated PPARgamma/RXRalpha. In conclusion, our findings suggest a functional role of PPARgamma/RXRalpha and Oct-1 in the regulation of the FABP2 gene.

This meta-analysis aimed to determine the role of human fatty acid binding protein 2 (FABP2) expression in the diagnosis of necrotizing enterocolitis (NEC) of newborns. Eligible studies for further statistical analysis were identified from various databases including PubMed, Expert Medica Database, Web of Science, Cochrane Library, Google Scholar, China BioMedicine and China National Knowledge Infrastructure. Random effects model was used, and summary standardized mean difference (SMD) with its 95% confidence interval (CI) was calculated to assess the association of FABP2 expression and NEC. Ten articles which included 572 infants (262 infants with NEC and 310 healthy controls) were included in the current meta-analysis. FABP2 showed a positive relationship with NEC of newborns (SMD=2.88, 95% CI=2.09-3.67, P<0.001). And FABP2 expression was higher in patients with advanced stage of NEC (stage III or stage II+III) than in those with early stage of NEC (stage I) (SMD=-0.48, 95% CI=-0.87 to -0.09, P=0.015). Ethnicity-stratified analysis yielded significantly different estimates with a high FABP2 expression in NEC in both Caucasians (SMD=3.16, 95% CI=1.90-4.43, P<0.001) and Asians (SMD=2.57, 95% CI=1.50-3.64, P<0.001). Sample-based subgroup analysis showed that FABP2 expression was positively correlated with neonatal NEC in both urinary- and blood-sample subgroups (all P<0.05). The results prove that the high FABP2 expression is related to the damage to intestinal cells, which may be a possible early detection marker identifying neonatal NEC.

The human fatty acid binding protein (FABP2) is involved in intestinal absorption and intracellular trafficking of long-chain fatty acids. Here we investigate transcriptional regulation of FABP2 by the endodermal hepatic nuclear factor 1 alpha (HNF-1alpha). In electromobility shift and supershift assays we show the presence of two adjacent HNF-1alpha binding sites within the FABP2 promoter regions -185 to -165 and -169 to -149. HNF-1alpha activates an FABP2 promoter luciferase construct by 3.5 and 20-fold in Caco-2 and Hela cells, respectively. Mutational analysis of HNF-1alpha elements resulted in about 50% reduction of basal and HNF-1alpha induced activity of FABP2 promoter constructs, predominantly caused by deletion of the -185 to -165 site. Thus, our data suggest a major role of HNF-1alpha in control of FABP2 expression in intestine via a functional HNF-1alpha recognition element within FABP2 promoter region -185 to -165.
