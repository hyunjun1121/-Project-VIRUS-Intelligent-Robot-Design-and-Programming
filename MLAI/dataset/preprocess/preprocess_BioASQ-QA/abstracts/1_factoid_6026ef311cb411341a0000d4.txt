Eptinezumab-jjmr (referred to as eptinezumab hereafter; Vyeptiâ„¢) is a humanised monoclonal antibody that binds to calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP) and blocks its binding to the receptor. CGRP is believed to play a major role in the pathophysiology of migraine. Eptinezumab, delivered by intravenous (IV) administration, is being developed by Lundbeck Seattle BioPharmaceuticals for the prevention of migraine. In February 2020, eptinezumab was approved in the USA for the preventive treatment of migraine in adults. This article summarizes the milestones in the development of eptinezumab leading to this first approval.
