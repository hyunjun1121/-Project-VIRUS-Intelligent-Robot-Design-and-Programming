Accumulating evidence suggests that IL-17 A has broad pathogenic roles in multiple autoimmune and immune-mediated inflammatory diseases, including psoriasis and rheumatoid arthritis (RA). The development of new therapies that inhibit IL-17 pathway signaling is of clinical significance. This review aims to summarize the current preclinical evidence on the role of Th17 cells and IL-17 and related cytokines in immune-mediated disease pathophysiology, with a focus on psoriasis and rheumatoid arthritis, as well as to summarize recent clinical trials in these indications with newly developed IL-17 pathway inhibitors. A systematic literature search was conducted of PubMed using relevant keywords. Studies were assessed according to recent relevance to IL-17-mediated pathophysiology and clinical IL-17 inhibition. Experimental animal models of autoimmune disease and clinical studies that focused on IL-17 pathway inhibitors were included. Preclinical studies suggest that IL-17A is an attractive therapeutic target. Several IL-17A inhibitors have advanced into clinical trials, including the anti-IL-17A monoclonal antibodies, secukinumab and ixekizumab, and the anti-17RA monoclonal antibody brodalumab. Each has shown variable and sometimes favorable results in proof-of-concept and phase II clinical trials and is currently undergoing further clinical evaluation in a range of immune-mediated diseases. Targeting the IL-17 pathway shows promise as strategy to treat immune-mediated diseases ranging from skin to joints.

The authors tested whether the anti-interleukin (IL)-17A monoclonal antibody secukinumab was safe and effective for the treatment of active Crohn's disease. In a double-blind, randomised, placebo-controlled proof-of-concept study, 59 patients with moderate to severe Crohn's disease (Crohn's Disease Activity Index (CDAI) ≥220 to ≤450) were assigned in a 2:1 ratio to 2×10 mg/kg intravenous secukinumab or placebo. The primary end point, addressed by bayesian statistics augmented with historical placebo information, was the probability that secukinumab reduces the CDAI by ≥50 points more than placebo at week 6. Ancillary analyses explored associations of 35 candidate genetic polymorphisms and faecal calprotectin response. 59 patients (39 secukinumab, 20 placebo, mean baseline CDAI 307 and 301, respectively) were recruited. 18/59 (31%) patients discontinued prematurely (12/39 (31%) secukinumab, 6/20 (30%) placebo), 10/59 (17%) due to insufficient therapeutic effect (8/39 (21%) secukinumab, 2/20 (10%) placebo). Fourteen serious adverse events occurred in 10 patients (seven secukinumab, three placebo); 20 infections, including four local fungal infections, were seen on secukinumab versus none on placebo. Primary end point analysis estimated <0.1% probability (CDAI (SD) =33.9 (19.7), 95% credible interval -4.9 to 72.9) that secukinumab reduces CDAI by ≥50 points more than placebo. Secondary area under the curve analysis (weeks 4-10) showed a significant difference (mean ΔCDAI=49; 95% CI (2 to 96), p=0.043) in favour of placebo. Post hoc subgroup analysis showed that unfavourable responses on secukinumab were driven by patients with elevated inflammatory markers (CRP≥10 mg/l and/or faecal calprotectin≥200 ng/ml; mean ΔCDAI=62; 95% CI (-1 to 125), p=0.054 in favour of placebo). Absence of the minor allele of tumour necrosis factor-like ligand 1A was strongly associated with lack of response measured by baseline-adjusted changes in calprotectin at week 6 (p=0.00035 Bonferroni-corrected). Blockade of IL-17A was ineffective and higher rates of adverse events were noted compared with placebo. This trial was registered at ClinicalTrial.gov with the number NCT01009281.

The IL-23/IL-17 pathway may be a novel therapeutic target for the treatment of psoriatic arthritis (PsA). The potential beneficial effect of Th-17A antagonism has been investigated by a randomized controlled trial in PsA patients with secukinumab, a fully human, high-affinity, monoclonal antibody in a cohort of patients with active PsA. Although this Phase II study presents bias that limits the ability of this drug to meet the primary and some secondary end points, the authors suggest that secukinumab may have biological effects and some clinical benefits in PsA patients. Further studies are required to demonstrate if the rationale to use drugs acting on the IL-23/IL-17 pathway is associated with relevant efficacy and safety in the treatment of PsA.

Secukinumab, a fully human anti-interleukin-17A monoclonal antibody, demonstrated efficacy and safety in moderate-to-severe plaque psoriasis when administered via subcutaneous injection. Self-administration by pre-filled syringe (PFS) can offer patients clinical benefits of a drug, with increased convenience. To assess efficacy, safety and usability of secukinumab administration via PFS in subjects with moderate-to-severe plaque psoriasis. Subjects in this phase 3 trial were randomized 1 : 1 : 1 to secukinumab 300 or 150 mg or matching placebo. Results to week 12 are presented here. Each treatment was delivered using a PFS once weekly to week 4, and again at week 8. Co-primary endpoints were secukinumab superiority over placebo for week 12 PASI 75 (≥ 75% reduction in Psoriasis Area and Severity Index) and IGA mod 2011 (2011 modified Investigator's Global Assessment) 0/1 response rates. Secondary endpoints included PFS usability, determined by observer rating of successful, hazard-free self-injection and subject rating of acceptability by the Self-Injection Assessment Questionnaire (SIAQ). Co-primary endpoints were met, with demonstration of superiority for each secukinumab dose vs. placebo at week 12 (PASI 75: 75·9%, 69·5% and 0% for secukinumab 300 mg, 150 mg and placebo; IGA mod 2011 0/1: 69·0%, 52·5% and 0%, respectively; P < 0·0001 for all comparisons vs. placebo). PFS usability was high: 100% of subjects successfully self-administered treatment at week 1, and subjects reported high SIAQ-assessed acceptability of the PFS throughout the trial. No new/unexpected safety signals were observed. Secukinumab administration by PFS was effective, with an acceptable safety profile and high usability. The PFS provides a reliable, convenient form of secukinumab administration in subjects with moderate-to-severe plaque psoriasis.

Clinical and experimental evidence suggest that interleukin-17A (IL-17A; also known as IL-17) is an attractive therapeutic target in rheumatoid arthritis (RA). Rheumatoid synovial tissue produces IL-17A, which causes cartilage and bone degradation in synovial and bone explants. Overexpression of IL-17A induces synovial inflammation and joint destruction in animal RA models. These effects are attenuated in IL-17A-deficient animals and by agents that block IL-17A. Serum IL-17A levels and, to a greater extent, synovial fluid IL-17A levels are elevated in many patients with RA. In some RA cohorts, higher IL-17A levels have been associated with a more severe clinical course. Several IL-17A blockers, including the anti-IL-17A monoclonal antibodies secukinumab and ixekizumab, and the anti-IL-17 receptor subunit A monoclonal antibody brodalumab have been evaluated in phase II clinical trials. Of these, secukinumab is the most advanced with respect to clinical evaluation in RA, with phase III trials ongoing in patients on background methotrexate who had inadequate responses to previous tumor necrosis factor blocker therapy.

Our objective was to evaluate the efficacy of influenza and meningococcal vaccinations in healthy subjects exposed to the anti-interleukin-17A (IL-17A) monoclonal antibody (MAb) secukinumab. We used an open-label, parallel-group, randomized single-center study of 50 healthy subjects. Subjects received a single 150-mg dose of secukinumab or no treatment, followed by vaccination with inactivated trivalent subunit influenza virus and conjugate group C meningococcal vaccine (Agrippal and Menjugate, respectively) 2 weeks later. Primary efficacy variables were responses of ≥4-fold increases in antibody titer (hemagglutination inhibition [HI; for influenza virus] and serum bactericidal assay [SBA; for Neisseria meningitides]) for meningococcus and influenza (at least two out of three serotypes), both at 4 weeks postvaccination. All subjects randomized to secukinumab (n = 25) or the control (n = 25) completed the study. Antibody responses to vaccinations measured at 4 weeks were comparable in both groups, with ≥4-fold increased responses following influenza virus vaccination of 20/25 (80%) for both groups and following meningococcal vaccination of 19/25 (76%) for the secukinumab group and 18/25 (72%) for the control group. Differences between groups were 0% (90% confidence intervals [CI], 19 and 19%) and 4% (90% CI, 16 and 24%) for influenza virus and meningococcal vaccines, respectively. Antibody responses were comparable between the 2 groups at different time points. Headache was the most frequently reported adverse effect. No deaths or serious adverse events were reported. Blockade of IL-17A by secukinumab does not appear to interfere with efficacy of influenza and meningococcal vaccinations, as assessed by the achievement of protective antibody levels. A protective (≥4-fold) immune response to both vaccinations at 4 weeks was achieved in 80 and 76% of subjects exposed to secukinumab and the control, respectively.

Unmet therapeutic needs in Behçet's disease have drawn recent attention to biological agents targeting cytokines other than TNF. The anti-IL-17 antibody secukinumab and the anti-IL-2 receptor antibody daclizumab were not superior to placebo for ocular Behçet's in randomised controlled trials, comprising 118 and 17 patients, respectively. The anti-IL-1 agents anakinra and canakinumab and the anti-IL-6 agent tocilizumab were given to isolated refractory disease patients, who were either anti-TNF naïve (n=9) or experienced (n=18). No new safety signals were reported. Although a potential for bias to report positive effects and underreport negative cases may exist, Anakinra was partially effective, whereas disease remission was noted after canakinumab in some anti-TNF resistant patients. Tocilizumab appeared effective for neuro-Behçet's, but not for mucocutaneous manifestations. Finally, in a pilot study of 7 patients with relapsing posterior uveitis refractory to azathioprine and/or cyclosporine, the anti-IL-1β antibody Gevokizumab was beneficial. Collectively, it seems that IL-1 and IL-6 are promising targets in patients refractory or intolerant to other regimens including anti-TNFs. However, controlled studies are surely needed.

Genetic studies and correlative expression data in diseased tissues have pointed to the role of interleukin (IL)-17 and Th17 cells in the pathogenesis of autoimmune disorders such as psoriasis, inflammatory bowel disease and seronegative spondyloarthropathies. Th17 cells are known to produce the proinflammatory cytokine IL-17A as well as other effector cytokines, including IL-17F and IL-22. Recent research has demonstrated that IL-17A is also expressed by multiple lineages of the innate immune system, including mast cells, neutrophils, dendritic cells, γδ-T cells, macrophages and natural killer cells. It can thus be expected that the inhibition of IL-17A as a therapeutic target in autoimmune disease would exert different physiological effects than the suppression of Th17 cell activity. Early clinical data are now available on secukinumab (AIN457), a recombinant, highly selective, fully human monoclonal anti-IL-17A antibody of the IgG1/κ isotype, enabling a preliminary assessment of the effects of IL-17A inhibition in multiple autoimmune diseases. Rapid and sustained symptom reductions in psoriasis, rheumatoid arthritis, psoriatic arthritis and ankylosing spondylitis have been observed in secukinumab-treated patients, with no overt safety signals. In conjunction with studies using the humanised anti-IL-17A monoclonal antibody (mAb) ixekizumab (LY2439821) and the fully human anti-IL-17RA mAb brodalumab (AMG 827), the findings on secukinumab provide evidence for the role of IL-17A in the pathophysiology of autoimmune disease and suggest the potential value of targeting this cytokine.

The contribution of Th17 cells to the development of colitis is well described. The effector cytokines IL-17A and IL-17F have been proposed as potential therapeutic targets for the treatment of patients with inflammatory bowel disease. In a proof-of-concept study for the treatment of patients with Crohn's disease, secukinumab, a monoclonal antibody directed against IL-17A, was ineffective and associated with more adverse events than placebo. Wedebye Schmidt et al. propose that blockade of both IL-17A and IL-17F, rather than either cytokine alone, attenuates the development of colitis in a T-cell transfer model of experimental colitis. These findings suggest that combined blockade of IL-17A and IL-17F may be an effective strategy for the treatment of patients with inflammatory bowel disease.

IL-23 is a pro-inflammatory cytokine belonging to the IL-12 cytokine family. IL-23 is essential for the differentiation of Th17 lymphocytes, a subtype of T lymphocyte implicated in chronic inflammatory/autoimmune mediated diseases. IL-23 and Th17 correspond to a new axis that drives immune activation and chronic inflammation through the differentiation and activation of Th17 cells. Animal models of chronic inflammatory diseases such as chronic joint diseases, inflammatory bowel diseases and demyelinating diseases strongly suggest the involvement of this cytokine pathway. Thus, IL-23/Th17 is considered as a relevant therapeutic target in autoimmune driven diseases, and biological agents blocking IL-23 or IL-17 are currently being developed. Ustekinumab is a monoclonal antibody targeting the common p40 subunit of IL-12 and IL-23. This treatment has demonstrated its efficacy over placebo in randomized placebo controlled trials and is currently licensed for the treatment of psoriasis. It has also demonstrated its efficacy in psoriatic arthritis. Results for Crohn's disease were less evident, while ustekinumab was ineffective in multiple sclerosis. Secukinumab is an IL-17A monoclonal antibody that is under development and preliminary results have suggested its efficacy in inflammatory mediated diseases such as psoriasis and ankylosing spondylitis. Several other IL-23 or IL-17 neutralizing agents are being evaluated in clinical trials. The biological properties of the IL-23/Th17/IL-17 axis and the clinical applications of the drugs that aim to block its functions are reviewed here. Targeting the IL-23/Th17 axis seems to be a relevant and realistic therapeutic approach and these new agents pave the way for additive and alternative treatments to currently available biologics in chronic inflammatory diseases.

The third part of this in-depth review series on the treatment of multiple sclerosis (MS) with monoclonal antibodies covers the years 2010-2012. The natalizumab section gives a progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy update, focusing on clinically relevant aspects. Furthermore, it outlines problems around natalizumab cessation and current evidence on therapeutic strategies thereafter. Finally, it reviews evidence on Janus-faced modes of natalizumab action besides anti-inflammatory effects, including proinflammatory effects. The section on alemtuzumab critically analyzes recent Phase III results and discusses which patients might be best suited for alemtuzumab treatment, and reviews the long-term immunological impact of this anti-CD52 antibody. The daclizumab section critically summarizes results from the Phase IIb SELECT/SELECTION trial and introduces the Phase III program. The section on anti-CD20 antibodies reviews Phase II results on ocrelizumab and ofatumumab, and discusses current perspectives of these antibodies for MS therapy. Promising recent Phase II results on the anti-IL-17A antibody secukinumab (AIN457) are outlined and a short update on tabalumab (LY2127399) is given. Other highlighted antibodies currently being tested in MS patients include GNbAC1, BIIB033, MOR103 and MEDI-551. Finally, the authors give an update on the role monoclonal antibodies could play in the therapeutic armamentarium for MS in the medium term.

Interleukin-17A is considered to be central to the pathogenesis of psoriasis. We evaluated secukinumab, a fully human anti-interleukin-17A monoclonal antibody, in patients with moderate-to-severe plaque psoriasis. In two phase 3, double-blind, 52-week trials, ERASURE (Efficacy of Response and Safety of Two Fixed Secukinumab Regimens in Psoriasis) and FIXTURE (Full Year Investigative Examination of Secukinumab vs. Etanercept Using Two Dosing Regimens to Determine Efficacy in Psoriasis), we randomly assigned 738 patients (in the ERASURE study) and 1306 patients (in the FIXTURE study) to subcutaneous secukinumab at a dose of 300 mg or 150 mg (administered once weekly for 5 weeks, then every 4 weeks), placebo, or (in the FIXTURE study only) etanercept at a dose of 50 mg (administered twice weekly for 12 weeks, then once weekly). The objective of each study was to show the superiority of secukinumab over placebo at week 12 with respect to the proportion of patients who had a reduction of 75% or more from baseline in the psoriasis area-and-severity index score (PASI 75) and a score of 0 (clear) or 1 (almost clear) on a 5-point modified investigator's global assessment (coprimary end points). The proportion of patients who met the criterion for PASI 75 at week 12 was higher with each secukinumab dose than with placebo or etanercept: in the ERASURE study, the rates were 81.6% with 300 mg of secukinumab, 71.6% with 150 mg of secukinumab, and 4.5% with placebo; in the FIXTURE study, the rates were 77.1% with 300 mg of secukinumab, 67.0% with 150 mg of secukinumab, 44.0% with etanercept, and 4.9% with placebo (P<0.001 for each secukinumab dose vs. comparators). The proportion of patients with a response of 0 or 1 on the modified investigator's global assessment at week 12 was higher with each secukinumab dose than with placebo or etanercept: in the ERASURE study, the rates were 65.3% with 300 mg of secukinumab, 51.2% with 150 mg of secukinumab, and 2.4% with placebo; in the FIXTURE study, the rates were 62.5% with 300 mg of secukinumab, 51.1% with 150 mg of secukinumab, 27.2% with etanercept, and 2.8% with placebo (P<0.001 for each secukinumab dose vs. comparators). The rates of infection were higher with secukinumab than with placebo in both studies and were similar to those with etanercept. Secukinumab was effective for psoriasis in two randomized trials, validating interleukin-17A as a therapeutic target.

The family of interleukin 17 receptors (IL17Rs), subtypes IL17RA-IL17RE, is targeted by the group of pro-inflammatory IL17 cytokines (IL17A-F) and moreover the newly developed anti-IL17A antibody secukinumab (AIN457) has shown promise in Phase II trials in multiple sclerosis. Here, we show that human astrocytes, isolated from a fetal cerebral cortex, express IL17RA and IL17RC and in vitro treatment with IL17A increases protein levels of IL6 in human astrocytes, which is enhanced in the presence of TNFα, as determined by homogeneous time resolved fluorescence. Studies on acutely isolated mouse astrocytes are comparable to human astrocytes although the protein levels of IL6 are lower in mouse astrocytes, which also show a lower response to IL17F and IL1β in promoting IL6 levels. In human astrocytes, IL17A and TNFα also induce mRNA expression of IL6, IL8 and the Th17 cytokines CXCL1, CXCL2, and CCL20, with little effect on Th1 cytokines CXCL9, CXCL10, and CXCL11. The effects of IL17A are associated with nuclear translocation of the NF-κB transcription factor, as determined by immunocytochemistry, where treatment of human astrocytes with the inhibitors of the NF-κB pathway and with secukinumab inhibits the IL17A and IL17A/TNFα-induced increase in nuclear translocation of NF-κB and levels of IL6. Taken together the data shows that IL17A signaling plays a key role in regulating the levels of cytokines, such as IL6, in human astrocytes via a mechanism that involves NF-κB signaling and that selective inhibition of IL17A signaling attenuates levels of pro-inflammatory molecules in astrocytes.

This article discusses the scientific rationale for the use of cytokine inhibitors, including ustekinumab, an inhibitor of the interleukin (IL)-12 and IL-23 pathways in psoriasis. Also addressed are the efficacy and safety data for this agent, as well as for several emerging therapies that target other cytokine pathways in psoriasis: the IL-17 inhibitors secukinumab, ixekizumab, and brodalumab, the IL-23 blocker tildrakizumab, and the small-molecule kinase inhibitors apremilast (a phosphodiesterase-4 blocker) and tofacitinib (a Janus kinase inhibitor).

Anti-cytokine autoantibodies have been widely reported to be present in human plasma, both in healthy subjects and in patients with underlying autoimmune conditions, such as autoimmune polyendocrinopathy candidiasis ectodermal dystrophy (APECED) or thymic epithelial neoplasms. While often asymptomatic, they can cause or facilitate a wide range of diseases including opportunistic infections. The potential therapeutic value of specific neutralizing anti-cytokine autoantibodies has not been thoroughly investigated. Here we used mammalian cell display to isolate IL17A-specific antibodies from a thymoma patient with proven high-titer autoantibodies against the same. We identified 3 distinct clonotypes that efficiently neutralized IL17A in a cell-based in vitro assay. Their potencies were comparable to those of known neutralizing antibodies, including 2, AIN457 (secukinumab) and ixekizumab that are currently in clinical development for the treatment of various inflammatory disorders. These data clearly demonstrate that the human autoantibody repertoire can be mined for antibodies with high therapeutic potential for clinical development.

Psoriasis is a chronic inflammatory skin disorder resulting from a complex network of cytokines and chemokines produced by various immune cell types and tissue cells. Emerging evidence suggests a central role of IL-17 and IL-23/T17 axis in the pathogenesis of psoriasis, giving a rationale for using IL-17-blocking agents as therapeutics. Three agents targeting IL-17 signaling are being studied in Phase III clinical trials: secukinumab and ixekizumab (IL-17 neutralizing agents), and brodalumab (IL-17 receptor antagonist). Preliminary results are highly promising for all anti-IL17 agents, creating fair expectations on this class of agents as the new effective therapeutic approach for the treatment of psoriasis.

Psoriasis is a chronic inflammatory skin disease affecting about 1-3% of the general population. Moderate-to-severe psoriasis is commonly associated with various comorbidities, including psoriatic arthritis (PsA) and cardio-metabolic disorders such as obesity, hypertension, diabetes, and metabolic syndrome. There is increasing recognition that systemic inflammation accompanies severe skin disease. Abnormal innate and adaptive immune responses in the skin are involved in pathogenesis. The cytokine interleukin (IL)-17A is produced by T helper 17 (Th17) cells, neutrophils, mast cells, and T cytotoxic 17 cells. IL-17 plays a key role in host defense against extracellular bacteria and fungi. IL-17A acts on keratinocytes to increase expression of chemokines involved in recruiting myeloid dendritic cells, Th17 cells, and neutrophils to the lesion site. IL-17A also induces the production of antimicrobial peptides and pro-inflammatory cytokines that, in turn, may amplify and sustain immune responses in the skin. Blocking IL-17A improved psoriasis-like pathology in experimental models, and reduction in IL-17 signaling is part of the mechanism of action of tumor necrosis factor-α blockers. Three agents neutralizing IL-17 (i.e., secukinumab and ixekizumab) or antagonizing its receptor (i.e., brodalumab) are currently being tested for efficacy and safety in the treatment of plaque psoriasis and PsA. Secukinumab is a fully human IgG1 monoclonal antibody that selectively binds and neutralizes IL-17A whose efficacy in the therapy of chronic plaque psoriasis has been demonstrated in different phase II clinical trial. No new safety signals have emerged so far.

[PMID: 23106107]
Conventional systemic therapies for plaque psoriasis have not fully met the needs of patients, and although current biologic treatments are generally well tolerated, concerns exist with respect to long-term safety. Interleukin (IL)-17A is believed to be an important effector cytokine in the pathogenesis of psoriasis and is produced by Th17 cells, a class of helper T cells that act outside the established Th1/Th2 paradigm for regulation of innate and adaptive immunity. To assess the efficacy and safety of different doses of secukinumab, a fully human anti-IL-17A IgG1κ monoclonal antibody, in patients with moderate-to-severe plaque psoriasis. Patients (n = 125) were randomized 1 : 1 : 1 : 1 : 1 to receive subcutaneous doses of placebo (n = 22) or secukinumab [1 × 25 mg (n = 29), 3 × 25 mg (n = 26), 3 × 75 mg (n = 21) or 3 × 150 mg (n = 27)] at weeks 0, 4 and 8. After the 12-week treatment period, patients entered a follow-up period of 24 weeks. The primary efficacy outcome was at least 75% improvement from baseline in the Psoriasis Area and Severity Index score (PASI 75); secondary outcomes included the Investigator's Global Assessment (IGA) and PASI 90 and 50 response rates. After 12 weeks of treatment, secukinumab 3 × 150 mg and 3 × 75 mg resulted in significantly higher PASI 75 response rates vs. placebo (82% and 57% vs. 9%; P < 0·001 and P = 0·002, respectively). Higher PASI 75 response rates compared with placebo were maintained throughout the follow-up period with these dosages [week 36, 26% (n = 7) and 19% (n = 4) vs. 4% (n = 1), respectively], with a gradual decline of PASI 75 response over time after the dosing period. IGA response rates were significantly higher in the 3 × 150 mg group vs. placebo at week 12 (48% vs. 9%; P = 0·005) and were consistently higher for the 3 × 150 mg and 3 × 75 mg groups vs. placebo at all time points from week 4 onward. The PASI 90 response rate was significantly higher in the 3 × 150 mg group vs. placebo (52% vs. 5%) at week 12 and remained higher during the follow-up period. Secukinumab was well tolerated. Two cases of neutropenia (≤ grade 2) were reported in the 3 × 150 mg cohort. Treatment with subcutaneous secukinumab 3 × 75 mg and 3 × 150 mg met the primary outcome of PASI 75 response achievement after 12 weeks, demonstrating efficacy in moderate-to-severe psoriasis.

Interleukin (IL)-17A and IL-17E (also known as IL-25) have been implicated in fibrosis in various tissues. However, the role of these cytokines in the development of intestinal strictures in Crohn's disease (CD) has not been explored. We investigated the levels of IL-17A and IL-17E and their receptors in CD strictured and non-strictured gut, and the effects of IL-17A and IL-17E on CD myofibroblasts. IL-17A was significantly overexpressed in strictured compared with non-strictured CD tissues, whereas no significant difference was found in the expression of IL-17E or IL-17A and IL-17E receptors (IL-17RC and IL-17RB, respectively) in strictured and non-strictured CD areas. Strictured CD explants released significantly higher amounts of IL-17A than non-strictured explants, whereas no difference was found as for IL-17E, IL-6, or tumor necrosis factor-α production. IL-17A, but not IL-17E, significantly inhibited myofibroblast migration, and also significantly upregulated matrix metalloproteinase (MMP)-3, MMP-12, tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinase-1 and collagen production by myofibroblasts from strictured CD tissues. Our results suggest that IL-17A, but not IL-17E, is pro-fibrotic in CD. Further studies are needed to clarify whether the therapeutic blockade of IL-17A through the anti-IL-17A monoclonal antibody secukinumab is able to counteract the fibrogenic process in CD.

Secukinumab is a fully human anti-interleukin-17A monoclonal antibody. Determine the efficacy, safety and usability of secukinumab administered via autoinjector/pen. This phase III trial randomized subjects with moderate to severe plaque psoriasis to secukinumab 300 mg, 150 mg or placebo self-injection once weekly to Week 4, then every 4 weeks. Co-primary end points at Week 12 were ≥75% improvement in Psoriasis Area and Severity Index (PASI 75) and clear/almost clear skin by investigator's global assessment 2011 modified version (IGA mod 2011 0/1). Secondary end points included autoinjector usability, assessed by successful, hazard-free self-injection and subject-reported acceptability on Self-Injection Assessment Questionnaire. Week 12 PASI 75 and IGA mod 2011 0/1 responses were superior with secukinumab 300 mg (86.7% and 73.3%, respectively) and 150 mg (71.7% and 53.3%, respectively) vs. placebo (3.3% and 0%, respectively) (P < 0.0001 for all). All subjects successfully self-administered treatment at Week 1, without critical use-related hazards. Subject acceptability of autoinjector was high throughout 12 weeks. Adverse events were higher with secukinumab (300 mg, 70.0%; 150 mg, 63.9%) vs. placebo (54.1%), with differences largely driven by mild/moderate nasopharyngitis. Secukinumab delivered by autoinjector/pen is efficacious, well-tolerated and associated with high usability in moderate to severe plaque psoriasis.

Ankylosing spondylitis is a chronic immune-mediated inflammatory disease characterised by spinal inflammation, progressive spinal rigidity, and peripheral arthritis. Interleukin 17 (IL-17) is thought to be a key inflammatory cytokine in the development of ankylosing spondylitis, the prototypical form of spondyloarthritis. We assessed the efficacy and safety of the anti-IL-17A monoclonal antibody secukinumab in treating patients with active ankylosing spondylitis. We did a randomised double-blind proof-of-concept study at eight centres in Europe (four in Germany, two in the Netherlands, and two in the UK). Patients aged 18-65 years were randomly assigned (in a 4:1 ratio) to either intravenous secukinumab (2×10 mg/kg) or placebo, given 3 weeks apart. Randomisation was done with a computer-generated block randomisation list without a stratification process. The primary efficacy endpoint was the percentage of patients with a 20% response according to the Assessment of SpondyloArthritis international Society criteria for improvement (ASAS20) at week 6 (Bayesian analysis). Safety was assessed up to week 28. This study is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT00809159. 37 patients with moderate-to-severe ankylosing spondylitis were screened, and 30 were randomly assigned to receive either intravenous secukinumab (n=24) or placebo (n=6). The final efficacy analysis included 23 patients receiving secukinumab and six patients receiving placebo, and the safety analysis included all 30 patients. At week 6, ASAS20 response estimates were 59% on secukinumab versus 24% on placebo (99·8% probability that secukinumab is superior to placebo). One serious adverse event (subcutaneous abscess caused by Staphylococcus aureus) occurred in the secukinumab-treated group. Secukinumab rapidly reduced clinical or biological signs of active ankylosing spondylitis and was well tolerated. It is the first targeted therapy that we know of that is an alternative to tumour necrosis factor inhibition to reach its primary endpoint in a phase 2 trial. Novartis.

Secukinumab, a fully human anti-IL-17A monoclonal antibody, neutralizes IL-17A, a key cytokine in the pathogenesis of psoriasis. Efficacy and safety of secukinumab was evaluated in Japanese patients with moderate-to-severe plaque psoriasis as part of a large Phase 3 global study (ERASURE). In this 52-week, double-blind study (ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT01365455, JapicCTI-111529), 87 patients from Japan (11.8% of 738 patients randomized in the overall study population) were equally randomized to receive secukinumab 300 mg or 150 mg, or placebo once weekly at baseline and at Weeks 1, 2, 3 and 4, then every 4 weeks. Co-primary endpoints (Week 12) were ≥75% improvement in psoriasis area-and-severity index (PASI 75) from baseline and a score of 0 (clear) or 1 (almost clear) on a 5-point Investigator's Global Assessment scale (IGA mod 2011 0/1) versus placebo. PASI 75 and IGA mod 2011 0/1 responses at Week 12 were superior with secukinumab 300 mg (82.8% and 55.2%, respectively) or 150 mg (86.2% and 55.2%, respectively) versus placebo (6.9% and 3.4%, respectively; P < 0.0001 for all). Greater than 90% improvement in PASI (PASI 90) was also superior with secukinumab 300 mg (62.1%) or 150 mg (55.2%) versus placebo (0.0%) at Week 12 (P < 0.0001 for both). Clinical responses were sustained up to Week 52 in the majority of patients. During a 12-week induction period, adverse event incidences were 48.3% with secukinumab 300 mg, 55.2% with 150 mg, and 41.4% with placebo. Secukinumab showed robust and sustainable efficacy in symptom reduction for moderate-to-severe plaque psoriasis in the Japanese patients.

To evaluate new psoriasis treatments, clinicians, regulators and pharmaceutical developers require well-accepted, clinically meaningful measures of disease severity. The Psoriasis Area and Severity Index (PASI) score is most widely used as a primary endpoint in clinical trials, although it is not routinely used in clinical practice. Characterize a 5-point Investigator's Global Assessment (IGA) tool and evaluate whether it meets the needs for a valid, clinically meaningful measure. A 5-point IGA tool was developed with input from regulatory authorities and clinical trial investigators involved with psoriasis drug development and evaluation. Associations between IGA 0/1 responder rates and PASI scores were evaluated using data from two phase 2 studies with the anti-interleukin (IL)-17A monoclonal antibody secukinumab (AIN457) that utilized a similar 6-point IGA. The 5-point IGA has a more stringent definition for a score of 1 ("almost clear") compared with 6-point IGA/Physician's Global Assessment (PGA) tools used in previous trials of other biologics in moderate-to-severe psoriasis. Whereas IGA/PGA 0/1 responder rates for earlier scales are strongly associated with PASI 75, the IGA 0/1 rate for the secukinumab 6-point scale was more robust, demonstrating a strong association with PASI 90, and the results for the 5-point IGA are expected to show the same association. The 5-point IGA is a valid measure of disease severity and meets the need for a clinically meaningful measure of success for psoriasis treatment studies.

To evaluate the efficacy and safety of secukinumab, a fully human, anti-interleukin (IL)-17A monoclonal antibody, in patients with psoriatic arthritis (PsA). 42 patients with active PsA fulfilling ClASsification for Psoriatic ARthritis (CASPAR) criteria were randomly assigned (2:1) to receive two intravenous secukinumab doses (10 mg/kg; n=28) or placebo (n=14) 3 weeks apart. The primary endpoint was the proportion of American College of Rheumatology (ACR) 20 responses at week 6 for secukinumab versus placebo (one-sided p<0.1). Primary endpoint: ACR20 responses at week 6 were 39% (9/23) for secukinumab versus 23% (3/13) for placebo (p=0.27). ACR20 responses were greater with secukinumab versus placebo at week 12 (39% (9/23) vs 15% (2/13), p=0.13) and week 24 (43% (10/23) vs 18% (2/11), p= 0.14). At week 6, 'good' European League Against Rheumatism response was seen in 21.7% (5/23) secukinumab versus 9.1% (1/11) placebo patients. Compared with placebo at week 6, significant reductions were observed among secukinumab recipients for C reactive protein (p=0.039), erythrocyte sedimentation rate (p=0.038), Health Assessment Questionnaire Disability Index (p=0.002) and Short Form Health Survey (SF-36; p=0.030) scores. The overall adverse event (AE) frequency was comparable between secukinumab (26 (93%)) and placebo (11 (79%)) recipients. Six serious AEs (SAEs) were reported in four secukinumab patients and one SAE in one placebo patient. Although the primary endpoint was not met, clinical responses, acute-phase reactant and quality of life improvements were greater with secukinumab versus placebo, suggesting some clinical benefit. Secukinumab exhibited satisfactory safety. Larger clinical trials of secukinumab in PsA are warranted.

Various novel therapies for spondyloarthritis (SpA) are currently under development. In this review, we discuss the scientific rational to target the interleukin (IL)-23/IL-17 axis in SpA and give an overview of the proof-of-concept trials with drugs directed towards this axis. Cumulative evidence from genetics (e.g. the strong genetic association with the IL-23 receptor gene), in-vitro models (e.g. the increased IL-23 production upon HLA-B27 misfolding), human expression studies (e.g. the expansion of IL-17 producing innate cells in SpA) and animal models (e.g. the increased IL-17 production in HLA-B27 transgenic rats) strongly supports the involvement of the IL-23/IL-17 axis in the pathogenesis of SpA. Ustekinumab (a monoclonal antibody directed against the common p40 subunit of IL-23 and IL-12), secukinumab, ixekizumab (both monoclonal antibodies directed against IL-17A), and brodalumab a monoclonal antibody against the IL-17RA receptor) have been recently used in proof-of-concept and randomized trials in the ankylosing spondylitis and/or psoriatic arthritis subforms of SpA, with overall very promising clinical efficacy. The first results for novel drugs blocking key cytokines in the IL-23/IL-17 axis are promising in SpA and more novel compounds are upcoming. This will teach us more on the role of the IL-23/IL-17 axis in the pathophysiology of SpA.

To determine the efficacy and safety of different doses of secukinumab, a fully human monoclonal antibody for targeted interleukin-17A blockade, in patients with noninfectious uveitis. Three multicenter, randomized, double-masked, placebo-controlled, dose-ranging phase III studies: SHIELD, INSURE, and ENDURE. A total of 118 patients with Behçet's uveitis (SHIELD study); 31 patients with active, noninfectious, non-Behçet's uveitis (INSURE study); and 125 patients with quiescent, noninfectious, non-Behçet's uveitis (ENDURE study) were enrolled. After an initial subcutaneous (s.c.) loading phase in each treatment arm, patients received s.c. maintenance therapy with secukinumab 300 mg every 2 weeks (q2w), secukinumab 300 mg monthly (q4w), or placebo in the SHIELD study; secukinumab 300 mg q2w, secukinumab 300 mg q4w, secukinumab 150 mg q4w, or placebo in the INSURE study; or secukinumab 300 mg q2w, secukinumab 300 mg q4w, secukinumab 150 mg q4w, or placebo in the ENDURE study. Reduction of uveitis recurrence or vitreous haze score during withdrawal of concomitant immunosuppressive medication (ISM). Other end points included best-corrected visual acuity, ISM use (expressed as a standardized ISM score), and safety outcomes. After completion or early termination of each trial, there were no statistically significant differences in uveitis recurrence between the secukinumab treatment groups and placebo groups in any study. Secukinumab was associated with a significant reduction in mean total post-baseline ISM score (P = 0.019; 300 mg q4w vs. placebo) in the SHIELD study. Likewise, secukinumab was associated with a greater median reduction in ISM score versus placebo in the INSURE study, although no statistical analysis of the difference was conducted because of the small sample size. Overall, there was no loss in visual acuity reported in any treatment group during follow-up in all 3 studies. According to descriptive safety statistics, the frequencies of ocular and nonocular adverse events seemed to be slightly higher among secukinumab groups versus placebo across the 3 studies. The primary efficacy end points of the 3 studies were not met. The secondary efficacy data from these studies suggest a beneficial effect of secukinumab in reducing the use of concomitant ISM.
