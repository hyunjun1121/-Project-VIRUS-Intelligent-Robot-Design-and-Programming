Filgotinib (GS-6034, formerly GLPG0634) is an oral, selective Janus kinase 1 (JAK1) inhibitor that showed early response and sustained efficacy in patients with rheumatoid arthritis and with Crohn's disease. The aim of the present study was to investigate the impact of age and renal impairment (RI) on the pharmacokinetics (PK) of filgotinib and its main metabolite. The effect of age was assessed in two groups of 10 elderly healthy subjects (65-74 and ≥75 years of age) and a control group of 10 younger healthy subjects (40-50 years of age). The impact of RI was investigated in three groups of subjects with mild (n = 6), moderate (n = 6) and severe (n = 3) RI [estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) 60-89, 30-59 and 15-29 ml min<sup>-1</sup> 1.73 m<sup>-2</sup> , respectively] and a control group (n = 9) with normal renal function (eGFR ≥90 ml min<sup>-1</sup> 1.73 m<sup>-2</sup> ). The PK of filgotinib and its metabolite were evaluated following filgotinib 100 mg once-daily doses for 10 days. At steady state, the exposure [area under the concentration-time curve over the dosing interval (AUC<sub>0-24 h</sub> )] of filgotinib and its metabolite was moderately higher (1.45- and 1.33-fold, respectively) in the elderly subjects (≥75 years) compared with younger subjects. Renal clearance for filgotinib and its metabolite decreased with the degree of RI, leading to a maximum increase in AUC<sub>0-24 h</sub> of 1.54-fold for filgotinib and 2.74-fold for the metabolite in subjects with severe RI. Filgotinib was generally safe and well tolerated. Age and mild to moderate impairment of renal function had limited impact on the PK of filgotinib. In subjects with severe RI, the exposure to the metabolite of filgotinib was elevated, consistent with its renal elimination pathway.

The Janus kinase 1 (JAK1) pathway has been implicated in the pathogenesis of psoriatic arthritis. We aimed to investigate the efficacy and safety of filgotinib, a selective JAK1 inhibitor, for the treatment of psoriatic arthritis. The EQUATOR trial was a randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled phase 2 trial that enrolled adults from 25 sites in seven countries (Belgium, Bulgaria, Czech Republic, Estonia, Poland, Spain, and Ukraine). Patients (aged ≥18 years) had active moderate-to-severe psoriatic arthritis (defined as at least five swollen joints and at least five tender joints) fulfilling Classification for psoriatic arthritis (CASPAR) criteria, active or a documented history of plaque psoriasis, and an insufficient response or intolerance to at least one conventional synthetic disease-modifying anti-rheumatic drug (csDMARD). Patients continued to take csDMARDs during the study if they had received this treatment for at least 12 weeks before screening and were on a stable dose for at least 4 weeks before baseline. Using an interactive web-based system, we randomly allocated patients (1:1) to filgotinib 200 mg or placebo orally once daily for 16 weeks (stratified by current use of csDMARDs and previous use of anti-tumour necrosis factor). Patients, study team, and sponsor were masked to treatment assignment. The primary endpoint was proportion of patients achieving 20% improvement in American College of Rheumatology response criteria (ACR20) at week 16 in the full analysis set (patients who received at least one dose of study drug), which was compared between groups with the Cochran-Mantel-Haenszel test and non-responder imputation method. This trial is registered with ClincalTrials.gov, number NCT03101670. Between March 9, and Sept 27, 2017, 191 patients were screened and 131 were randomly allocated to treatment (65 to filgotinib and 66 to placebo). 60 (92%) patients in the filgotinib group and 64 (97%) patients in the placebo group completed the study; five patients (8%) in the filgotinib group and two patients (3%) in the placebo group discontinued treatment. 52 (80%) of 65 patients in the filgotinib group and 22 (33%) of 66 in the placebo group achieved ACR20 at week 16 (treatment difference 47% [95% CI 30·2-59·6], p<0·0001). 37 (57%) patients who received filgotinib and 39 (59%) patients who received placebo had at least one treatment-emergent adverse event. Six participants had an event that was grade 3 or worse. The most common events were nasopharyngitis and headache, occurring at similar proportions in each group. One serious treatment-emergent adverse event was reported in each group (pneumonia and hip fracture after a fall), one of which (pneumonia) was fatal in the filgotinib group. Filgotinib is efficacious for the treatment of active psoriatic arthritis, and no new safety signals were identified. Galapagos and Gilead Sciences.

To evaluate the efficacy and safety of different doses and regimens of filgotinib, an oral Janus kinase 1 inhibitor, as add-on treatment to methotrexate (MTX) in patients with active rheumatoid arthritis (RA) and inadequate response to MTX. In this 24-week phase IIb study, patients with moderate-to-severe active RA receiving a stable dose of MTX were randomised (1:1:1:1:1:1:1) to receive placebo or 50, 100 or 200 mg filgotinib, administered once daily or twice daily. Primary end point was the percentage of patients achieving a week 12 American College of Rheumatology (ACR)20 response. Overall, 594 patients were randomised and treated. At week 12, significantly more patients receiving filgotinib 100 mg once daily or 200 mg daily (both regimens) achieved an ACR20 response versus placebo. For other key end points at week 12 (ACR50, ACR-N, Disease Activity Score based on 28 joints and C reactive protein value, Clinical Disease Activity Index, Simplified Disease Activity Index and Health Assessment Questionnaire-Disability Index), differences in favour of 100  or 200 mg filgotinib daily were seen versus placebo; responses were maintained or improved through to week 24. Rapid onset of action and dose-dependent responses were observed for most efficacy end points and were associated with an increased haemoglobin concentration. No significant differences between once-daily and twice-daily regimens were seen. Treatment-emergent adverse event rates were similar in placebo and filgotinib groups. Serious infections occurred in one and five patients in the placebo and filgotinib groups, respectively. No tuberculosis or opportunistic infections were reported. Filgotinib as add-on to MTX improved the signs and symptoms of active RA over 24 weeks and was associated with a rapid onset of action. Filgotinib was generally well tolerated. NCT01888874.

To evaluate the efficacy and safety of different doses of filgotinib, an oral Janus kinase 1 inhibitor, as monotherapy in patients with active rheumatoid arthritis (RA) and previous inadequate response to methotrexate (MTX). In this 24-week phase IIb study, patients with moderately to severely active RA were randomised (1:1:1:1) to receive 50, 100 or 200 mg filgotinib once daily, or placebo, after a ≥4-week washout from MTX. The primary end point was the percentage of patients achieving an American College of Rheumatology (ACR)20 response at week 12. Overall, 283 patients were randomised and treated. At week 12, significantly more patients receiving filgotinib at any dose achieved ACR20 responses versus placebo (≥65% vs 29%, p<0.001). For other key end points at week 12 (ACR50, ACR70, ACR-N, Disease Activity Score based on 28 joints and C reactive protein, Clinical Disease Activity Index, Simplified Disease Activity Index and Health Assessment Questionnaire-Disability Index) significant differences from baseline in favour of filgotinib 100 and 200 mg versus placebo were seen; responses were maintained or improved through week 24. Rapid onset of action was observed for most efficacy end points. Dose-dependent increases in haemoglobin were observed. The percentage of patients with treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAE) was similar in the placebo and filgotinib groups (∼40%). Eight patients on filgotinib and one on placebo had a serious TEAE, and four patients, all of whom received filgotinib, experienced a serious infection. No tuberculosis or opportunistic infections were reported. Over 24 weeks, filgotinib as monotherapy was efficacious in treating the signs and symptoms of active RA, with a rapid onset of action. Filgotinib was generally well tolerated. NCT01894516.

JAK inhibitors have shown efficacy in rheumatoid arthritis (RA). We undertook this study to test our hypothesis that selective inhibition of JAK-1 would combine good efficacy with a better safety profile compared with less selective JAK inhibitors. In two 4-week exploratory, double-blind, placebo-controlled phase IIa trials, 127 RA patients with an insufficient response to methotrexate (MTX) received filgotinib (GLPG0634, GS-6034) oral capsules (100 mg twice daily or 30, 75, 150, 200, or 300 mg once daily) or placebo, added onto a stable regimen of MTX, to evaluate safety, efficacy, pharmacokinetics (PK), and pharmacodynamics (PD) of filgotinib. The primary efficacy end point was the number and percentage of patients in each treatment group meeting the American College of Rheumatology 20% improvement criteria (achieving an ACR20 response) at week 4. Treatment with filgotinib at 75-300 mg met the primary end point and showed early onset of efficacy. ACR20 response rates progressively increased to week 4, and the Disease Activity Score in 28 joints using the C-reactive protein (CRP) level decreased. Marked and sustained improvements were observed in serum CRP level and other PD markers. The PK of filgotinib and its major metabolite was dose proportional over the 30-300 mg range. Early side effects seen with other less selective JAK inhibitors were not observed (e.g., there was no worsening of anemia [JAK-2 inhibition related], no effects on liver transaminases, and no increase in low-density lipoprotein or total cholesterol). A limited decrease in neutrophils without neutropenia was consistent with immunomodulatory effects through JAK-1 inhibition. There were no infections. Overall, filgotinib was well tolerated. Events related to study drug were mild or moderate and transient during therapy, and the most common such event was nausea. Selective inhibition of JAK-1 with filgotinib shows initial efficacy in RA with an encouraging safety profile in these exploratory studies.

At present, biological disease-modifying anti-rheumatic drugs (DMARDs) are the only treatment recommended for patients with ankylosing spondylitis who have not responded to first-line treatment with non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs). The TORTUGA trial investigated the efficacy and safety of filgotinib, an oral selective Janus kinase 1 (JAK1) inhibitor, for the treatment of patients with active ankylosing spondylitis. In this completed, randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled, phase 2 trial, we enrolled adult patients from 30 sites in seven countries (Belgium, Bulgaria, Czech Republic, Estonia, Poland, Spain, and Ukraine). Eligible patients had active ankylosing spondylitis and an inadequate response or intolerance to two or more NSAIDs. Patients were randomly assigned (1:1) with an interactive web-based response system to receive filgotinib 200 mg or placebo orally once daily for 12 weeks. Randomisation was stratified by current use of conventional synthetic DMARDs and previous receipt of anti-tumour necrosis factor therapy. The patients, study team, and study sponsor were masked to treatment assignment. The primary endpoint was the change from baseline in ankylosing spondylitis disease activity score (ASDAS) at week 12, which was assessed in the full analysis set (ie, all randomised patients who received at least one dose of study drug). Safety was assessed according to actual treatment received. This trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT03117270. Between March 7, 2017, and July 2, 2018, 263 patients were screened and 116 randomly assigned to filgotinib (n=58) or placebo (n=58). 55 (95%) patients in the filgotinib group and 52 (90%) in the placebo group completed the study; three (5%) patients in the filgotinib group and six (10%) in the placebo group discontinued treatment. The mean ASDAS change from baseline to week 12 was -1·47 (SD 1·04) in the filgotinib group and -0·57 (0·82) in the placebo group, with a least squares mean difference between groups of -0·85 (95% CI -1·17 to -0·53; p<0·0001). Treatment-emergent adverse events were reported in 18 patients in each group, the most common being nasopharyngitis (in two patients in the filgotinib group and in four patients in the placebo group). Treatment-emergent adverse events led to permanent treatment discontinuation in two patients (a case of grade 3 pneumonia in the filgotinib group and of high creatine kinase in the placebo group). No deaths were reported during the study. Filgotinib is efficacious and safe for the treatment of patients with active ankylosing spondylitis who have not responded to first-line pharmacological therapy with NSAIDs. Further investigation of filgotinib for ankylosing spondylitis is warranted. Galapagos and Gilead Sciences.

Filgotinib (GLPG0634, GS-6034) is a once-daily, orally administered, Janus kinase 1 (JAK1)-selective inhibitor. The FITZROY study examined the efficacy and safety of filgotinib for the treatment of moderate-to-severe Crohn's disease. We did a randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled phase 2 study, which recruited patients from 52 centres in nine European countries. We enrolled eligible patients aged 18-75 years with a documented history of ileal, colonic, or ileocolonic Crohn's disease for 3 months or more before screening, as assessed by colonoscopy and supported by histology, and a Crohn's Disease Activity Index (CDAI) score during screening between 220 and 450 inclusive. Patients were randomly assigned (3:1) to receive filgotinib 200 mg once a day or placebo for 10 weeks. Patients were stratified according to previous anti-tumour necrosis factor alpha exposure, C-reactive protein concentration at screening (≤10 mg/L or >10 mg/L), and oral corticosteroid use at baseline, using an interactive web-based response system. The primary endpoint was clinical remission, defined as CDAI less than 150 at week 10. After week 10, patients were assigned based on responder status to filgotinib 100 mg once a day, filgotinib 200 mg once a day, or placebo for an observational period lasting a further 10 weeks. The filgotinib and placebo treatment groups were compared using ANCOVA models and logistic regression models containing baseline values and randomisation stratification factors as fixed effects. Analyses were done on the intention-to-treat non-responder imputation set. The trial was registered at ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT02048618. Between Feb 3, 2014, and July 10, 2015, we enrolled 174 patients with active Crohn's disease confirmed by centrally read endoscopy (130 in the filgotinib 200 mg group and 44 in the placebo group). In the intention-to-treat population, 60 (47%) of 128 patients treated with filgotinib 200 mg achieved clinical remission at week 10 versus ten (23%) of 44 patients treated with placebo (difference 24 percentage points [95% CI 9-39], p=0·0077). In a pooled analysis of all periods of filgotinib and placebo exposure over 20 weeks, serious treatment-emergent adverse effects were reported in 14 (9%) of 152 patients treated with filgotinib and three (4%) of 67 patients treated with placebo. Filgotinib induced clinical remission in significantly more patients with active Crohn's disease compared with placebo, and had an acceptable safety profile. Galapagos.

Filgotinib (GLPG0634) is a selective inhibitor of Janus kinase 1 (JAK1) currently in development for the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis and Crohn's disease. While less selective JAK inhibitors have shown long-term efficacy in treating inflammatory conditions, this was accompanied by dose-limiting side effects. Here, we describe the pharmacokinetics of filgotinib and its active metabolite in healthy volunteers and the use of pharmacokinetic-pharmacodynamic modeling and simulation to support dose selection for phase IIB in patients with rheumatoid arthritis. Two trials were conducted in healthy male volunteers. In the first trial, filgotinib was administered as single doses from 10 mg up to multiple daily doses of 200 mg. In the second trial, daily doses of 300 and 450 mg for 10 days were evaluated. Non-compartmental analysis was used to determine individual pharmacokinetic parameters for filgotinib and its metabolite. The overall pharmacodynamic activity for the two moieties was assessed in whole blood using interleukin-6-induced phosphorylation of signal-transducer and activator of transcription 1 as a biomarker for JAK1 activity. These data were used to conduct non-linear mixed-effects modeling to investigate a pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic relationship. Modeling and simulation on the basis of early clinical data suggest that the pharmacokinetics of filgotinib are dose proportional up to 200 mg, in agreement with observed data, and support that both filgotinib and its metabolite contribute to its pharmacodynamic effects. Simulation of biomarker response supports that the maximum pharmacodynamic effect is reached at a daily dose of 200 mg filgotinib. Based on these results, a daily dose range up to 200 mg has been selected for phase IIB dose-finding studies in patients with rheumatoid arthritis.

Biologics were the first targeted therapies for rheumatoid arthritis (RA), having in common high clinical efficacy. Being proteins, they are administered parenterally. The first oral targeted small molecules approved for RA are competitive inhibitors of the Janus kinase (JAK) enzyme family which mediate signalling for a cytokine subset important in RA pathogenesis. Areas covered: Several JAK inhibitors have been developed with differing selectivity for the four JAK enzymes with a view to generating oral, multi-cytokine inhibitors. Here we review the pharmacology and clinical trial data for efficacy and safety of filgotinib, an investigational selective JAK1 inhibitor. We contextualise the contemporary approach to RA management and substantial unmet needs that remain. Expert opinion: The selectivity of filgotinib for JAK1 may have theoretical advantages in terms of limiting toxicity. However, establishing whether this is so before larger numbers of patients are exposed in phase III and beyond in the real word setting, will be difficult. Filgotinib clinical trial data to date has been encouraging with rapid, sustained efficacy with promising safety and tolerability. We are likely to see an expanding choice of approved JAK inhibitors in the clinic but it may not be straightforward to distinguish safety and efficacy differences.

The aim was to assess patient-reported outcomes (PROs) in patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA) treated with filgotinib during two phase 2b, 24-week, randomized, placebo-controlled studies. Patients with moderate-to-severe active RA and an inadequate response to methotrexate (MTX) were randomized to daily placebo or filgotinib 50 mg, 100 mg, or 200 mg as add-on therapy to MTX (NCT01888874) or as monotherapy (NCT01894516). At week 12, nonresponders receiving filgotinib 50 mg in both studies or placebo in the add-on study, and all patients receiving placebo as monotherapy, were re-assigned to filgotinib 100 mg. PROs were measured using the Health Assessment Questionnaire - Disability Index (HAQ-DI) including Patient Pain assessed by visual analog scale, and the Patient Global Assessment of Disease Activity (Patient Global), the Functional Assessment of Chronic Illness Therapy (FACIT)-Fatigue Scale (Version 4), and the 36-Item Short Form Health Survey (SF-36). At week 12, improvements in all PROs, apart from the SF-36 mental component in the add-on study, were statistically better with filgotinib than placebo; some improvements were noted as early as the first assessment time point (week 1 or week 4). Filgotinib improved HAQ-DI by 0.58-0.84 points, FACIT-Fatigue by 6.9-11.4 points, Patient Global by 25.2-35.6 mm, and Pain by 24.2-37.9 mm; scores were maintained or improved to week 24. Across all PROs, more patients achieved minimal clinically important differences and normative values with filgotinib 200 mg than placebo. Patients re-assigned to filgotinib 100 mg at week 12 experienced improvements in PROs between weeks 12 to 24. Filgotinib as MTX add-on therapy or as monotherapy demonstrated rapid and sustained (to 24 weeks) improvements in health-related quality of life and functional status in patients with active RA. MTX add-on study: ClinicalTrials.gov , NCT01888874 . Registered on 28 June 2013. Monotherapy study: ClinicalTrials.gov , NCT01894516 . Registered on 10 July 2013.

The selective Janus kinase 1 inhibitor filgotinib (GLPG0634), which is currently in clinical development for the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis (RA) and Crohn's disease, demonstrated encouraging safety and efficacy profiles in RA patients after 4 weeks of daily dosing. As RA patients might be treated with multiple medications simultaneously, possible drug-drug interactions of filgotinib with cytochrome P450 enzymes and with key drug transporters were evaluated in vitro and in clinical studies. The enzymes involved in filgotinib's metabolism and the potential interactions of the parent and its active major metabolite with drug-metabolizing enzymes and drug transporters, were identified using recombinant enzymes, human microsomes, and cell systems. Furthermore, filgotinib's interaction potential with CYP3A4 was examined in an open-label study in healthy volunteers, which evaluated the impact of filgotinib co-administration on the CYP3A4-sensitive substrate midazolam. The potential interaction with the common RA drug methotrexate was investigated in a clinical study in RA patients. In vitro, filgotinib and its active metabolite at clinically relevant concentrations did not interact with cytochrome P450 enzymes and uridine 5'-diphospho-glucuronosyltransferases, and did not inhibit key drug transporters. In the clinic, a lack of relevant pharmacokinetic drug interactions by filgotinib and its active metabolite with substrates of CYP3A4, as well as with organic anion transporters involved in methotrexate elimination were found. the collective in vivo and in vitro data on drug-metabolizing enzymes and on key drug transporters, support co-administration of filgotinib with commonly used RA drugs to patients without the need for dose adjustments.
