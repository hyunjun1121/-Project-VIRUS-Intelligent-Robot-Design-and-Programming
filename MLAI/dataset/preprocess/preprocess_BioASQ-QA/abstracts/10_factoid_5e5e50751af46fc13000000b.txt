Retapamulin is the first agent in the new pleuromutilin class of antibacterials to become commercially available for clinical use in humans. Retapamulin acts as a potent inhibitor of bacterial protein synthesis and has a unique mode of antibiotic action. To date, retapamulin has not demonstrated any clinically relevant, target-specific crossresistance with other antibiotic classes, and has shown a low potential for resistance selection in vitro. In preclinical studies, retapamulin demonstrated pronounced in vitro activity against staphylococcal, streptococcal and anaerobic Gram-positive clinical isolates associated with skin and skin structure infections. Clinical pharmacology studies showed low systemic exposure with topical use of retapamulin, and a favorable tolerability profile. In clinical efficacy trials involving pediatric and adult patients who received retapamulin twice daily for five days, retapamulin was highly effective in the treatment of impetigo, secondarily infected traumatic lesions and secondarily infected dermatitis. Further, the clinical efficacy and safety profile of retapamulin was comparable to that of commonly used oral and topical antibiotics. Retapamulin was also clinically effective against isolates resistant to existing therapies. As a 1% ointment, retapamulin has been approved in the United States for the treatment of impetigo and in Europe for the shortterm treatment of impetigo and infected small lacerations, abrasions and sutured wounds.

Retapamulin is a novel semisynthetic pleuromutilin antibiotic specifically designed for use as a topical agent. The unique mode of action by which retapamulin selectively inhibits bacterial protein synthesis differentiates it from other nonpleuromutilin antibacterial agents that target the ribosome or ribosomal factors, minimizing the potential for target-specific cross-resistance with other antibacterial classes in current use. In vitro studies show that retapamulin has high potency against the Gram-positive bacteria (Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus pyogenes, and coagulase-negative staphylococci) commonly found in skin and skin-structure infections (SSSIs), including S. aureus strains with resistance to agents such as macrolides, fusidic acid, or mupirocin, and other less common organisms associated with SSSIs, anaerobes, and common respiratory tract pathogens. Clinical studies have shown that twice-daily topical retapamulin for 5 days is comparable to 10 days of oral cephalexin in the treatment of secondarily infected traumatic lesions. A 1% concentration of retapamulin ointment has been approved for clinical use as an easily applied treatment with a short, convenient dosing regimen for impetigo. Given the novel mode of action, low potential for cross-resistance with established antibacterial agents, and high in vitro potency against many bacterial pathogens commonly recovered from SSSIs, retapamulin is a valuable enhancement over existing therapeutic options.

Patients with atopic dermatitis (AD) are known to have a predisposition to colonization or infection by microbial organisms, including both Staphylococcus aureus and herpes simplex virus (HSV). S aureus infection leads to exacerbation of eczema and may induce flares in atopic skin by mediating inflammation. Retapamulin 1% ointment is a unique topical antibiotic formulation that may be a suitable option for the treatment of clinically infected AD. A single-center, open-label pilot study was conducted to investigate the efficacy and safety of retapamulin 1% (Altabax, Stiefel/ GlaxoSmithKline) ointment for the treatment of secondarily infected atopic dermatitis in subjects aged 9 months to 98 years old (n=29). Twice-daily application of retapamulin 1% produced a mean 8.1-point reduction from baseline in the mean Skin Infection Rating Scale score. The majority of subjects achieved clinical cure with topical retapamulin therapy. Retapamulin 1% ointment was effective against S aureus isolates, including methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA). Treatment was well tolerated. Retapamulin 1% is effective for the treatment of atopic dermatitis infected with S aureus, and demonstrates efficacy against both methicillin-susceptible and methicillin-resistant strains. Given its efficacy and good tolerability in this pilot study, retapamulin 1% ointment should be further evaluated as a treatment for infected atopic dermatitis. It may provide convenience and efficacy with a low risk for development of bacterial resistance.

Impetigo is a common childhood skin infection. There are reports of increasing drug resistance to the currently used topical antibiotics including fusidic acid and mupirocin. Retapamulin is a newer topical agent of pleuromutilin class approved by the Food and Drug Administration for treatment of impetigo in children and has been recently made available in the Indian market. It has been demonstrated to have low potential for the development of antibacterial resistance and a high degree of potency against poly drug resistant Gram-positive bacteria found in skin infections including Staphylococcus aureus strains. The drug is safe owing to low systemic absorption and has only minimal side-effect of local irritation at the site of application.

Invasive infections due to <i>Staphylococcus aureus</i>, including methicillin-resistant <i>S. aureus</i> are prevalent and life-threatening. Combinations of antibiotic therapy have been employed in many clinical settings for improving therapeutic efficacy, reducing side effects of drugs, and development of antibiotic resistance. Pleuromutilins have a potential to be developed as a new class of antibiotics for systemic use in humans. In the current study, we investigated the relationship between pleuromutilins, including valnemulin, tiamulin, and retapamulin, and 13 other antibiotics representing different mechanisms of action, against methicillin-susceptible and -resistant <i>S. aureus</i> both <i>in vitro</i> and in an experimental <i>Galleria mellonella</i> model. <i>In vitro</i> synergistic effects were observed in combination of all three study pleuromutilins with tetracycline (TET) by standard checkerboard and/or time-kill assays. In addition, the combination of pleuromutilins with ciprofloxacin or enrofloxacin showed antagonistic effects, while the rest combinations presented indifferent effects. Importantly, all study pleuromutilins in combination with TET significantly enhanced survival rates as compared to the single drug treatment in the <i>G. mellonella</i> model caused by <i>S. aureus</i> strains. Taken together, these results demonstrated synergy effects between pleuromutilins and TET against <i>S. aureus</i> both <i>in vitro</i> and <i>in vivo</i>.

Retapamulin is a semisynthetic pleuromutilin compound with in vitroactivity against Gram-positive bacteria, no cross-resistance to other classes of antimicrobial agents in current use and a low potential for development of resistance. A 1% ointment formulation has been developed for clinical use, and a placebo-controlled trial of impetigo in 210 patients produced significantly higher rates of clinical and microbiological success compared with placebo - 85.6 versus 52.1% and 91.2 versus 50.9%, respectively. Additional comparative studies in over 1900 patients showed noninferiority to topical fusidic acid and oral cephalexin and a low frequency of adverse events. In 2007, retapamulin was approved in the USA for topical treatment of impetigo caused by Streptococcus pyogenes and methicillin-susceptible Staphylococcus aureus, and in the EU for topical treatment of impetigo and infected wounds caused by S. pyogenes and S. aureus, with approvals including adults and children over 9 months of age.

Retapamulin is the first agent of the pleuromutilin class formulated as a topical antibacterial for treating skin infections. The aim of this study was to determine the antimicrobial activity of retapamulin by determining the minimal inhibitory concentration (MIC) values of this new drug and comparators against a wide range of anaerobic bacteria of human origin. The in vitro activity of retapamulin and six comparators (amoxicillin, amoxicillin/clavulanic acid, ceftriaxone, imipenem, clindamycin and metronidazole) was evaluated against 232 anaerobic clinical isolates. MICs were determined by the CLSI reference agar dilution method (M11-A6). Ceftriaxone, clindamycin and amoxicillin/clavulanic acid resistance rates were 54%, 42% and 9.6%, respectively, within the Bacteroides fragilis group. Despite high resistance rates to various antibiotics, retapamulin inhibited 37/52 (71%) strains of the B. fragilis group and 85/87 (98%) of the other Gram-negative bacilli at a concentration of 2 mg/L or less. All the investigated strains of Clostridium perfringens were inhibited by 1 mg/L retapamulin. Three strains of C. difficile and one strain of C. clostridioforme demonstrated decreased susceptibility to retapamulin. Based on inhibitory concentrations, retapamulin was more active than clindamycin, metronidazole and ceftriaxone against Propionibacterium acnes and anaerobic Gram-positive cocci, as all isolates were inhibited by <or=2 mg/L. At <or=2 mg/L, retapamulin inhibited 90% of all 232 anaerobes tested, whereas overall resistance rates for the comparators were as follows: co-amoxiclav, 2%; metronidazole, 12%; clindamycin, 15% and ceftriaxone, 20%. The broad anaerobic spectrum demonstrated by retapamulin in vitro is attractive. Pending further clinical investigation, retapamulin may offer an alternative treatment for anaerobic skin infections in this era of increasing resistance.

Impetigo is a common skin infection, primarily caused by Staphylococcus aureus and mainly occurring in children. It is usually treated topically with antibiotics to achieve a quick cure and prevent spread of the infection. Worldwide, resistance rates of S. aureus against commonly used antibiotics are rising. Retapamulin belongs to a newly developed class of antibiotics for the treatment of uncomplicated skin infections. Our aim was to compare the efficacy and safety of topical application of retapamulin ointment with topical placebo ointment in the treatment of primary impetigo. In a randomized, double-blind, multicentre study, patients received either topical retapamulin ointment 1% twice daily for 5 days or topical placebo. Patients were enrolled into the study for 14 days and attended the clinic for three visits during which clinical and laboratory evaluations were performed. Two hundred and thirteen patients were randomized, with 139 evaluable patients in the retapamulin group and 71 in the placebo group. Based on the primary efficacy endpoint of clinical response after 7 days (intention to treat), retapamulin ointment was superior to placebo (success rate 85.6% vs. 52.1%; P<0.0001). Similar results were found in the per protocol analysis and in the subgroup of patients who had a pathogen isolated at baseline. The most common adverse effect, pruritus at the application site, was reported by 6% and 1% of patients in the retapamulin and placebo groups, respectively. This study shows that topical retapamulin is effective and safe in the treatment of primary impetigo, offering a new treatment option.

Retapamulin is a semisynthetic pleuromutilin derivative being developed as a topical antibiotic for treating bacterial infections of the skin. It is potent in vitro against susceptible and multidrug-resistant organisms commonly associated with bacterial skin infections. We report detailed mode of action studies demonstrating that retapamulin binds to the bacterial ribosome with high affinity, inhibits ribosomal peptidyl transferase activity, and partially inhibits the binding of the initiator tRNA substrate to the ribosomal P-site. Taken together, these data distinguish the mode of action of retapamulin from that of other classes of antibiotics. This unique mode of action may explain the lack of clinically relevant, target-specific cross-resistance of retapamulin with antibacterials in current use.

Novel approaches for the treatment of multidrug-resistant Gram-negative bacterial infections are urgently required. One approach is to potentiate the efficacy of existing antibiotics whose spectrum of activity is limited by the permeability barrier presented by the Gram-negative outer membrane. Cationic peptides derived from polymyxin B have been used to permeabilize the outer membrane, granting antibiotics that would otherwise be excluded access to their targets. We assessed the <i>in vitro</i> efficacies of combinations of SPR741 with conventional antibiotics against <i>Escherichia coli</i>, <i>Klebsiella pneumoniae</i>, and <i>Acinetobacter baumannii</i> Of 35 antibiotics tested, the MICs of 8 of them were reduced 32- to 8,000-fold against <i>E. coli</i> and <i>K. pneumoniae</i> in the presence of SPR741. The eight antibiotics, azithromycin, clarithromycin, erythromycin, fusidic acid, mupirocin, retapamulin, rifampin, and telithromycin, had diverse targets and mechanisms of action. Against <i>A. baumannii</i>, similar potentiation was achieved with clarithromycin, erythromycin, fusidic acid, retapamulin, and rifampin. Susceptibility testing of the most effective antibiotic-SPR741 combinations was extended to 25 additional multidrug-resistant or clinical isolates of <i>E. coli</i> and <i>K. pneumoniae</i> and 17 additional <i>A. baumannii</i> isolates in order to rank the potentiated antibiotics. SPR741 was also able to potentiate antibiotics that are substrates of the AcrAB-TolC efflux pump in <i>E. coli</i>, effectively circumventing the contribution of this pump to intrinsic antibiotic resistance. These studies support the further development of SPR741 in combination with conventional antibiotics for the treatment of Gram-negative bacterial infections.
