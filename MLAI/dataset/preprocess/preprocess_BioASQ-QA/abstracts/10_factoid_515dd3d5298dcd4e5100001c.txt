The short-term hemodynamic effects of intravenous enalaprilat were assessed in 26 infants and children, aged 6 months to 15 years, with intracardiac shunts undergoing cardiac catheterization. Pulmonary and systemic pressure, flow, and resistance indices were measured by the direct Fick method before and 30 min after enalaprilat at 0.06 mg/kg. Aortic and pulmonary artery pressure decreased 15 and 20%, respectively, by 10 min, with little further change at 30 min. The heart rate did not change significantly and there was no reduction in systemic flow. In those with a large ventricular septal defect and normal or near-normal pulmonary resistance (less than 3.5 u.m2, n = 8), the mean pulmonary-systemic flow ratio decreased from 2.9 +/- 0.3 to 2.4 +/- 0.3 (p less than 0.05) and the mean left-to-right shunt from 7.4 +/- 0.8 to 5.9 +/- 0.7 L/min/m2 (p less than 0.02). Those with an elevated pulmonary vascular resistance (greater than 5 u.m2, n = 8) showed a varied response. Two children, both with Down's syndrome, an atrioventricular canal defect, and reversible pulmonary hypertension (as assessed by an infusion of isoproterenol), had no decrease in pulmonary vascular resistance with enalaprilat. There were no adverse effects. Converting enzyme inhibitors may benefit "heart failure" associated with large ventricular septal defects and normal or mildly elevated pulmonary resistance.

Potassium chloride (KCl) supplementation is common among critically ill children. Intravenous (IV) KCl supplementation for pediatric patients is poorly characterized. This study aimed to examine the efficacy and safety of IV KCL and to determine factors affecting patient responses to IV KCL in the pediatric cardiac intensive care unit (CICU). A retrospective review of 211 children (794 KCl doses) undergoing cardiac surgery or a hospital stay for heart failure in the CICU of a tertiary care teaching and referral children's hospital in 2011 was performed. Demographic data, weight, height, creatinine, and concomitant medications during each KCl dose were recorded and analyzed. Body surface area (BSA), creatinine clearance, and change in [K(+)] were calculated. The median age of the children was 4 months (range, 10 days-18 years). In this study, 151 KCl doses were administered to neonates (19 %), 307 doses (39 %) to females, and 510 doses (64 %) to patients with a BSA smaller than 0.33 m(2) (a group with relative renal insufficiency). The mean KCl dose was 0.97 ± 0.006 mEq/kg. No adverse events were associated with IV KCl administration. Blood/plasma [K(+)] increased 0.8 ± 0.02 mEq/L. The responses to KCl did not differ significantly between males and females, between neonates and children, or between patients with a BSA smaller than 0.33 m(2) and those with a BSA of 0.33 m(2) or larger. The responses to IV KCl were attenuated by concomitant furosemide (p = 0.01), amphotericin B (p < 0.01), and KCl in parenteral nutrition (p < 0.01). The responses were augmented by concomitant enalapril (p = 0.03), ethacrynic acid (p < 0.001), and hemodialysis (p < 0.01). Intravenous KCl can be administered safely for CICU patients. Responses to KCl are altered when it is given with certain medications. Intravenous KCl should be used cautiously in children receiving angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors. Future studies are needed for further characterization of factors affecting responses to IV KCl in children.

In a tertiary referral centre 63 patients underwent 67 treatment periods with enalapril. The median age was 5.4 months. All children had signs of heart failure: congestive cardiac failure with breathlessness at rest was present in 88%. Haemodynamic groups were left-to-right shunt (n = 15), impaired ventricular function (n = 14), after cardiac surgery (n = 23), valvar regurgitation (n = 12), and hypertension (n = 3). Serial clinical, radiological, and laboratory data were used to judge outcome. The mean (SD) maximal dose was 0.30 (0.21) mg/kg/day. Thirty nine (58%) patients improved, 20 (30%) showed no improvement, and eight (12%) had side effects requiring discontinuation of enalapril. Renal failure in eight patients was related to young age, low weight, and left-to-right shunt group. Three patients died in congestive heart failure with renal failure. Enalapril was clinically safe and effective for children with cardiac failure secondary to ventricular impairment, valvar regurgitation, or after cardiac surgery. Renal failure was a problem in young infants with left-to-right shunts.

Patients with intraatrial baffle procedure for transposition of the great arteries (TGA) have diastolic dysfunction, decreased exercise capacity, stroke volume response and elevated systemic vascular resistance (SVR) during exercise. Angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors improve exercise capacity in adults with congestive heart failure by improving diastolic function and decreasing SVR. We tested the hypothesis that ACE inhibitors decrease SVR and improve exercise capacity in patients after intraatrial baffle procedure for TGA. We studied the effects of enalapril in nine patients with TGA s/p intraatrial switch (mean age, 13.8 +/- 3 years) 7 to 21 years (mean, 12 +/- 4 years) after intraatrial baffle procedure. Enalapril (0.5 mg/kg/day, maximum dosage 20 mg bid) was administered for 12 months. Patients exercised using a cycle ergometer ramp protocol (0.25 W/kg/min) before enalapril (baseline), 1 month, 6 months, and 12 months after treatment initiation. Heart rate, blood pressure, cardiac output, respiratory rate, minute ventilation, oxygen consumption (VO2), total exercise time, work, and power were measured. SVR, cardiac index, and stroke volume index (SVI) were calculated. Two-tailed paired Student's t-test was used to compare data to those of normal control patients and the patients' baseline data. Patients had lower resting heart rate, cardiac index, maximum heart rate, cardiac index (CI), SVI, VO2, exercise time, work, and power and higher maximal SVR at baseline compared to normal control patients. There was no significant difference in total exercise time, work, power, VO2 (rest/peak), SVR, SVI, and CI after 12 months of therapy compared to patients' baseline values. We conclude that short-term (<1 year) use of enalapril does not improve exercise performance in patients with TGA in whom the intraatrial baffle procedure has been performed.

Angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors improve exercise capacity in adults with congestive heart failure by decreasing systemic vascular resistance and improving ventricular diastolic function. Patients who have undergone the Fontan procedure have decreased cardiac output, increased systemic vascular resistance, abnormal diastolic function, and decreased exercise capacity compared with normal people. To test the hypothesis that afterload reduction therapy alters hemodynamic variables and augments exercise capacity in patients after a Fontan procedure, we compared the results of graded exercise with maximal effort from 18 subjects (14.5+/-6.2 years of age, 4 to 19 years after Fontan procedure) in a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled crossover trial using enalapril (0.2 to 0.3 mg x kg[-1] x d[-1], maximum 15 mg). Each treatment was administered for 10 weeks. Diastolic filling patterns at rest were assessed by Doppler determination of the systemic atrioventricular valve flow velocity at the conclusion of each therapy. No difference was detected in resting heart rate, blood pressure, or cardiac index. Diastolic filling patterns were also similar. Exercise duration was not different (6.4+/-2.6 [enalapril] versus 6.7+/-2.6 minutes [placebo]). The mean percent increase in cardiac index from rest to maximum exercise was slightly but significantly decreased in subjects after 10 weeks of enalapril therapy (102+/-34% [enalapril] versus 125+/-34% [placebo]; P<.02). At maximal exercise, cardiac index (3.5+/-0.9 [enalapril] versus 3.8+/-0.9 L x min[-1] x m2 [placebo]), oxygen consumption (18.3+/-9 [enalapril] versus 20.5+/-7 mL x min[-1] x kg[-1] [placebo]), minute ventilation (57.5+/-17 [enalapril] versus 55.4+/-19 L/min [placebo]), and total work (247+/-181 [enalapril] versus 261+/-197 W [placebo]) were not different. We conclude that enalapril administration for 10 weeks does not alter abnormal systemic vascular resistance, resting cardiac index, diastolic function, or exercise capacity in patients who have undergone a Fontan procedure.

The physiatrist can now be instrumental in prolonging the survival of individuals with neuromuscular disease by using respiratory muscle aids. As a result, morbidity and mortality from cardiomyopathy are likely to increase for patients with generalized myopathies. One hundred consecutive patients with dystrophin-deficient muscular dystrophy and a mean age of 17.2 yr (range, 5-41) satisfied criteria for having dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM) and received digitalis and diuretics. Nine of the 14 patients were symptom-free, despite left ventricular ejection fractions (LVEFs) of 25-40%. The five patients with symptomatic heart failure had severe ventricular dilatation, with LVEFs < 25%. Two of the five patients died of heart failure within 1 yr. For the remaining three patients, we evaluated the addition of the angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor enalapril and, subsequently, the use of beta-blockers to the therapeutic regimen. Addition of these medications, never before attempted in the management of cardiomyopathy associated with generalized myopathic disease, complemented each other in relieving symptoms and reversing signs of congestive heart failure and DCM. We conclude that the combination of ACE inhibitor and beta-blocker deserves further exploration for inclusion in any management regimen for the treatment of muscular dystrophy-associated cardiomyopathy.

We studied the inhibition of angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) in eight infants with congestive heart failure (CHF) poorly controlled with digoxin and diuretics, treated orally with 0.25 mg kg-1 enalapril maleate once a day. Baseline ACE activities were compared between these infants and control children without CHF or ACE inhibitor. Except for one infant who vomited, inhibition of ACE activity was 75.5 +/- 12.2%, 75.5 +/- 10.5% and 51.7 +/- 12.2%, at 4, 12 and 24 h after drug intake respectively. There was no correlation between postnatal age and inhibition of ACE activity. In infants with CHF, mean baseline ACE activity was significantly higher than in control infants (36.4 +/- 7.2 mu ml-1 vs 26.9 +/- 6.9 mu ml-1, P < 0.05). These results were very similar to those seen in adults.

To determine whether an angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor, enalapril, prevents cardiac function deterioration (defined using maximal cardiac index [MCI] on exercise testing or increase in left ventricular end-systolic wall stress [LVESWS]) in long-term survivors of pediatric cancer. This was a randomized, double-blind, controlled clinical trial comparing enalapril to placebo in 135 long-term survivors of pediatric cancer who had at least one cardiac abnormality identified at any time after anthracycline exposure. There was no difference in the rate of change in MCI per year between enalapril and placebo groups (0.30 v 0.18 L/min/m(2); P =.55). However, during the first year of treatment, the rate of change in LVESWS was greater in the enalapril group than in the placebo group (-8.59 v 1.85 g/cm(2); P =.033) and this difference was maintained over the study period, resulting in a 9% reduction in estimated LVESWS by year 5 in the enalapril group. Six of seven patients removed from random assignment to treatment because of cardiac deterioration were initially treated with placebo (P =.11), and one has died as a result of heart failure. Side effects from enalapril included dizziness or hypotension (22% v 3% in the placebo group; P =.0003) and fatigue (10% v 0%; P =.013). Enalapril treatment did not influence exercise performance, but did reduce LVESWS in the first year; this reduction was maintained over the study period. Any theoretical benefits of LVESWS reduction in this anthracycline-exposed population must be weighed against potential side effects from ACE inhibitors when making treatment decisions.

Angiotensin convertase inhibitor (Enalapril) was used in 51 children aged 4 days up to 18 years (mean 4.3 +/- 5.5, years). As many as 27 subjects were newborns (4) and infants (23). The patients suffered from circulatory insufficiency due to congestive cardiomyopathy (13 cases). 6 treated subjects suffered from circulatory insufficiency due to congenital heart malformations before cardiac surgery and 22 after it (including complex malformations operated according to Fontan method). 10 children were treated because of arterial hypertension. 4 subjects suffered form life-threatening arrhythmias coexisting with circulatory insufficiency. (These subjects were already mentioned among the patients suffering from circulatory insufficiency). Enalapril (mainly as a drug named Benalapril) was used in the mean dose of 0.21 mg/kg of body mass daily. 4 patients (8%) died during treatment but their deaths can not be related to angiotensin convertase inhibitor therapy. In the other children (82%) the beneficial influence of angiotensin convertase inhibitor use was found (improvement in comparison with the state before convertase inhibitor introduction). In 10% of subjects enalapril did not show any significant therapeutic effect. According to authors' opinion enalapril use is exceptionally profitable in the subjects surgically treated for complex heart malformations (Fontan operation). The beneficial effect was also found in majority of children suffering from congestive cardiomyopathy. Convertase inhibitor was always successfully used as the unique antihypertensive drug in children suffering from arterial hypertension. In the other cases treatment was combined (mainly with digitalis). This combination seems to be exceptionally useful in children suffering from congestive cardiomyopathy. Only in 1 case unserious side effect was found (persistent cough).

A common late effect of doxorubicin therapy for childhood cancer is reduced left-ventricular (LV) wall thickness resulting in elevated LV afterload and depressed LV function. Many children are given angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, which have been studied primarily in adults. We document the long-term effects of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors in doxorubicin-treated survivors of childhood cancer. In this retrospective study, we reviewed records of 18 children who had regular echocardiographic examinations during enalapril therapy (mean age at cancer diagnosis, 8 years; mean time between completion of doxorubicin therapy and start of enalapril, 7 years; median follow-up since the start of enalapril, 10 years). Over the first 6 years of enalapril therapy, there was progressive improvement toward normal values in LV dimension, afterload, fractional shortening, and mass, but all these parameters deteriorated between 6 and 10 years. LV wall thickness deteriorated throughout the study period, as did LV contractility and systolic blood pressure. Diastolic blood pressure fell slightly. By 6 years on enalapril, all six patients who had had congestive heart failure at the start of enalapril therapy had either died or undergone cardiac transplantation, compared with three of the 12 asymptomatic patients. In doxorubicin-treated long-term survivors of childhood cancer, enalapril-induced improvement in LV structure and function is transient. The primary defect, which is LV wall thinning, continues to deteriorate, and thus the short-term improvement was mostly related to lowered diastolic blood pressure.
