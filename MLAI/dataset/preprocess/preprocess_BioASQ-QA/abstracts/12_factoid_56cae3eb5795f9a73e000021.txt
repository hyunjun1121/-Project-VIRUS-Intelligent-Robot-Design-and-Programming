It is unclear whether recent therapeutic advances have improved the growth of children with Crohn's disease (CD). To assess the frequency of short stature and poor growth and their relationship to disease course and therapy in children with CD. WHAT IS ALREADY KNOWN ON THIS TOPIC: Growth retardation may occur in children with Crohn's disease (CD). Current therapy for CD in the UK is less likely than previously to involve the use of long-term glucocorticoids. Despite advances in therapy, short stature and slow growth continue to be encountered in children with CD. There is a need for simple and consistent definitions of growth that can identify poor growth in children with chronic disease. The anthropometric and treatment details of 116 children (68 male) with a mean (range) age at diagnosis of 10.8 years (4.9-15.5) and a mean age at maximum follow-up (MF) of 15.4 years (9.4-19.3) were studied retrospectively at diagnosis (T0), at 1 (T1), 2 (T2) and 3 years (T3) after diagnosis and at MF. At T0, mean height SD score (HtSDS) was -0.5 (-3.3 to 2.6) compared to a mid-parental HtSDS of 0.2 (-2.0 to 01.4) (p=0.002). At T1, T2, T3 and MF, mean HtSDS was -0.6 (-4.8 to 7.8), -0.6 (-2.9 to 2.2), -0.7 (-3.6 to 2.5) and -0.5 (-3.5 to 2.9), respectively. Mean Ht velocity (HV) SDS at T1, T2, T3 and MF was -1.4 (-7.4 to 7.4), -0.6 (-7.5 to 6.1), -0.1 (-6.6 to 7.6) and 0.6 (-4.8 to 7.8), respectively (p<0.05). In final models, HtSDS was associated negatively with the use of prednisolone (p=0.0001), azathioprine (p=0.0001), methotrexate (p=0.0001) and weight SDS (WtSDS) (p=0.0001). HVSDS was associated positively with age (p=0.0001) and WtSDS (p=0.01). ΔHtSDS was associated negatively with use of prednisolone (p<0.02). Although current therapy for CD is associated with improved rate of growth for the first few years, a substantial proportion of children remain short. This study also highlights the need for consistency in describing growth in children with chronic diseases.

Crohn's disease (CD) is often associated with antibodies to microbial antigens. Differences in immune response may offer clues to the pathogenesis of the disease. The aim was to examine the influence of age at diagnosis on the serologic response in children with CD. Data were drawn from 3 North American multicenter pediatric inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) research consortia. At or shortly after diagnosis, pANCA, ASCA IgA, ASCA IgG, anti-ompC, and anti-CBir1 were assayed. The results were compared as a function of age at CD diagnosis (0-7 years versus 8-15 years). In all, 705 children (79 <8 years of age at diagnosis, 626 >or=8 years) were studied. Small bowel CD was less frequent in the younger group (48.7% versus 72.6%; P < 0.0001), while colonic involvement was comparable (91.0% versus 86.5%). ASCA IgA and IgG were seen in <20% of those 0-7 years old compared to nearly 40% of those 8-15 years old (P < 0.001), while anti-CBir1 was more frequent in the younger children (66% versus 54%, P < 0.05). Anti-CBir1 detected a significant number of children in both age groups who otherwise were serologically negative. Both age at diagnosis and site of CD involvement were independently associated with expression of ASCA and anti-CBir1. Compared to children 8-15 years of age at diagnosis, those 0-7 years are more likely to express anti-CBir1 but only half as likely to express ASCA. These age-associated differences in antimicrobial seropositivity suggest that there may be different, and as yet unrecognized, genetic, immunologic, and/or microbial factors leading to CD in the youngest children.

The aim of the study was to examine the influence of age at diagnosis of Crohn's disease on disease site and course in Tunisian patients. All hospital patients for Crohn's disease between 1993 and 2002 were included. They were segregated by age at diagnosis as follows: younger than 20 years, 20-39 years, and 40 years or older. And all patients were classified at the time of the latest visit into one of three subtypes of disease (non complicating, stricturing, and fistulizing) according Vienna's classification. Crohn's disease was devised also by site (ileum, ileocecal, colon and higher site). Sixty one patients (50.4%) were 20-39 years old and 43 patients (35.5%) were 40 years and older. Colonic involvement was significantly more common (46,5%) in the 40 years and older group compared with 20-39 years group (24.6%) (p = 0.01). The subtype without complication was significantly more common (58.1%) in the 40 years and older group compared with 20-39 years group (39.3%) (p = 0.05). The frequency of the need for surgery for any indication for Crohn's disease didn't differ significantly according to age. In this study, Crohn's disease diagnosed in tunisian patients that were 40 years and older had often a colonic site and a less severe phenotype supporting the concept of genetic heterogeneity.

Crohn's disease (CD) diagnosed in pediatric patients has been reported to have a more aggressive phenotype and course, with a greater prevalence of upper gastrointestinal involvement, than in adults. However, studies have not accounted for differences in diagnostic tests. We aimed to discern whether, in fact, CD diagnosed in childhood has a different outcome than CD diagnosed in adults. We performed comprehensive medical chart reviews of 571 patients with CD (451 with complete data) who were followed in a single referral inflammatory bowel disease clinic in Winnipeg, Canada, from 1993-2012. For specific time intervals, we determined types and numbers of imaging studies performed and parameters of disease phenotype, including age at diagnosis according to the Montreal classification (A1 diagnosed <17 years of age, A2 diagnosed 17-40 years, and A3 diagnosed >40 years). Within 1 year of diagnosis, a higher proportion of A1 patients had upper gastrointestinal involvement and ileocolonic (L3) disease than A2 or A3 patients. These differences could be partly accounted for by the diagnostic tests performed during this time period. Although A1 patients underwent more extensive imaging studies, they had a lower prevalence of complicated disease, particularly compared with A3 patients. After a median follow-up period of 11.1 years, complicated disease behavior (B2 [structuring] or B3 [penetrating]) was similar among the 3 groups. Nonetheless, at the end of the study period, rates of inflammatory bowel disease-related abdominal surgery were significantly lower for A1 than A2 patients (odds ratio, 0.63; 95% confidence interval, 0.41-0.98) but not for A3 patients (odds ratio, 0.71; 95% confidence interval, 0.40-1.27). On the basis of a database analysis of different age groups of patients with CD, studies of disease phenotypes among different cohorts should account for different patterns of diagnostic imaging evaluation. Our data show that although children are at increased risk of panenteric disease, they are not more likely to have more complicated disease or undergo surgery than adults.

We analyzed the characteristics associated with increased risk of osteoporosis in patients with Crohn's disease in Malta. Eighty-three patients with histologically and endoscopically confirmed Crohn's disease underwent a DEXA bone density scan and their phenotypic characteristics were analyzed. There was a significant association between body mass index and bone mineral density (P = 0.004) and a significant difference in the T scores of patients according to age at diagnosis (Montreal Classification: P = 0.0006) with patients diagnosed <17 years (n = 13) having lower T scores than those diagnosed at older age groups (n = 70). There was a significant difference between the T scores of patients on infliximab (n = 33) and those not on biological therapy (n = 50, P = 0.0058). Patients with high cumulative corticosteroid doses (>10 mg/d for >3 mo, n = 18) had lower bone mineral densities than patients who received smaller corticosteroid doses (P = 0.013). There was however no significant difference in the T scores of patients according to disease location (P = 0.18), disease type (P = 0.64), gender (P = 0.30), and history of ileal resection (P = 0.68). There was also no significant correlation between disease duration and T scores (hip) (P = 0.61). Low body mass index, early disease onset, high corticosteroid doses and, anti-tumor necrosis factor α therapy are associated with increased risk of osteoporosis. Lower T scores in patients on infliximab occur as patients receiving this therapy have more severe inflammation, which is associated with elevated osteoclastogenic factors, rather than as a side-effect of the anti-tumor necrosis factor-α therapy.

Recently researchers have suggested that clinical subsets of Crohn's disease occur, which are variously described as inflammatory, fibrostenotic, and fistulizing. In addition, it has been observed that within families with multiple cases, often there is concordance of the site and type of disease. The lesions of Crohn's disease occur in segments that suggest that distribution of Peyer's patches. When the age-related incidence of Crohn's disease was plotted for all countries from which such data were available, the peaks of greatest case frequency occurred at ages 15 to 25 years and paralleled a similar peak representing the number of Peyer's patches as a function of age. This correlation suggests that Crohn's disease may develop as an inflammatory process specifically targeting these important lymphoid structures. Similar peaks of activity in the adolescent to early adult years occur for appendicitis and tonsillitis.

Crohn's disease has a bimodal age distribution of disease onset diagnosis. The peaks (20 and 50 years) may represent different phenotypes or different genetic and/or environmental influences between younger- and older-onset individuals. The aim of this study was to examine the influences of age at diagnosis of Crohn's disease on disease site, type, and course. Records of 552 consecutive patients with Crohn's disease were reviewed retrospectively. Younger age at diagnosis (younger than 20 years), compared with an older age (40 years or older), was associated with a greater prevalence of a family history of Crohn's disease (29.9% vs. 13.6%), greater small bowel involvement (88.7% vs. 57.5%), more stricturing disease (45.8% vs. 28.8%), and a higher frequency of surgery (70.6% vs. 55.3%). Older age at diagnosis was associated with a greater prevalence of colonic disease (84.8% vs. 71.2%) and the inflammatory subtype (54.5% vs. 34.4%). A conditional logistic regression analysis confirmed an independent effect of age at diagnosis on ileal disease and surgery for intractable disease. In Crohn's disease, early age at diagnosis is associated with more complicated disease and a greater likelihood of having affected relatives. Stratification of Crohn's disease by age at diagnosis provides support for the concept of genetic heterogeneity.

Our objectives were to assess the differences in perforating disease behavior, disease severity, and extraintestinal manifestations (EIM) in patients with Crohn's disease (CD) by race. We identified outpatients with CD evaluated at the University of Maryland Gastroenterology Faculty Practice office or the Baltimore Veterans Affairs Maryland Health Care System, from 1997 to 2005. We assessed age at diagnosis, disease behavior, disease location, need for surgery and EIM. Race was not associated with perforating disease behavior (relative risk [RR] 0.79, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.46-1.35), need for surgery (RR 0.89, 95% CI 0.56-1.12), and EIM of CD (RR 0.77, 95% CI 0.46-1.27). White patients were significantly more likely to have ileal disease, whereas African American patients were significantly more likely to have ileocolonic and colonic disease. Age at diagnosis younger than 40 years (odds ratio [OR] 4.41, 95% CI 1.84-10.56) and ileocolonic disease (OR 2.39, 95% CI 1.24-4.63) were independent risk factors for perforating disease behavior. Similarly, age at diagnosis younger than 40 (OR 2.79, 95% CI 1.45-5.33), ileal disease (OR 3.76, 95% CI 1.66-8.48), and ileocolonic disease (OR 2.57, 95% CI1.21-5.46) were associated with the need for surgery. Female gender (OR 4.23, 95% CI 1.87-9.58) and a positive family history of CD (OR 3.45, 95% CI 1.49-8.0) were associated with joint manifestations of CD. We did not detect differences in disease behavior, severity, or joint EIM by race. Although African American patients were more likely to have ileocolonic or colonic disease, these factors did not affect disease behavior or severity.

fifteen percent of patients with Crohn's disease (CD) are elderly; they are less likely to have complications and more likely to have colonic disease. to compare disease behaviour in patients with CD based on age at diagnosis. cross-sectional study. tertiary referral centre. patients with confirmed CD. behaviour was characterised according to the Montreal classification. Patients with either stricturing or penetrating disease were classified as having complicated disease. Age at diagnosis was categorised as <17, 17-40, 41-59 and ≥ 60 years. Logistic regression analysis was performed to examine the association between advanced age ≥ 60 and complicated disease. a total of 467 patients were evaluated between 2004 and 2010. Increasing age of diagnosis was negatively associated with complicated disease and positively associated with colonic disease. As age of diagnosis increased, disease duration (P < 0.001), family history of Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) (P = 0.015) and perianal disease decreased (P < 0.0015). After adjustment for confounding variables, the association between age at diagnosis and complicated disease was no longer significant (OR: 0.60, 95% CI: 0.21-1.65). patients diagnosed with CD ≥ 60 were more likely to have colonic disease and non-complicated disease. However, the association between age at diagnosis and complicated disease did not persist after adjustment for confounding variables.

For patients with Crohn's disease, age at onset is known to influence the clinical course of the illness. The aim of this study is to seek an association between age at onset of Crohn's disease and use of biologic agents for its treatment. We reviewed the medical records of 127 veteran patients with Crohn's disease treated at our hospital, and compared differences in age at disease onset between patients who had received biologics and those who had not. The mean age of our patients was 54.9 ± 15.4 years, and 34% were currently receiving or had previously received treatment with a biologic agent. For those with biologic use, average age at time of diagnosis of Crohn's disease was 32.3 ± 12.2 years, compared with 43.7 ± 16.3 years for those who had not received biologics (P = 0.005). This relationship remained significant even after controlling for disease severity. The frequency of use of biologic agents varied inversely with age at diagnosis. For patients diagnosed before age 21 years, 55.5% had used biologics, whereas no patient >70 years of age at time of diagnosis had used biologics. We found no significant correlation between biologic use and duration of disease, smoking or ethnicity. Perianal disease and concomitant arthritis were both significantly associated with use of biologics. In our veteran patients with Crohn's disease, frequency of treatment with a biologic agent varied inversely with age at disease onset.

Fifteen percent of incident Crohn's disease (CD) cases are diagnosed at older ages and demonstrate colonic location and inflammatory behavior. Serologic responses to gut microbial antigens are associated with specific phenotypes, and may differ by age at diagnosis. Our aim was to identify an association between age at diagnosis of CD and responses to gut microbial antigens. Levels of anti-Saccharomyces cerevisiae antibodies (ASCA) immunoglobulins A and G (IgA and IgG), antibodies to Escherichia coli outer membrane porin-C (anti-Omp-C), antibodies to clostridial flagellin (anti-CBir-1), and perinuclear anti-neutrophil cytoplasmic antibodies (p-ANCA) were compared in patients by age in three diagnosis groups: patients diagnosed at ages of <40, ≥40-59, and ≥60 years. For each antigen, patients with antibody levels in the first, second, third, and fourth quartile were assigned a score of 1, 2, 3, or 4, respectively. Individual scores were added to create a quartile sum score representing cumulative quantitative immune response. Eighteen, 17, and 12 patients were diagnosed at ages <40, 40-59, and ≥60 years, respectively. The majority (71%) had ileocolonic disease in the youngest group, compared to 36% in the oldest group (P=0.001). Mean ASCA IgA and IgG titers were increased in the youngest age group compared to the older groups (P=0.19 and P=0.13, respectively). Mean quartile sum scores for antibody levels were 7.2±2.8 in those patients diagnosed at ages <40 years, 4.9±2.9 in the 40-59-year-old age group, and 5.6±2.6 in the ≥60-year-old age group (P=0.06). A trend toward decreased cumulative immune responses to CD-associated gut antigens was observed in CD patients diagnosed at older ages compared to younger patients. Host responses to microbial antigens may be less important in older onset IBD and may contribute to the distinct phenotype in this group.

Crohn's disease incidence rates have stabilised in industrialised countries since the 1980s. Conversely, a continuing increase in childhood-onset Crohn's disease incidence has been reported. To confirm trends in inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) incidence in northern France over an extended time period (1988-2007) with a focus on childhood-onset Crohn's disease. The IBD patients recorded in the EPIMAD registry between 1988 and 2007 were included. Standardised incidence rates were calculated for Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis in the entire population, and separately according to age. Evolution of phenotypes at diagnosis was also studied. A total of 12 084 incident IBD cases (7428 Crohn's disease and 4656 ulcerative colitis) were recorded. Crohn's disease incidence rates increased from 5.2 cases/100 000 persons in 1988-1990 to 6.7 in 2006-2007 (+29%), stabilising after a peak at 7.1 in 1997-1999. Crohn's disease incidence rates in the 10-19-year age category increased by 71%, from 6.5 (1988-1990) to 11.1 (2006-2007). The frequency of initial ileo-colonic localisation increased from 52.9% in 1988-1990 to 68.6% in 2006-2007 (P<0.0001). Ulcerative colitis incidence rates decreased during the same period. From 1988 to 2007, Crohn's disease incidence increased by 29% in northern France and by 71% in the 10-19-year-old age group. Consequently, studies on Crohn's disease risk factors should focus on the population under 20 years of age.
