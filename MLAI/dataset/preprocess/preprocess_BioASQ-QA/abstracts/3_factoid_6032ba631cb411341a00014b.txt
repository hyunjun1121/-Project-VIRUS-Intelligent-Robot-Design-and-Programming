Lysozymes are an ancient group of antimicrobial enzymes of the innate immune system. Here we provide a comparative analysis of the evolution and function of lysozymes during early development in fish, the most speciose vertebrate group. In fishes, lineage and species-specific evolution of both C-type (chicken or conventional) and G-type (goose type) genes occurred. Phylogenetic analysis revealed that the teleost lysozyme G-type members group with the tetrapod homologues but the teleost C-type form three different clusters with the tetrapods. Most of the teleost C-type cluster with tetrapod Lyz but there are some that group with the mammalian Lyzl1/2 and LALBA. This suggests that early in gnathostome evolution these genes already existed and that lyzl1/2 and lalba genes are present in fish and tetrapods. Gene synteny analysis to confirm sequence orthologies failed to identify conserved genome regions between teleosts and other vertebrates lysozyme gene regions suggesting that in the ancestral bony fish genome lyz, lyzl1/2, lalba and lyg precursor genes were transposed to different chromosome regions. The homologue of the mammalian lactalbumin (LALBA) gene was identified for the first time in teleosts and was expressed in skin and during egg and larval development. Lysozyme activity was detected in teleost eggs and varied between species and in the gilthead sea bream lyg and lalba transcript abundance differed in eggs and larvae from different brood stock suggesting differences exist in maternal innate immune protection.

The ICChI is a 35-kDa, glycosylated protein isolated from the latex of the weed Ipomoea carnea. It displays chitinase and lysozyme activity, which could be important for the defense against pathogenic fungi, insects and bacteria. The ICChI enzyme was crystallized, and a diffraction data set was collected from a single crystal to 1.42 Å resolution. The crystals belong to the primitive tetragonal space group P4<sub>3</sub>2<sub>1</sub>2, with unit-cell parameters a = b = 57.9, c = 172.0 Å, and α = β = γ = 90°. The structure was elucidated by molecular replacement method using a mixed model of three homologous structures from the N-terminal sequence of ICChI. The refined model consists of 272 amino acid residues and has a R<sub>factor</sub> of 18.93% and R<sub>free</sub> of 22.42%. The protein consists of a single globular domain with a (α/β)<sub>8</sub> triosephosphate isomerase barrel fold. Three of the consensus sites for N-glycosylation viz., Asn<sup>45</sup>, Asn<sup>172</sup>, and Asn<sup>194</sup> containing carbohydrate moieties N-Acetylglucosamine (NAG), mannose, fucose, and xylose. The putative catalytic residues are Asp<sup>125</sup>, Glu<sup>127</sup>, and Tyr<sup>184</sup>. The crystal structure may provide fundamental information of GH18 family chitinases.

The jejunum is the segment of the small intestine responsible for several metabolism and biotransformation functions. In this report, we have cultured rat jejunum explants <i>in vitro</i> and integrated them with hepatocyte cultures. We have also investigated the changes in jejunum function at different locations since spatial variations in intestinal functions have been reported previously. We divided the length of the rat jejunum into three distinct regions of approximately 9 cm each. We defined the regions as proximal (adjacent to the duodenum), medial, and distal (adjacent to the ileum). Spatiotemporal variations in functions were observed between these regions within the jejunum. Alkaline phosphatase activity (a marker of enterocyte function), decreased twofold between the proximal and distal regions at 4 hr. Lysozyme activity (a marker of Paneth cell function) increased from the proximal to the distal jejunum by 40% at 24 hr. Mucin-covered areas, a marker of goblet cell function, increased by twofold between the proximal and distal segments of the jejunum at 24 hr. When hepatocytes were integrated with proximal jejunum explants, statistically higher urea (~2.4-fold) and mucin (57%) production were observed in the jejunum explants. The integrated intestine-liver cultures can be used as a platform for future investigations.
