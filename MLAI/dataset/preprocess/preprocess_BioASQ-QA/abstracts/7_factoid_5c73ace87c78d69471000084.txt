Hypomethylating agents (HMAs) are the standard of care for patients with myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS). Although these agents induce responses in up to 40% of patients, most patients ultimately experience loss of response. The purpose of this review is to provide an overview of the different therapies under development for MDS after HMA therapy. Recent advances in the understanding of MDS pathogenesis have led to the development of new potential therapies after HMA failure. Newer HMAs, less susceptible to in-vivo deamination, such as guadecitabine or ASTX727 have shown activity. Alterations of immune checkpoints in MDS have led to multiple clinical trials evaluating the activity of monoclonal antibodies targeting these proteins (pembrolizumab, nivolumab, ipilimumab). Different combinations and new formulations of cytotoxic agents, such as clofarabine or CPX-351, are newer options for specific subsets of patients. Finally, targeted agents inhibiting multiple kinases (rigosertib), BCL2 (venetoclax) or mutant IDH1 (ivosidenib), IDH2 (enasidenib), FLT3 (sorafenib, midostaurin) or spliceosome components (H3B-8800) are other novel options. Despite the poor prognosis associated with HMA failure, clinical trials, new cytotoxic agents and allogeneic stem-cell transplantation, can offer therapeutic opportunities for these patients for whom there is no standard of care.

Somatic mutations in the isocitrate dehydrogenase 2 gene (IDH2) contribute to the pathogenesis of acute myeloid leukaemia (AML) through the production of the oncometabolite 2-hydroxyglutarate (2HG)<sup>1-8</sup>. Enasidenib (AG-221) is an allosteric inhibitor that binds to the IDH2 dimer interface and blocks the production of 2HG by IDH2 mutants<sup>9,10</sup>. In a phase I/II clinical trial, enasidenib inhibited the production of 2HG and induced clinical responses in relapsed or refractory IDH2-mutant AML<sup>11</sup>. Here we describe two patients with IDH2-mutant AML who had a clinical response to enasidenib followed by clinical resistance, disease progression, and a recurrent increase in circulating levels of 2HG. We show that therapeutic resistance is associated with the emergence of second-site IDH2 mutations in trans, such that the resistance mutations occurred in the IDH2 allele without the neomorphic R140Q mutation. The in trans mutations occurred at glutamine 316 (Q316E) and isoleucine 319 (I319M), which are at the interface where enasidenib binds to the IDH2 dimer. The expression of either of these mutant disease alleles alone did not induce the production of 2HG; however, the expression of the Q316E or I319M mutation together with the R140Q mutation in trans allowed 2HG production that was resistant to inhibition by enasidenib. Biochemical studies predicted that resistance to allosteric IDH inhibitors could also occur via IDH dimer-interface mutations in cis, which was confirmed in a patient with acquired resistance to the IDH1 inhibitor ivosidenib (AG-120). Our observations uncover a mechanism of acquired resistance to a targeted therapy and underscore the importance of 2HG production in the pathogenesis of IDH-mutant malignancies.

Somatic point mutations at a key arginine residue (R132) within the active site of the metabolic enzyme isocitrate dehydrogenase 1 (IDH1) confer a novel gain of function in cancer cells, resulting in the production of d-2-hydroxyglutarate (2-HG), an oncometabolite. Elevated 2-HG levels are implicated in epigenetic alterations and impaired cellular differentiation. IDH1 mutations have been described in an array of hematologic malignancies and solid tumors. Here, we report the discovery of AG-120 (ivosidenib), an inhibitor of the IDH1 mutant enzyme that exhibits profound 2-HG lowering in tumor models and the ability to effect differentiation of primary patient AML samples ex vivo. Preliminary data from phase 1 clinical trials enrolling patients with cancers harboring an IDH1 mutation indicate that AG-120 has an acceptable safety profile and clinical activity.

Mutations in the gene encoding isocitrate dehydrogenase 1 ( IDH1) occur in 6 to 10% of patients with acute myeloid leukemia (AML). Ivosidenib (AG-120) is an oral, targeted, small-molecule inhibitor of mutant IDH1. We conducted a phase 1 dose-escalation and dose-expansion study of ivosidenib monotherapy in IDH1-mutated AML. Safety and efficacy were assessed in all treated patients. The primary efficacy population included patients with relapsed or refractory AML receiving 500 mg of ivosidenib daily with at least 6 months of follow-up. Overall, 258 patients received ivosidenib and had safety outcomes assessed. Among patients with relapsed or refractory AML (179 patients), treatment-related adverse events of grade 3 or higher that occurred in at least 3 patients were prolongation of the QT interval (in 7.8% of the patients), the IDH differentiation syndrome (in 3.9%), anemia (in 2.2%), thrombocytopenia or a decrease in the platelet count (in 3.4%), and leukocytosis (in 1.7%). In the primary efficacy population (125 patients), the rate of complete remission or complete remission with partial hematologic recovery was 30.4% (95% confidence interval [CI], 22.5 to 39.3), the rate of complete remission was 21.6% (95% CI, 14.7 to 29.8), and the overall response rate was 41.6% (95% CI, 32.9 to 50.8). The median durations of these responses were 8.2 months (95% CI, 5.5 to 12.0), 9.3 months (95% CI, 5.6 to 18.3), and 6.5 months (95% CI, 4.6 to 9.3), respectively. Transfusion independence was attained in 29 of 84 patients (35%), and patients who had a response had fewer infections and febrile neutropenia episodes than those who did not have a response. Among 34 patients who had a complete remission or complete remission with partial hematologic recovery, 7 (21%) had no residual detectable IDH1 mutations on digital polymerase-chain-reaction assay. No preexisting co-occurring single gene mutation predicted clinical response or resistance to treatment. In patients with advanced IDH1-mutated relapsed or refractory AML, ivosidenib at a dose of 500 mg daily was associated with a low frequency of grade 3 or higher treatment-related adverse events and with transfusion independence, durable remissions, and molecular remissions in some patients with complete remission.

Ivosidenib (Tibsovo<sup>®</sup>) is a small molecule, orally available inhibitor of mutated cytosolic isocitrate dehydrogenase 1 (IDH1) that is being developed by Agios Pharmaceuticals for the treatment of cancer in patients with IDH1 mutations. The mutated form of the IDH1 enzyme produces a metabolite, 2-hydroxyglutarate (2-HG), which is thought to play a role in the formation and progression of acute myeloid leukaemia (AML), gliomas and other cancers. Elevated 2-HG levels interfere with cellular metabolism and epigenetic regulation, thereby contributing to oncogenesis. Ivosidenib targets the IDH1 metabolic pathway to prevent a build-up of the oncometabolite 2-HG. This article summarizes the milestones in the development of ivosidenib leading to this first approval in the USA for the treatment of patients with relapsed or refractory AML with a susceptible IDH1 mutation. Clinical development for AML, cholangiocarcinoma, glioma, myelodysplastic syndromes and solid tumours is ongoing worldwide.

The FDA approved ivosidenib for patients with <i>IDH1</i>-mutant relapsed/refractory acute myeloid leukemia. The approval was based on results of a phase I trial in which 32.8% of patients treated with the drug had a complete remission or a complete remission with a partial hematologic recovery.

A phase I study suggests that ivosidenib can induce remission in patients with relapsed or refractory acute myeloid leukemia characterized by <i>IDH1</i> mutations. The drug spurred complete remission or complete remission with partial hematologic recovery in 30.4% of patients. The most common side effects of at least grade 3 were prolonged QT interval and IDH differentiation syndrome.
