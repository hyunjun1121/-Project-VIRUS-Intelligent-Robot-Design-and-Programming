Bluetongue virus (BTV) genome contains ten double-stranded RNA segments. The sequence of the plus strand of each of the BTV genomic double-stranded RNAs is the same as that of its mRNA, which encodes for a single viral protein, except the smallest S4 segment which can encode for two nonstructural proteins, primarily for the release assistance of the viral progeny. The separation and isolation of each BTV dsRNA segment and viral protein have provided extensive data related to its viral infection, pathology, suppression of host cellular functions, and eventual apoptosis of the infected host cells. This cytoplasmic virus is also an animal killer that costs the U.S. livestock industry at least $125 million yearly. However, this virus has no known effect on humans. Thus, it is very safe to carry out investigation with the virus, preferably in a BSL-2 laboratory.
