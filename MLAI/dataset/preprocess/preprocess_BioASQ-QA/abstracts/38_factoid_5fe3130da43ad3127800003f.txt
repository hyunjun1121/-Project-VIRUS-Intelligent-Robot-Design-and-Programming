. The 28-joint DAS (DAS28), clinical disease activity index (CDAI) and simplified disease activity index (SDAI) are indices frequently used to assess disease activity in RA patients. Cut-off values were defined to classify the states of RA disease activity: remission, low, moderate and high. The aim of this work was to assess disease activity states classified by DAS28, CDAI and SDAI and to analyse their agreement in the Rheumatic Diseases Portuguese Register Reuma.pt. . A total of 2795 patients and 14 440 visits were selected from Reuma.pt for analysis. Pearson's correlation coefficients (PCCs) were calculated for the three indices. McNemar's chi-squared tests, PCCs and kappa statistics were performed to analyse and compare the distribution of visits among all disease activity states and indices. A strong correlation was found between the three indices throughout the 14 440 visits: r = 0.874 for DAS28/CDAI, r = 0.877 for DAS28/SDAI and r = 0.984 for CDAI/SDAI (all PCCs with P < 0.0001). However, when categorization in the different disease activity states was analysed, McNemar's chi-squared tests and PCCs revealed significant disagreement between the cut-offs of the three indices. DAS28, CDAI and SDAI cut-offs do not translate into the same clinical information in Reuma.pt. Although this might be expected for the original DAS28 cut-offs, when compared with CDAI and SDAI significant disagreement was also found for the DAS28 modified cut-offs. For visits where patients are in CDAI or SDAI remission, we also find disagreement between these two indices, which may contradict previous conclusions that acute phase reactants add little to composite disease activity indices for RA.

The Disease Activity Score in 28 joints (DAS28) is a key measure in clinical practice and clinical trials. There are at least five different versions of the 'Patient Global' Visual Analogue Scale (PG-VAS) being used in the DAS28. The developers suggested that the PG-VAS can be an assessment of global health or disease activity, but did not specify the wording of the question. There is no consensus on what the PG-VAS is intended to capture, and the different words and phrases have not been evaluated. The aim of this study was to test if phrasing affects PG-VAS scores and hence yields different results for the DAS28. Fifty patients with rheumatoid arthritis taking biologic agents in a rheumatology outpatient department completed a self-administered questionnaire containing five versions of the 100 mm PG-VAS. All PG-VAS versions correlated strongly with each other (rho = 0.67-0.87, p < 0.0001). However, individual scores for each PG-VAS, when compared with the comparator on a Bland-Altman chart had wide limits of agreement--the largest being -42 mm to +45 mm. The five overall DAS28 scores were calculated for each patient using the five different PG-VAS. The largest difference in DAS28 scores was 0.63. Different phrasing of the PG-VAS gives different DAS28 results. As the DAS28 is a key outcome measure, such differences have the potential to influence clinical decisions relating to eligibility for biologic agents and evaluation of new therapies. We urgently need to decide on the concept to be measured and the phrasing required to capture this. The PG-VAS phrasing should then be standardized and validated.

We used the 28-joint Disease Activity Score (DAS28) and the European League Against Rheumatism Sjögren's Syndrome Disease Activity Index (ESSDAI) articular domain to assess the effect of rituximab (RTX) and abatacept (ABA) on articular involvement in primary Sjögren syndrome (pSS). Patients with pSS treated with RTX (n = 18) or ABA (n = 13) and having a DAS28 erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR)/C-reactive protein (CRP) level ≥ 3.2 at baseline were selected. Generalized estimating equations were used to analyze the DAS28 and ESSDAI articular domain over time. In the RTX group, DAS28-ESR/CRP decreased significantly up to 48 weeks. In the ABA group, DAS28-ESR/CRP decreased significantly up to 24 weeks. DAS28 correlated significantly with ESSDAI articular domain. DAS28 is useful to evaluate the effect of biologicals on articular involvement in patients with pSS.

This prospective one-year follow-up study was conducted from 835 visits in 178 rheumatoid arthritis (RA) patients. Tender-/swollen-joint count, Health Assessment Questionnaire Disability Index (HAQ-DI), Disease Activity Score 28-ESR (DAS28-ESR), DAS28-CRP, Simplified Disease Activity Index (SDAI) and DAS28-monocyte chemotactic protein-1 (DAS28-MCP-1) scores were obtained every 3 months. Radiographs of hands and feet were acquired at baseline and one year. We evaluated the correlation and accuracy of activity scores in predicting remission, HAQ-DI changes and radiographic changes. DAS28-MCP-1 correlated strongly with DAS28-ESR, DAS28-CRP and SDAI scores (0.830, 0.899 and 0.931, respectively, with all P < 0.001). Score changes of DAS28-MCP-1 were comparable to those of DAS28-ESR, DAS28-CRP and SDAI in predicting changes in HAQ-DI and bone erosion. DAS28-MCP-1 (<2.2) was better than DAS28-ESR (<2.6) in indicating modified American Rheumatism Association remission and 2011 American College of Rheumatology/European League Against Rheumatism remission (75.61% vs. 36.99% and 81.71% vs. 49.13%, respectively) with odds ratios of 5.28 and 4.62 (both P < 0.001), respectively. We compared DAS28-MCP-1 with SDAI (≦3.3) in indicating remission with odds ratios of 2.63 (P = 0.002) and 0.98, respectively (and DAS28-MCP-1 with DAS28-CRP < 2.5: 1.33 and 0.92). Therefore, DAS28-MCP-1 is useful as an alternative in assessing RA activity.

Pain remains the most important problem for people with rheumatoid arthritis (RA). Active inflammatory disease contributes to pain, but pain due to non-inflammatory mechanisms can confound the assessment of disease activity. We hypothesize that augmented pain processing, fibromyalgic features, poorer mental health, and patient-reported 28-joint disease activity score (DAS28) components are associated in RA. In total, 50 people with stable, long-standing RA recruited from a rheumatology outpatient clinic were assessed for pain-pressure thresholds (PPTs) at three separate sites (knee, tibia, and sternum), DAS28, fibromyalgia, and mental health status. Multivariable analysis was performed to assess the association between PPT and DAS28 components, DAS28-P (the proportion of DAS28 derived from the patient-reported components of visual analogue score and tender joint count), or fibromyalgia status. More-sensitive PPTs at sites over or distant from joints were each associated with greater reported pain, higher patient-reported DAS28 components, and poorer mental health. A high proportion of participants (48%) satisfied classification criteria for fibromyalgia, and fibromyalgia classification or characteristics were each associated with more sensitive PPTs, higher patient-reported DAS28 components, and poorer mental health. Widespread sensitivity to pressure-induced pain, a high prevalence of fibromyalgic features, higher patient-reported DAS28 components, and poorer mental health are all linked in established RA. The increased sensitivity at nonjoint sites (sternum and anterior tibia), as well as over joints, indicates that central mechanisms may contribute to pain sensitivity in RA. The contribution of patient-reported components to high DAS28 should inform decisions on disease-modifying or pain-management approaches in the treatment of RA when inflammation may be well controlled.

Non-adherence to disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs (DMARDs) hampers the targets of rheumatoid arthritis (RA) treatment, obtaining low disease activity and decreasing radiological progression. This study investigates if, and to what extent, non-adherence to treatment would lead to a higher 28-joint count disease activity score (DAS28) in the first year after diagnosis. Adult patients from an ongoing cohort study on treatment adherence were selected if they fulfilled the EULAR/ACR2010 criteria for RA, and were to start with their first DMARDs. Clinical variables were assessed at baseline and every 3 months. Non-adherence was continuously electronically measured and was defined as the proportion of days with a negative difference between expected and observed openings of the medication container out of the 3-month period before DAS28 measurement. Generalized linear mixed models were used to investigate whether the DAS28 related to non-adherence. Covariates included were age, sex, baseline DAS28, rheumatoid factor positivity, anti-cyclic citrullinated peptide antibodies (ACPA) positivity, anxiety, depression, weeks of treatment, number of DMARDs used, education level, use of subcutaneous methotrexate and biological use. One hundred and twenty patients met the inclusion criteria for RA. During the study period 17 patients became lost to follow-up. There was a decline in adherence over time for all DMARDs except for prednisone. Non-adherence is a predictor of disease activity in the first 6 months of therapy, adjusted for weeks of treatment, baseline DAS28, and baseline anxiety. Non-adherence relates to disease activity. Therefore, interventions towards enhancing adherence can improve disease outcome.

Antirheumatic treatment is frequently not appropriately modified, according to American College of Rheumatology guidelines, in patients with active rheumatoid arthritis (RA) as defined by a Disease Activity Score in 28 joints (DAS28) score greater than 3.2. The objective of this study was to determine which factors most strongly influence patients' and rheumatologists' decisions to escalate care. We administered a Maximum Difference Scaling survey to 106 rheumatologists and 213 patients with RA. The survey included 58 factors related to the decision to escalate care in RA. Participants answered 24 choice tasks. In each task, participants were asked to choose the most important factor from a set of 5. We used hierarchical Bayes modeling to generate the mean relative importance score (RIS) for each factor. For rheumatologists, the 5 most influential factors were number of swollen joints (mean ± SD RIS 5.2 ± 0.4), DAS28 score (mean ± SD RIS 5.2 ± 0.5), physician global assessment of disease activity (mean ± SD RIS 5.2 ± 0.6), worsening erosions over the last year (mean ± SD RIS 5.2 ± 0.5), and RA disease activity now compared to 3 months ago (mean ± SD RIS 5.1 ± 0.6). For patients, the 5 most important factors were current level of physical functioning (mean ± SD RIS 4.3 ± 1.1), motivation to get better (mean ± SD RIS 3.5 ± 1.4), trust in their rheumatologist (mean ± SD RIS 3.5 ± 1.6), satisfaction with current disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs (mean ± SD RIS 3.4 ± 1.4), and current number of painful joints (mean ± SD RIS 3.4 ± 1.4). Factors influencing the decision to escalate care differ between rheumatologists and patients. Better communication between patients and their physicians may improve treatment planning in RA patients with active disease.

To assess the factorial structure of the Disease Activity Score including a 28-joint count (DAS28) if applied in patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA) and psoriatic arthritis (PsA). DAS28 values from 85 consecutive PsA outpatients and 2 RA patient cohorts comprising 85 patients each were compared. The first RA cohort (RA1) consisted of age- and sex-matched patients seen during the same period as the patients with PsA. The first 85 RA outpatients from September 2003 were included in the second cohort (RA2). Item weighting, factor loading, and internal consistency were assessed by factor analysis, principal component analysis, and calculation of Cronbach's alpha. The mean +/- SD DAS28 scores of patients in the PsA, RA1, and RA2 cohorts were 3.2 +/- 1.31, 3.21 +/- 1.45, and 3.79 +/- 1.44, respectively. A significant difference between the PsA and RA2 cohorts was found for DAS28 (P = 0.0063), swollen joint count (P = 0.007), and patient's global assessment (P < 0.001), but not for erythrocyte sedimentation rate. Internal consistency of the DAS28 in patients with PsA was considerably lower, item weighting showed remarkable differences, and factor analysis revealed that the DAS28 constitutes a bidimensional instrument in patients with PsA, whereas in both RA cohorts it appeared to be monodimensional. With respect to its statistical properties, the DAS28 proved to be considerably different in PsA compared with RA. Therefore its application for disease activity assessment in patients with PsA cannot be recommended without a formal validation procedure.

The Disease Activity Score including 28 joints (DAS28) and the Clinical Disease Activity Index (CDAI) were developed in order to provide a quantifiable measure of rheumatoid arthritis (RA) activity. The aim of this study was to evaluate the validity and internal consistency reliability for DAS28 and CDAI in patients with RA seen by rheumatologists in usual clinical care. We also compared proposed categories of high, moderate, and low activity and remission according to both scores. A sample of 2864 RA patients (2267 female, 597 male; mean age 58.5 yr, range 18-88 yr) were enrolled in this cross-sectional community-based study. Disease activity was assessed in each patient based on DAS28 and CDAI. Patients completed the Health Assessment Questionnaire (HAQ). Statistical evaluation was carried out by applying the Cronbach's values and principal component analysis (internal consistency reliability), the Pearson's coefficients, ANOVA and kappa statistic (convergent validity) and receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis (discriminant validity). Internal consistency testing of both scores indicated a reasonable difference, with Cronbach's alpha slightly higher for the DAS28. Interestingly, factor analysis revealed that the DAS28 constitutes a monocomponent measure in RA. Linear regression analysis showed a significant correlation between DAS28 and CDAI (p<0.0001). In addition, the DAS28 and CDAI were well correlated with HAQ (both at p level of <0.0001). The discriminatory power of both indices was good, without significant difference, but our results showed wide differences in both moderate/high disease activity and remission percentages (k=0.418). DAS28 and CDAI are valid and simple acceptable ways to measure RA activity in the clinical practice, but disease activity categorized by these indices differ considerably. Further research is needed to resolve this issue.

The Disease Activity Score in 28 joints (DAS28), used to assess disease activity in rheumatoid arthritis (RA), is a composite score comprising clinical, biochemical, and patient self-report measures. We hypothesized that psychological factors (cognitions and mood) would be more strongly associated with patient-reported components of the DAS28 than clinical or biochemical components. A cross-sectional, observational study of 322 RA patients with active disease (mean DAS28 6.0) awaiting therapy with a biologic agent was undertaken. Patients' illness beliefs, treatment beliefs, and mood were measured using the Brief Illness Perception Questionnaire (IPQ), the Beliefs about Medicines Questionnaire (BMQ), and the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS), respectively. Relationships between psychological factors and 1) total DAS28 and 2) individual components of the DAS28 were analyzed using linear regression. Total DAS28 produced significant but weak associations with 2 of the Brief IPQ items, but no associations with BMQ or HADS scores. There were larger significant associations between the patient-reported visual analog scale (VAS) with 5 items of the Brief IPQ and with HADS depression. Low illness coherence was associated with higher tender joint count. Three Brief IPQ items and HADS anxiety scores were significantly associated with C-reactive protein level or erythrocyte sedimentation rate. No psychological factors were associated with the swollen joint count. One of the subjective components of the DAS28, patient VAS, was highly correlated with cognitive factors and depression in those with severe RA. By reporting individual DAS28 components, clinicians may be better able to assess the impact of therapies on each component, adjusting approaches according to patients' needs.

To explore the performance of routine assessment of patient index data 3 (RAPID3) in reflecting disease activity in Chinese rheumatoid arthritis (RA) patients. The clinical data of 189 consecutive RA patients, including RAPID3 questionnaire, Disease Activity Score based on 28-joint count (DAS28), clinical disease activity index (CDAI) and simplified disease activity index (SDAI), and ultrasonography of hand and wrist joints were collected. The consistency between RAPID3 and DAS28, CDAI, SDAI in RA patients with different disease activities was performed by Spearman's correlations, kappa and/or weighted kappa coefficients. RAPID3 score was significantly associated with DAS28 and erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR), DAS28 with C-reactive protein (CRP), CDAI, SDAI (r = 0.797, 0.786, 0.784, and 0.760 respectively, P < 0.001 for all). RAPID3 was also significantly correlated with tender joint count, swollen joint count, ESR and CRP. The agreement of RAPID3 with DAS28 scoring systems was better in patients with moderate/high disease activity than those in remission/low disease activity. Ultrasonographic subclinical synovitis was presented in 42.3%-48.6% of patients in remission/low disease activity defined by various scoring criteria including RAPID3 with no significant difference observed (P = 0.22, >0.05). RAPID3 showed good correlation with DAS28 scoring systems, especially in patients with moderate/high disease activity. RAPID3 is a reliable and convenient tool to monitor disease activity.

In patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA), remission may be assessed by various composite measures. We assessed achievement of remission as defined by Boolean criteria, Simplified Disease Activity Index (SDAI), Clinical Disease Activity Index (CDAI), and 28-joint Disease Activity Score using C-reactive protein (DAS28[CRP]) and determined the components that limit patients in SDAI, CDAI, or DAS28(CRP) remission from achieving Boolean remission. The proportions of patients achieving Boolean, SDAI, CDAI, or DAS28(CRP) remission were calculated for 3 trials: PREMIER and OPTIMA in patients with early RA and DE019 in patients with established RA. At the first visit that remission was recorded during the first 52 weeks of the trial, the following were assessed: swollen/tender joint count at 28 and 66/68 joints, CRP, Patient's/Physician's Global Assessment (PGA/PhGA), SDAI, DAS28(CRP), and Health Assessment Questionnaire-Disability Index. The majority of patients (61-66%) who achieved SDAI or CDAI remission also attained Boolean remission. Although DAS28(CRP) remission was most frequently attained, 74-77% of patients in DAS28(CRP) remission did not achieve Boolean remission. Compared with patients in Boolean remission, patients in SDAI or CDAI remission but not Boolean remission had higher PGA scores, while patients with DAS28(CRP) remission but not Boolean remission had higher joint counts, and PGA and PhGA scores. Differences in PGA limit patients in SDAI/CDAI remission from meeting the Boolean remission criteria, suggesting that these criteria otherwise can be used interchangeably. In contrast, patients in DAS28(CRP) remission are limited by differences in multiple disease activity measures from achieving Boolean remission.

To investigate if autoimmune thyroid disease (AITD) impacts rheumatoid arthritis (RA) disease activity or response to methotrexate. A nationwide register-based cohort study of 9 004 patients with new-onset RA from the Swedish Rheumatology Quality Register year 2006-2016, with linkage to other nationwide registers to identify comorbidity with AITD defined as thyroxine prescription before RA diagnosis, excluding non-autoimmune causes. We compared RA disease activity using 28-joint Disease Activity Score (DAS28) and its components, and EULAR response, between patients with and without AITD, using logistic regression. At diagnosis, patient reported outcome measures (PROMs; patient global, Health Assessment Questionnaire Disability Index and pain) but not objective disease activity measures (erythrocyte sedimentation rate and swollen joint count) were significantly higher (p<0.05 for all PROMs) among RA patients with AITD compared with those without. The level of DAS28 was 5.2 vs 5.1. By contrast, AITD had little influence on EULAR response to methotrexate at 3 months (OR of non/moderate response=0.95, 95% CI 0.8 to 1.1), nor at 6 months. When stratified by age, however, AITD was more common among EULAR non/moderate responders at 3 and 6 months in patients below 45 years resulting in ORs of non/moderate response of 1.44 (0.76-2.76) and 2.75 (1.04-7.28). At diagnosis, RA patients with concomitant AITD score worse on patient reported but not on objective RA disease activity measures, while DAS28 was only marginally elevated. The overall chance of achieving a EULAR good response at 3 or 6 months remains unaffected, although among a limited subgroup of younger patients, AITD may be a predictor for an inferior primary response.

In patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA), disease severity assessment is done using Disease Activity Score in 28 joints with ESR (DAS28). Computing DAS28 is time-consuming, requires laboratory testing and an online calculator. There is a need to validate rapid methods of disease severity assessment for routine daily use. This study was conducted to compare DAS28, Clinical Disease Activity Index (CDAI), Health Assessment Questionnaire Disability Index (HAQ-DI) and Routine Assessment of Patient Index Data with 3 measures (RAPID3) to assess the disease activity in patients with RA. We prospectively studied the utility of CDAI, HAQ-DI and RAPID3 scoring in 100 consecutive newly diagnosed, disease modifying antirheumatic drugs (DMARDs) naïve adult patients with RA seen during January 2013 and June 2014 at a tertiary care teaching hospital in south India. The mean age of the patients was 42.1±11.6 yr, there were 82 females. The median [interquartile range (IQR)] symptom duration was 6 (range 4-12) months. The median (IQR) DAS28, CDAI, HAQ-DI and RAPID3 scores at presentation were 7 (6-7), 36 (28-43), 2 (1-2) and 17 (13-19), respectively. A significant positive correlation was observed between DAS28 and CDAI (r=0.568; P<0.001); DAS28 and HAQ-DI (r=0.304; P=0.002) and DAS28 and RAPID3 (r=0.404; P<0.001). A 'slight-to-fair' agreement was observed in between DAS28 and CDAI (kappa-statistic=0.296). The agreement between DAS28 and HAQ-DI (kappa-statistic=0.007) and RAPID3 (kappa-statistic=0.072) was less robust. In adult patients with RA, in the setting where illiteracy is high, CDAI emerged as the preferred choice for rapid assessment of severity of disease at the time of initial presentation.

Although there is strong evidence supporting the short-term efficacy and safety of anti-tumour necrosis factor-alpha agents, few studies have examined the long-term effects. We evaluated 511 patients with long-standing refractory rheumatoid arthritis treated with intravenous infusions of infliximab 3 mg/kg at weeks 0, 2, 6, and 14 and every 8 weeks thereafter for 4 years. Among the initial 511 patients included in the study, 479 could be evaluated; of these, 295 (61.6%) were still receiving infliximab treatment at year 4 of follow-up. The most common reasons for treatment discontinuation were lack of efficacy (65 patients, 13.6%), safety (81 patients, 16.9%), and elective change (38 patients, 7.9%). Analysis of disease activity scores (DAS28 [disease activity score based on the 28-joint count]) over time showed that, after the initial rapid improvement during the first 6 to 22 weeks of therapy, a further decrease in disease activity of 0.2 units in the DAS28 score per year was observed. DAS28 scores, measured at week 14 or 22, were found to predict subsequent discontinuation due to lack of efficacy. In conclusion, long-term maintenance therapy with infliximab 3 mg/kg is effective in producing further reductions in disease activity. Disease activity measured by the DAS28 at week 14 or 22 of infliximab therapy was the best predictor of long-term attrition.

Stringent remission criteria are crucial in rheumatoid arthritis (RA) assessment. Disease activity score in 28 joints (DAS28)-remission has not been included among American College of Rheumatology/European League Against Rheumatism definitions, because of its association with significant residual disease activity, partly due to high weighting of acute-phase reactants (APR). New, more stringent cut-points for DAS28-remission have recently been proposed that are suggested to reflect remission by clinical and simplified disease activity indices (clinical disease activity index (CDAI), simple disease activity index (SDAI)). However, their stringency in therapies directly influencing APR, like IL-6-blockers, has not been tested. We tested the new cut-points in patients with RA receiving tocilizumab. We used data from randomised controlled trials of tocilizumab and evaluated patients in remission according to new DAS28-C-reactive protein (DAS-CRP) and DAS-erythrocyte sedimentation rate (DAS-ESR) cut-points (1.9 and 2.2). We assessed their disease activity state using the CDAI, SDAI and Boolean criteria and analysed their individual residual core set variables, like swollen joint counts (SJC28). About 50% of patients in DAS28-CRP-remission (<1.9) fell into higher disease activity states when assessed with CDAI, SDAI or Boolean criteria. Also, 15% had three or more (up to eight) SJC. Even higher disease activity was seen in patients classified as being in DAS28-ESR-remission (<2.2). Even with new, more stringent cut-points, DAS28-remission is frequently associated with considerable residual clinical disease activity, indicating that this limitation of the DAS28 is related to score construction rather than the choice of cut-points.

To determine whether using a reweighted disease activity score that better reflects joint synovitis, i.e., the 2-component Disease Activity Score in 28 joints (DAS28) (based on swollen joint count and C-reactive protein level), produces more clinically relevant treatment outcome trajectories compared to the standard 4-component DAS28. Latent class mixed modeling of response to biologic treatment was applied to 2,991 rheumatoid arthritis (RA) patients in whom treatment with a biologic disease-modifying antirheumatic drug was being initiated within the Biologics in Rheumatoid Arthritis Genetics and Genomics Study Syndicate cohort, using both 4-component and 2-component DAS28 scores as outcome measures. Patient groups with similar trajectories were compared in terms of pretreatment baseline characteristics (including disability and comorbidities) and follow-up characteristics (including antidrug antibody events, adherence to treatments, and blood drug levels). We compared the trajectories obtained using the 4- and 2-component scores to determine which characteristics were better captured by each. Using the 4-component DAS28, we identified 3 trajectory groups, which is consistent with previous findings. We showed that the 4-component DAS28 captures information relating to depression. Using the 2-component DAS28, 7 trajectory groups were identified; among them, distinct groups of nonresponders had a higher incidence of respiratory comorbidities and a higher proportion of antidrug antibody events. We also identified a group of patients for whom the 2-component DAS28 scores remained relatively low; this group included a high percentage of patients who were nonadherent to treatment. This highlights the utility of both the 4- and 2-component DAS28 for monitoring different components of disease activity. Here we show that the 2-component modified DAS28 defines important biologic and clinical phenotypes associated with treatment outcome in RA and characterizes important underlying response mechanisms to biologic drugs.

To determine the effects of tocilizumab on rheumatoid arthritis (RA) disease activity and remission assessment, using measures that do or do not comprise acute-phase reactants. Simplified Disease Activity Index (SDAI) scores, Clinical Disease Activity Index (CDAI) scores, and the Disease Activity Score in 28 joints (DAS28) were calculated using data from tocilizumab trials in patients with RA in whom disease had remained active despite treatment with disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs. The CDAI does not contain an acute-phase reactant component. Disease activity states, including remission, were defined using established cut points; for the DAS28, an alternative cut point of <2.4 was also used. Changes in the DAS28, the SDAI score, and the CDAI score among patients receiving tocilizumab were significantly higher than those among patients receiving placebo, and the magnitude of these changes was similar for the SDAI and the CDAI. Among patients who achieved 50% improvement in disease activity according to the American College of Rheumatology criteria, only ∼20% required a reduction in acute-phase reactant values in order to fulfill the criteria. However, DAS28 remission rates were higher (even when using the lower cut point) than the SDAI and CDAI remission rates. Only a minority of tocilizumab-treated patients with DAS28 remission also had disease remission according to the SDAI (26%) or CDAI (∼21%). With infliximab treatment, SDAI and CDAI remission rates were of the same magnitude as those observed with tocilizumab treatment, and DAS28 remission rates were lower. Tocilizumab-treated patients with DAS28 remission but without CDAI remission had significantly higher swollen joint counts but lower erythrocyte sedimentation rates (ESRs) compared with patients with SDAI or CDAI remission. Disease activity in RA is reduced by tocilizumab treatment, irrespective of the type of composite measure used to evaluate disease activity. Remission rates were much higher using the DAS28 compared with the SDAI and CDAI, due to the high weight of the ESR in the DAS28 and the effect of tocilizumab on the ESR. Using the stringent SDAI and CDAI criteria, however, remission rates in patients treated with tocilizumab were in the same range as those seen in patients treated with tumor necrosis factor inhibitors.

The Disease Activity Score (DAS) is integral in tailoring the clinical management of rheumatoid arthritis (RA) patients and is an important measure in clinical research. Different versions have been developed over the years to improve reliability and ease of use. Combining the original DAS and the newer DAS28 data in both contemporary and historical studies is important for both primary and secondary data analyses. As such, a methodologically robust means of converting the old DAS to the new DAS28 measure would be invaluable. Using data from The Early RA Study (ERAS), a sub-sample of patients with both DAS and DAS28 data were used to develop new regression imputation formulas using the total DAS score (univariate), and using the separate components of the DAS score (multivariate). DAS were transformed to DAS28 using an existing formula quoted in the literature, and the newly developed formulas. Bland and Altman plots were used to compare the transformed DAS with the recorded DAS28 to ascertain levels of agreement. The current transformation formula tended to overestimate the true DAS28 score, particularly at the higher end of the scale. A formula which uses all separate components of the DAS was found to estimate the scores with a higher level of precision. A new formula is proposed that can be used by other early RA cohorts to convert the original DAS to DAS28.

To study the extent to which muscle strength and performance, pain, and disease activity are associated with the total Health Assessment Questionnaire (HAQ) disability index and its subdimensions in male and female patients with rheumatoid arthritis. HAQ for functional capacity was completed by 135 patients with rheumatoid arthritis referred for orthopaedic surgery (74% women; mean (SD) age 62 (10) years; disease duration 19 (13) years, 70% positive for rheumatoid factor). Knee extension, trunk extension and flexion, grip strength, walking speed, and sit-to-stand test were measured to mirror physical function. Radiographs of hands and feet, pain, and the modified 28 joint disease activity score (DAS28) were also assessed. Mean total HAQ was 1.08 (0.68) in women and 0.67 (0.70) in men (p = 0.0031). Women had greater disability than men in five of the eight subdimensions of the HAQ. Grip strength was 48%, knee extension strength 46%, trunk extension strength 54%, and trunk flexion strength 43% lower in women than in men. Knee extension strength was inversely correlated with walking time (r = -0.63 (95% confidence interval, -0.73 to -0.51)) and with sit-to-stand test (r = -0.47 (-0.60 to -0.31)). In an ordered logistic regression analysis in female rheumatoid patients, DAS28, pain, knee extension strength, and grip strength were associated with the total HAQ disability index. Women reported greater disability than men both in the total HAQ and in the majority of its eight subdimensions. In addition to disease activity and pain, muscle strength has a major impact on disability especially in female rheumatoid patients.

The 28-joint Disease Activity Score (DAS28) combines scores on a 28-tender and swollen joint count (TJC28 and SJC28), a patient-reported measure for general health (GH), and an inflammatory marker (either the erythrocyte sedimentation rate [ESR] or the C-reactive protein [CRP]) into a composite measure of disease activity in rheumatoid arthritis (RA). This study examined the reliability of the DAS28 in patients with early RA using principles from generalizability theory and evaluated whether it could be increased by adjusting individual DAS28 component weights. Patients were drawn from the DREAM registry and classified into a "fast response" group (N = 466) and "slow response" group (N = 80), depending on their pace of reaching remission. Composite reliabilities of the DAS28-ESR and DAS28-CRP were determined with the individual components' reliability, weights, variances, error variances, correlations and covariances. Weight optimization was performed by minimizing the error variance of the index. Composite reliabilities of 0.85 and 0.86 were found for the DAS28-ESR and DAS28-CRP, respectively, and were approximately equal across patients groups. Component reliabilities, however, varied widely both within and between sub-groups, ranging from 0.614 for GH ("slow response" group) to 0.912 for ESR ("fast response" group). Weight optimization increased composite reliability even further. In the total and "fast response" groups, this was achieved mostly by decreasing the weight of the TJC28 and GH. In the "slow response" group, though, the weights of the TJC28 and SJC28 were increased, while those of the inflammatory markers and GH were substantially decreased. The DAS28-ESR and the DAS28-CRP are reliable instruments for assessing disease activity in early RA and reliability can be increased even further by adjusting component weights. Given the low reliability and weightings of the general health component across subgroups it is recommended to explore alternative patient-reported outcome measures for inclusion in the DAS28.

The Disease Activity Score based on 28 joints (DAS28) has been increasingly used in clinical practice and research studies of rheumatoid arthritis (RA). Studies have reported discordance between DAS28 based on erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) versus C-reactive protein (CRP) in patients with RA. However, such comparison is lacking in African Americans with RA. This analysis included participants from the Consortium for the Longitudinal Evaluation of African Americans with Early Rheumatoid Arthritis (CLEAR) registry, which enrolls self-declared African Americans with RA. Using tender and swollen joint counts, separate ESR-based and CRP-based DAS28 scores (DAS28-ESR3 and DAS28-CRP3) were calculated, as were DAS28-ESR4 and DAS28-CRP4, which included the patient's assessment of disease activity. The scores were compared using paired t-test, simple agreement and κ, correlation coefficient, and Bland-Altman plots. Of the 233 included participants, 85% were women, mean age at enrollment was 52.6 years, and median disease duration at enrollment was 21 months. Mean DAS28-ESR3 was significantly higher than DAS28-CRP3 (4.8 vs 3.9; p < 0.001). Similarly, mean DAS28-ESR4 was significantly higher than DAS28-CRP4 (4.7 vs 3.9; p < 0.001). ESR-based DAS28 remained higher than CRP-based DAS28 even when stratified by age, sex, and disease duration. Overall agreement was not high between DAS28-ESR3 and DAS28-CRP3 (50%) or between DAS28-ESR4 and DAS28-CRP4 (59%). DAS28-CRP3 underestimated disease activity in 47% of the participants relative to DAS28-ESR3 and DAS28-CRP4 in 40% of the participants relative to DAS28-ESR4. There was significant discordance between the ESR-based and CRP-based DAS28, a situation that could affect clinical treatment decisions for African Americans with RA.

There has been continuous debate regarding the applicability of various composite measures for the assessment of disease activity in rheumatoid arthritis (RA). In order to further dissect this issue, we numerically and graphically modeled 28-joint disease activity scale (DAS28), simplified disease activity index (SDAI), and clinical disease activity index (CDAI) by three-dimensional (3D) plotting. We wished to graphically visualize the relative contribution of various elements in the three activity indices to each other. We calculated DAS28 (3 variables), SDAI, and CDAI by the standard equations. We plotted 3D "carpets" showing all combinations of the corresponding variables yielding to DAS28 = 5.1, DAS28 = 3.2, DAS28 = 2.6, SDAI = 26, SDAI = 11, and SDAI = 3.3. We also plotted the 3D carpet for CDAI. In patients with high or moderate disease activity, erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) or C-reactive protein (CRP) was not a major confounding factor when calculating DAS28 and SDAI, respectively. In contrast, ESR and CRP highly overshadowed changes in joint counts and global assessments in patients with low disease activity (LDA) or those in remission. No reliable assessment of LDA can be performed in cases where ESR >54 mm/h or CRP >20 mg/dl. Similarly, remission cannot be determined if ESR >19 mm/h or CRP >5 mg/dl. As CDAI does not include acute phase reactants, CDAI may be a useful tool even in states of remission or LDA. Our results suggest that acute phase reactants are indeed major confounding factors and should be omitted when assessing RA disease activity at least in special cases.

The aim of this study was to determine a low disease activity threshold--a 28-joint disease activity score (DAS28) value--for the decision to maintain unchanged disease-modifying antirheumatic drug (DMARD) treatment in rheumatoid arthritis patients, based on expert opinion. Nine hundred and sixty-seven case scenarios with various levels for each component of the DAS28 (resulting in a disease activity score between 2 and 3.2) were presented to 44 panelists. For each scenario, panelists had to decide whether or not DMARD treatment (excluding steroids) could be maintained unchanged. In each scenario, for decision, the participants were given the DAS28 parameters, without knowledge of the resultant DAS28. The relationship between panelists' decision, DAS28 value, and components of the score were analysed by multiple logistic regression analysis. Each panelist analysed 160 randomised scenarios. Intra-rater and inter-rater reproducibility were assessed. Forty-four panelists participated in the study. Inter-panelist agreement was good (kappa = 0.63; 95% confidence interval = 0.61 to 0.65). Intra-panelist agreement was excellent (kappa = 0.87; 95% confidence interval = 0.82 to 0.92). Quasi-perfect agreement was observed for DAS28 < or = 2.4, less pronounced between 2.5 and 2.9, and almost no agreement for DAS28 > 3.0. For values below 2.5, panelists agreed to maintain unchanged DMARDs; for values above 2.5, discrepancies occurred more frequently as the DAS28 value increased. Multivariate analysis confirmed the relationship between panelist's decision, DAS28 value and components of the DAS28. Between DAS28 of 2.4 and 3.2, a major determinant for panelists' decision was swollen joint count. Female and public practice physicians decided more often to maintain treatment unchanged. As a conclusion, panelists suggested that in clinical practice there is no need to change DMARD treatment in rheumatoid arthritis patients with DAS28 < or = 2.4.

To investigate whether remission can be sustained for rheumatoid arthritis (RA) patients after tapering abatacept (ABT). All patients were naïve to biological disease-modifying anti-rheumatic drugs (bDMARDs) and in low or moderate Disease Activity Score of 28 joints with C-reactive protein (DAS)28-CRP). ABT was administrated intravenously (IV) or subcutaneously (SC) for 36 weeks to patients with RA, who had not previously received bDMARDs. As the ABT tapering protocol, ABT was administrated SC at 125 mg every 2 weeks for 12 weeks in patients with remission. RA disease activity was assessed by DAS28-CRP and ultrasonography. Remission was assessed by defining it as DAS28-CRP <2.3. Of the 51 patients, 84.3% were women (mean age 68.7 ± 10.2 years, mean disease duration 7.7 ± 10.2 years). Twenty-nine patients achieved remission and a power Doppler (PD) score ≤1 at each joint at 36 weeks, followed by tapering ABT. Of these patients, 25 sustained DAS28-CRP remission, and DAS28-CRP was not significantly elevated (1.62 ± 0.41 to 1.69 ± 0.49) at 48 weeks, but the total PD score was significantly elevated (1.52 ± 1.21 to 2.59 ± 2.81 P = 0.049). Longer disease duration, higher DAS28-CRP at 24 weeks, and higher total PD score at 24 weeks were predictors of an elevated total PD score after tapering ABT therapy. These findings suggest that ABT tapering is a promising short-term strategy to sustain remission in patients with RA, and ultrasonography is a useful tool for monitoring disease activity after tapering ABT.

To explore the relationship between rheumatoid arthritis (RA) disease activity and functional disability over time, considering indirect (predictive) and direct (concurrent) associations as well as the influence of radiographic joint damage and treatment strategy. Functional disability [Health Assessment Questionnaire (HAQ)], disease activity [28-joint Disease Activity Score (DAS28)], and radiographic joint damage [Sharp/van der Heijde score (SHS)] were measured in 4 consecutive randomized controlled trials with increasingly intensive (tight control) treatment strategies. Average followup time for the 3 cohorts was 97, 53, and 50 months, respectively. Next to current DAS28, the previous DAS28 was used to study the predictive effect of a change in DAS28 on progression of functional disability (HAQ). Finally, it was investigated whether SHS mediated the predictive effect of DAS28. In patients treated with intensive treatment strategies, the progression of HAQ over time was statistically significantly less (p < 0.0001). The predictive influence of DAS28 on HAQ progression increased over the duration of the disease. SHS was not found to influence HAQ progression and did not mediate the predictive effect of DAS28. In the less intensively treated patients, the direct effect of disease activity decreased with disease duration, and contrarily, SHS did influence HAQ progression, but was not found to (fully) mediate the predictive effect of DAS28. In patients with RA treated with modern treatment strategies, there is less functional decline over time. Further, disease activity does predict functional decline but joint damage does not. This might indicate that factors associated with cumulative disease activity but not visible on radiographs can influence functional decline in patients with RA. This further underlines the importance of disease activity as a treatment target in early RA and in established RA.

To obtain the simplest definition of minimal disease activity (MDA) and to compare it with published proposed definitions of MDA in patients with RA. Two hundred and fourteen patients with long-standing RA (LSRA) were evaluated for clinical and laboratory parameters. Factor analysis was performed to remove redundant variables included in the core set measure for MDA definition stated by the OMERACT. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves analysis allowed to obtain optimal cut-off predictors of a 28-joint disease activity score (DAS28) < or =2.85. These were tested in 112 LSRA and 95 early-onset RA (ERA) patients. Factor and ROC curve analysis showed that the best predictors of a DAS28 < or = 2.85 in LSRA cohort were: (i) ESR <20 mm/h (sensitivity: 80%, specificity: 54%); (ii) swollen joint count (out of 28) < or =2 (sensitivity: 95%, specificity: 74%); (iii) patient global assessment (0-100) < or =15 (sensitivity: 78%, specificity: 78%); and (iv) HAQ (0-3) < or =0.5 (sensitivity: 91%, specificity: 61%). To each of these four criteria we assigned a value of 1 when it was satisfied (score ranging: 0-4). The cut-off with the highest overall accuracy for identifying RA patients with DAS28 < or = 2.85 was a score > or =3. We adopted these four parameters in order to define the residual MDA (RMDA). Comparing RMDA criteria, in distinct 112 LSRA and 95 ERA patients, with OMERACT, Simplified Disease Activity Index and Clinical Disease Activity Index definitions of MDA, we found a good agreement in the LSRA cohort and moderate agreement in the ERA cohort. HAQ, PaGA, SJC28 and ESR allow identification of RA patients with an RMDA. The RMDA criteria behaves similarly to OMERACT definitions, but appears more simple and feasible.

This study is based on the results from a Belgian expanded access program in which patients with active refractory and erosive rheumatoid arthritis (RA) were treated with intravenous infusions of infliximab in combination with methotrexate. The objectives of this study were to evaluate the continuation rate of infliximab and its clinical effect over a 7-year period and to document the reasons for discontinuation. Between 2000 and 2001, 511 patients with severe and refractory RA were enrolled and treated with infliximab. After 7 years, apart from routine clinical follow-up, treating rheumatologists were asked to complete a questionnaire designed specifically for the present study to evaluate the current therapy with infliximab, the level of disease activity (Disease Activity Score in 28 joints [DAS28]) and the reasons for infliximab discontinuation. After 7 years, 160 of 511 patients (31%) were still on infliximab treatment. The major reasons for infliximab discontinuation included lack of efficacy (104 patients), adverse events (107 patients) and elective change of therapy (70 patients). The majority of cases of treatment discontinuation for safety reasons occurred during the first 2 years. In contrast, discontinuation due to ineffectiveness showed a more constant rate over the 7-year period. Mean DAS for patients still on treatment with infliximab decreased from 5.7 (standard error [SE] 0.1) at baseline to 3.0 (SE 0.1) at year 4 and remained that low until year 7 (3.0 [SE 0.1]). Low disease activity (defined as DAS28<3.2) was present in 60.9% of patients, and 45.5% achieved remission (DAS28<2.6). DAS28 at the time of treatment discontinuation due to ineffectiveness decreased over the 7-year period from 5.6 (SE 0.3) in 2001 to 4.8 (SE 0.3) in 2008. This observational study revealed that patients who continue to receive infliximab experience sustained clinical benefit. The majority of safety issues occurred during the first 2 years of infliximab therapy. We observed that the DAS at the time of therapy discontinuation showed a trend to decrease over time.

To determine the contribution of fibromyalgia (FM) to the subjective components of the Disease Activity Score 28-joints (DAS28) in patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA), and to analyse the discriminatory performance of the derived DAS28 patient-reported components (DAS28-P) to identify patients with fibromyalgic RA. Consecutive RA patients underwent clinical and clinimetric assessment. The DAS28-P index was derived from the components of the DAS28 scores by rearranging the DAS28-ESR formula. Patients were distinguished by the presence of FM. Student parametric t tests or Mann-Whitney non-parametric U tests were used to determine any between-group differences. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis was used to test the ability of the DAS28-P index to distinguish patients with RA and those with fibromyalgic RA. The study involved 292 RA patients (80.5% females, mean age 63 years) with a mean disease duration of 11.6 ± 8.5 years. Forty-three patients (14.7%) had concomitant FM, and significantly higher tender joint count (p < 0.001), pain numerical rating scale, global health status (p = 0.007), and DAS28 scores (p = 0.006) than those without FM. The DAS28-P values were also significantly higher in the patients with FM (0.68 ± 0.09 vs 0.58 ± 0.06; p < 0.001). The discriminatory power of the DAS28-P was very good (area under the ROC of 0.858, optimal cut-off value of 0.631). The presence of FM strongly influences the DAS28 results. The assessment of patient-reported components to the DAS28 through the DAS28-P can be a useful way to identify patients with fibromyalgic RA.

To examine the influence of components of the Disease Activity Score 28 (DAS28) [tender joint count (TJC), swollen joint count (SJC), patient's general health (GH), and erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR)] on the total DAS28 score, and overlapping of the 4 individual components in rheumatoid arthritis (RA) patients with low, moderate, or high disease activity. The effect of each component was studied in the FIN-RACo trial patients at 6 months and in a "theoretical model," where each component of the DAS28 ranged as follows: TJC and SJC from 0 to 28, GH from 0 to 100, and ESR from 1 to 100, while the other 3 components were 0 (ESR1). Overlapping of the components was studied in the FIN-RACo trial patients at 6 months with low (DAS28 < or = 3.2), moderate (DAS28 > 3.2 and < or = 5.1), and high (DAS28 > 5.1) disease activity. The higher limit for overlapping was defined as the highest SJC in the low disease activity group, and the lower limit as the lowest SJC in the high disease activity group; the percentage of patients who fall between these limits represent overlapping in SJC. Overlapping was calculated similarly concerning TJC, ESR, and GH. ESR had the greatest effect on DAS28, followed by TJC, GH, and SJC, while in the "theoretical model" TJC had the greatest effect on the DAS28, followed by ESR, SJC, and GH. At 6 months, overlapping was present in 54%, 45%, 49%, and 31% of patients in SJC, TJC, GH, and ESR, respectively. In real-life patients, ESR had the greatest effect of the 4 components of DAS28 on the total DAS28 score. The values of the individual components of DAS28 overlap considerably among the 3 disease activity groups.

To evaluate the application of Disease Activity Score 28 (DAS28) to assess joint involvement in Systemic Lupus Erythematosus (SLE). Sixty-nine SLE patients, complaining of joint symptoms, and 44 rheumatoid arthritis (RA) patients were enrolled. In SLE patients disease activity was assessed with SLEDAI-2K. DAS28 was calculated in all the patients. Thirty SLE patients (43.5%) showed clinical signs of arthritis. Mean DAS28 was 4.0±1.4, 22 patients (31.9%) had low disease activity, 29 (42.0%) moderate, and 18 (26.1%) high. We dichotomized SLE patients according to the presence (Group 1) or absence (Group 2) of articular involvement according to SLEDAI-2K: 56.3% of the patients of the second group had a moderate/high activity according to DAS28. We compared SLE patients with 44 RA patients (M/F 9/35, mean age 55.6±14.5 years; mean disease duration 140.4±105.6 months). No significant differences were found regarding the values of DAS28 between SLE and RA patients. On the contrary, the values of tender and swollen joint count were significantly higher in RA compared to SLE patients (P=0.0002 and P=0.0001, resp.). We suggest the use of the DAS28 in the assessment of joint involvement in SLE patients.

Disease Activity Score in 28 Joints (DAS28) is a scoring system to evaluate disease activity and treatment response in rheumatoid arthritis (RA). A DAS28 score of greater than 3.2 is a well-described limit for treatment intensification; however, the reliability of DAS28 might be overestimated. The aim of this study was to evaluate the reliability of DAS28 in RA, especially focusing on a subgroup of patients with a DAS28 score of greater than 3.2. Data from RA patients registered in the local part of Danish DANBIO Registry were collected in May 2015. Patients were categorized into 2 groups: First, those with DAS28 >3.2 with at least one swollen joint (SJ) or elevated C-reactive protein (CRP) ("objective group"), and second, patients with a DAS28 >3.2 who had no SJ, and CRP values were within the reference range ("subjective group"). Disease Activity Score in 28 Joints, Clinical Disease Activity Index, and Health Assessment Questionnaire scores were calculated for each group. We defined new score, DAS28 subjective, to focus on subjective parameters. Two hundred thirty patients were included; 198 (86.1%) and 32 (13.9%) patients were in the objective and subjective groups, respectively. Patients in the subjective group had lower mean values of DAS28 (P < 0.001) and Evaluator Global Assessment (P < 0.001) with less common immunoglobulin M rheumatoid factor (P < 0.001) and anti-cyclic citrullinated peptide positivity (P = 0.02) and contrarily higher mean values of tender joints (P = 0.04) and DAS28 based on subjective parameters (P = 0.003) compared with the objective group. Rheumatoid arthritis scoring systems should be used cautiously in patients who are considered for treatment intensification. Patients with central sensitization and psychological problems and those with false-positive diagnosis of RA are at high risk of overtreatment.

Activity of rheumatoid arthritis (RA) can be evaluated using several scoring scales based on clinical features. The most widely used one is the Disease Activity Score involving 28 joint counts (DAS28) for which cut-offs were proposed to help physicians classify patients. However, inaccurate scoring can lead to inappropriate medical decisions. In this article some methodological issues in the design of such a score and its cut-offs are highlighted in order to further propose a strategy to overcome them. As long as the issues reviewed in this article are not addressed, results of studies based on standard disease activity scores such as DAS28 should be considered with caution.

Ankle joints are frequently neglected in activity scoring systems, including the Disease Activity Score in 28 joints (DAS28). Only a few studies have assessed pathologies detected by ultrasonography of the ankles in symptomatic rheumatoid arthritis (RA) patients. We evaluated ankle joints in RA patients regardless of symptomatology, using musculoskeletal ultrasound (MSUS) as well as power Doppler ultrasound (PDUS). A total of 160 ankle joints of 80 RA patients were examined using MSUS and PDUS, according to the European League Against Rheumatism MSUS guidelines. Additionally, the talonavicular joints (TNJs) and the medial and the lateral tendon compartments were examined. The visual analog scale (VAS) score was recorded for each patient. A total of 80 RA patients with a median age of 60 years and disease duration of 5 years were enrolled in our study. The median DAS28 score was 5. A total of 97 ankles were painful (VAS 1-10), whereas 63 ankles were asymptomatic (VAS 0). Overall, the predominant pathology was arthritis of the tibiotalar joint (TTJ) and/or TNJ in 124 ankles (77%), followed by tenosynovitis of the medial compartment tendons in 44 ankles (28%). Arthritis of the TTJ was present in 59% and synovitis of the TNJ in 35% of the symptomatic ankles. In asymptomatic ankles, TTJ synovitis was detected in 35%, whereas TNJ arthritis was observed in 18%. PDUS activity was higher in the subgroup of symptomatic ankles. The most frequent pathologies detected by MSUS were arthritis of the TTJ and TNJ, followed by tenosynovitis of the medial compartment tendons. Pathologic findings were more frequent in symptomatic but also common in asymptomatic patients, whereas PDUS activity was generally low and mainly observed in symptomatic patients.

Disease Activity Score in 28 joints calculated with C-reactive protein (DAS28-CRP) is used instead of erythrocyte sedimentation rate (DAS28-ESR) to assess rheumatoid arthritis disease activity; however, values for remission and low disease activity (LDA) for DAS28-CRP have not been validated. American College of Rheumatology/European League Against Rheumatism (ACR/EULAR) guidelines suggest remission should be calculated by Simplified Disease Activity Index (SDAI) rather than DAS28-ESR. We examined values of remission and LDA of DAS28-CRP that correspond to the respective cut-off points for DAS28-ESR and SDAI from five clinical trials. DAS28-CRP cut-offs that best correspond to DAS28-ESR remission <2.6 and LDA ≤3.2 were obtained by cumulative distribution plots, receiver operating curves and maximum concordance and averaged for each approach, treatment group and study. Level of agreement between DAS28-CRP and DAS28-ESR remission and LDA cut-offs was compared against each other and versus SDAI remission ≤3.3 and LDA ≤11. Percentage of patients who achieved remission and LDA by DAS28-ESR cut-offs was greater for DAS28-CRP versus DAS28-ESR regardless of patient population or treatment group. Discordance between CRP and ESR cut-offs ranged from 4%-26% and 8%-23% for remission and LDA, respectively, and 19%-40% and 6%-11% for DAS28-CRP versus SDAI, respectively. Estimated (range) remission and LDA thresholds were 2.4 (2.2-2.6) and 2.9 (2.6-3.3), 1.9 (1.6-2.2) and 3.1 (3.1-3.3) and 2.2 (1.1-2.9) and 3.6 (3.4-4.0) for DAS28-CRP versus DAS28-ESR, DAS28-CRP versus SDAI and DAS28-ESR versus SDAI, respectively. DAS28-CRP underestimates disease activity when using cut-off points validated for DAS28-ESR; therefore, DAS28-ESR cut-off values should not be applied to DAS28-CRP. Although DAS28-CRP and DAS28-ESR cut-offs for LDA ≤3.2 correspond to SDAI LDA, neither corresponds well to SDAI remission.

The Disease Activity Score based on 28 joints (DAS28) has been widely used in clinical practice and research studies of rheumatoid arthritis (RA). The objective of this study was to evaluate the discordance in the DAS28 based on the erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) versus C-reactive protein (CRP) levels in Korean patients with RA. From August to December 2011, 540 patients with RA who visited two rheumatology clinics affiliated with Hallym University (Korea) and had at least one DAS28 evaluation were examined. The mean age of the included patients was 53 years, and 82% were female. The mean duration of disease was 32.9 ± 41.2 months. The mean DAS28-ESR was higher than the DAS28-CRP (3.65 vs. 3.44; P < 0.001). In the DAS28-ESR group, 126 patients (23.3%) satisfied the criteria for remission versus 134 (24.8%) in the DAS28-CRP group. High disease activity was determined in 80 (14.8%) patients in the DAS28-ESR group and in 43 (8.0%) in the DAS28-CRP group. A comparison of the two groups with respect to four DAS28 disease activity categories showed agreement in 344 patients (63.7%; κ = 0.45). In classifying patients as European League Against Rheumatism (EULAR) responders, agreement between the two methods was shown in 56 patients (71.8%; κ = 0.76). When disagreements between the two scores occurred, more patients had a better EULAR response based on the DAS28-ESR than on the DAS28-CRP (19.2% vs. 8.9%, respectively). The discordance between the ESR-based and CRP-based DAS28 could affect clinical treatment decisions for patients with RA.

We retrospectively investigated the inhibitory effect on radiographic joint damage (RJD) for non-biological disease-modifying antirheumatic drug (non-bioDMARD) monotherapy or methotrexate (MTX) combination therapy for rheumatoid arthritis (RA) in the disease activity score with 28 joint counts with erythrocyte sedimentation rate (DAS28) remission. Eighty-four patients (55 cases of monotherapy, 29 cases of MTX-combination therapy) in DAS28 remission (DAS28 ≤ 2.6) were investigated from 538 RA patients newly registered between February 2007 and August 2010. The patients were analyzed for radiological assessments using the modified total Sharp score/year (mTSS/y). The remission rates and ΔmTSS/y for each agent using monotherapy were 7.1% and 0.17 for sulfasalazine; 11.9% and 0.49 for bucillamine (BUC); and 23.9% and 2.06 for MTX. Those using combination therapy were 6.8% and 1.39 for MTX + BUC; 23.5% and -1.64 for MTX + leflunomide; and 8.0% and 0.31 for MTX + tacrolimus. The cumulative distribution in the single and combination therapy groups showed improvement of percentages in structural remission from baseline to 1-year treatment, 34.1% to 60.9% (P < 0.05) and from 0% to 56.7%(P < 0.0001), respectively. Baseline mTSS (r = 0.67, P < 0.0001), disease duration (r = 0.40, P < 0.01), swollen joint counts (r = 0.33, P < 0.05), and anti-cyclic citrullinated peptide antibody (r = 0.31, P < 0.05) were useful predictors of RJD for non-bioDMARD monotherapy, but not for combination therapy. Satisfactory inhibition of RJD was observed in the DAS28 remission cases of monotherapy or MTX combination therapy with a non-bioDMARD.

To optimize use of the Disease Activity Score in 28 joints (DAS28) in early rheumatoid arthritis (RA) by adding the "squeeze test" of forefeet. The squeeze test is used to examine bilateral compression pain (BCP) across the metatarsophalangeal (MTP) joints. For this study, data for patients participating in the Treatment in the Rotterdam Early Arthritis Cohort study, an ongoing clinical trial that evaluates different induction therapies in patients with early RA, were randomly divided into 2 subsets. In subset 1 (149 patients and 819 disease activity assessments), the mathematical function of the DAS28-squeeze was constructed using a linear regression model with the DAS as the dependent variable and the DAS28 and squeeze test as the independent variables. A DAS28-BCP disease state was also constructed, in which DAS28 disease state categorizations were upgraded one state if the result of the squeeze test was positive. In subset 2 (153 patients and 754 assessments), concordance in disease states between the DAS28, DAS28-squeeze, and DAS28-BCP disease states was compared, using both the DAS and Boolean-defined remission criteria as reference. Agreement between the DAS and the DAS28-squeeze (82%) was significantly higher than agreement between the DAS and the DAS28 (76%). When we assessed the group of patients who had arthritis of the forefeet only (22 patients and 46 assessments), overall agreement between the DAS and the DAS28 was 40%, while agreement between the DAS and the DAS28-squeeze was 59% and that between the DAS and the DAS28-BCP disease state was 65%. Furthermore, the specificities of the DAS28-squeeze and the DAS28-BCP (80% and 81%, respectively) were higher than that of the DAS28 (76%), while the sensitivities of the DAS28, DAS28-squeeze, and DAS28-BCP to identify true remission according to the Boolean criteria were 88%, 87%, and 81%, respectively. Adding the squeeze test of forefeet to the DAS28 has value for dependably classifying the disease state in patients with early RA.
