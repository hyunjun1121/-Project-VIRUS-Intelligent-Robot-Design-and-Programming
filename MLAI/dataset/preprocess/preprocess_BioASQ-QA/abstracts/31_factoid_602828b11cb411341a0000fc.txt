Camrelizumab is a promising anti-programmed cell death-1 agent for non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) and induces reactive capillary hemangiomas (RCHs). Routine clinical management of this unique and prevalent toxicity has been summarized in previous studies. The objective of this study was to provide evidence of apatinib as a salvage therapy for RCHs. In this single-center, observational study, patients with NSCLC who were over 18 years of age and treated with camrelizumab were enrolled. The incidence of RCHs, onset and duration time, severity, evolution, and clinical practices, especially with apatinib, for their management and impact on quality of life, were recorded during a 6-month follow-up. A total of 28 patients were included. The incidence of RCHs was 28.6% (8/28). The median onset and duration time were 6 weeks and 8 weeks, respectively. Six (21.4%) patients had mild and moderate RCHs and four (9.3%) patients achieved a rapid regression of RCHs with the application of apatinib. The impact of the RCHs on quality of life was limited and assessed with Dermatology Life Quality Index scores. No treatment-associated termination was observed. The combination of camrelizumab and apatinib in the treatment of NSCLC reduced the incidence of RCHs. Apatinib appeared to be a salvage therapy of RCHs, which leads to rapid regression of RCHs with no impairment on the quality of life.

The present study evaluated the safety and efficacy of camrelizumab (a programmed death-1 antibody) in combination with microwave ablation (MWA) in advanced non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). A total of 21 patients were prospectively enrolled. MWA was performed in 25 pulmonary lesions during 21 sessions. Camrelizumab was administered 5-7 days after MWA as a dose of 200 mg, which was repeated every 2 weeks until disease progression or intolerable toxicities. The primary endpoints were safety and the objective response rate (ORR). Other endpoints included progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS). The technical success rate was 100%. No treatment-associated deaths were identified. Major complications, minor complications, and side effects of MWA were observed in 9, 8, and 14 patients, respectively. The main major complications included pneumothorax, pneumonia, hemorrhage, and pleural effusion. The adverse events of camrelizumab included reactive skin capillary hyperplasia (n = 9), hypothyroidism (n = 5), pneumonia (n = 4), fatigue (n = 2), leukopenia (n = 1), and neutropenia (n = 1). Grade 2 and 3 camrelizumab adverse events were identified in eight and three patients, respectively. The ORR was 33.3%, with two patients achieving complete response and five patients achieving partial response. The median PFS was 5.1 months and OS was not reached. Camrelizumab administration combined with MWA was safe in the treatment of advanced NSCLC, and the combination improved the ORR of camrelizumab alone compared to previous reports.

Platinum-based doublet chemotherapy regimens, preferentially gemcitabine plus cisplatin, are generally considered the first-line standard of care for patients with recurrent or metastatic nasopharyngeal carcinoma. However, no consensus has been reached regarding treatment following progression after first-line therapy. Camrelizumab (SHR-1210) is a humanised anti-programmed death-1 (anti PD-1) antibody. We present safety and preliminary antitumour activity of camrelizumab alone as second-line therapy in patients with recurrent or metastatic nasopharyngeal carcinoma and combined with gemcitabine and cisplatin as first-line therapy in this patient population. We report the results from two single-arm, phase 1 trials. Both trials included patients aged 18-70 years with histologically or cytologically confirmed nasopharyngeal carcinoma and confirmed metastatic disease or locoreginal recurrence, and an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status of 0 or 1. Patients who received at least one previous line of treatment were enrolled at five academic hospitals in China into the dose-escalation and expansion trial to receive camrelizumab monotherapy intravenously at escalating doses of 1 mg/kg, 3 mg/kg, and 10 mg/kg, and a bridging dose of 200 mg per dose once every 2 weeks (monotherapy trial). Treatment-naive patients were enrolled from a single centre in China to receive six cycles of camrelizumab 200 mg (day 1), gemcitabine 1 g/m<sup>2</sup> (days 1 and 8), and cisplatin 80 mg/m<sup>2</sup> (day 1) every 3 weeks followed by camrelizumab 200 mg maintenance once every 3 weeks (combination trial). The primary endpoint of both trials was the safety and tolerability of the study treatment. Analyses were done per protocol. Both trials are registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT02721589 (camrelizumab monotherapy trial) and NCT03121716 (camrelizumab combination trial). Both trials are ongoing, but are no longer enrolling patients. In the camrelizumab monotherapy trial, between March 31, 2016, and Sept 20, 2017, 121 patients were assessed for eligibility, of whom 93 patients were enrolled across the dose-escalation and expansion cohorts and received at least one dose of camrelizumab (safety population). 15 (16%) of 93 patients had treatment-related adverse events of grade 3 or 4, the most common of which were elevated conjugated bilirubin concentration (three [3%] of 93 patients), stomatitis, anaemia, and increased concentrations of aspartate aminotransferase, alanine aminotransferase, and total bilirubin, each of which occurred in two (2%) patients. Eight (9%) patients had a treatment-related serious adverse event. No dose-limiting toxic effects were observed during the dose-escalation phase. 31 (34%; 95% CI 24-44) of 91 evaluable patients on camrelizumab monotherapy had an overall response with a median follow-up of 9·9 months (IQR 8·1-11·7). In the camrelizumab combination trial, between April 18, 2017, and Aug 15, 2017, 24 patients were assessed for eligibility, of whom 23 patients were enrolled and treated (safety population). 20 (87%) of 23 patients had grade 3 or 4 treatment-related adverse events: neutropenia (13 [57%] of 23 patients), anaemia (11 [48%] patients), leucopenia (11 [48%] patients), thrombocytopenia (seven [30%] patients), oedema (two [9%] patients), hyponatraemia (two [9%] patients), hypochloraemia (one [4%] patients), and rash (one [4%] patient). Two patients had treatment-related serious adverse events. No treatment-related deaths occurred in these trials. 20 (91% [95% CI 72-97]) of 22 evaluable patients had an overall response with a median follow-up time of 10·2 months (IQR 9·7-10·8). Camrelizumab is a well tolerated, potential treatment option for patients with recurrent or metastatic nasopharyngeal carcinoma. The combination of camrelizumab plus gemcitabine and cisplatin has a manageable toxicity profile and promising preliminary antitumour activity for this disease in treatment-naive patients. Randomised controlled trials are needed to further establish the role of immune checkpoint inhibition for nasopharyngeal carcinomas.

Blocking the interaction between PD-1 and its ligands is a promising treatment strategy for advanced hepatocellular carcinoma. This study aimed to assess the antitumour activity and safety of the anti-PD-1 inhibitor camrelizumab in pretreated patients with advanced hepatocellular carcinoma. This is a multicentre, open-label, parallel-group, randomised, phase 2 trial done at 13 study sites in China. Eligible patients were aged 18 years and older with a histological or cytological diagnosis of advanced hepatocellular carcinoma, had progressed on or were intolerant to previous systemic treatment, and had an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance score of 0-1. Patients were randomly assigned (1:1) to receive camrelizumab 3 mg/kg intravenously every 2 or 3 weeks, via a centralised interactive web-response system using block randomisation (block size of four). The primary endpoints were objective response (per blinded independent central review) and 6-month overall survival, in all randomly assigned patients who had at least one dose of study treatment. Safety was analysed in all treated patients. This study is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT02989922, and follow-up is ongoing, but enrolment is closed. Between Nov 15, 2016, and Nov 16, 2017, 303 patients were screened for eligibility, of whom 220 eligible patients were randomly assigned and among whom 217 received camrelizumab (109 patients were given treatment every 2 weeks and 108 every 3 weeks). Median follow-up was 12·5 months (IQR 5·7-15·5). Objective response was reported in 32 (14·7%; 95% CI 10·3-20·2) of 217 patients. The overall survival probability at 6 months was 74·4% (95% CI 68·0-79·7)]. Grade 3 or 4 treatment-related adverse events occurred in 47 (22%) of 217 patients; the most common were increased aspartate aminotransferase (ten [5%]) and decreased neutrophil count (seven [3%]). Two deaths were judged by the investigators to be potentially treatment-related (one due to liver dysfunction and one due to multiple organ failure). Camrelizumab showed antitumour activity in pretreated Chinese patients with advanced hepatocellular carcinoma, with manageable toxicities, and might represent a new treatment option for these patients.

Patients with advanced or metastatic oesophageal squamous cell carcinoma have poor prognosis and few treatment options after first-line therapy. We aimed to assess efficacy and safety of the anti-PD-1 antibody camrelizumab versus investigator's choice of chemotherapy in previously treated patients. ESCORT is a randomised, open-label, phase 3 study of patients aged 18 to 75 years with a histological or cytological diagnosis of advanced or metastatic oesophageal squamous cell carcinoma done at 43 hospitals in China. Eligible patients had an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status of 0 or 1, and had progressed on, or were intolerant to, first-line standard therapy. Patients were randomly assigned (1:1) to camrelizumab (200 mg every 2 weeks) or chemotherapy with docetaxel (75 mg/m<sup>2</sup> every 3 weeks) or irinotecan (180 mg/m<sup>2</sup> every 2 weeks), all given intravenously. Central randomisation was done using the Randomization and Trial Supply Management system with block size randomly generated as four or six and stratified by disease and ECOG performance status. The primary endpoint was overall survival, assessed in randomised patients who had received at least one dose of treatment. Safety was assessed in all treated patients. The trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT03099382, and is closed to new participants. From May 10, 2017, to July 24, 2018, 457 (75%) of 607 screened patients were randomly assigned to treatment, of whom 228 received camrelizumab treatment and 220 received chemotherapy. As of data cutoff on May 6, 2019, with a median follow-up time of 8·3 months (IQR 4·1-12·8) in the camrelizumab group and 6·2 months (3·6-10·1) in the chemotherapy group, median overall survival was 8·3 months (95% CI 6·8-9·7) in the camrelizumab group and 6·2 months (5·7-6·9) in the chemotherapy group (hazard ratio 0·71 [95% CI 0·57-0·87]; two-sided p=0·0010). The most common treatment-related adverse events of grade 3 or worse were anaemia (camrelizumab vs chemotherapy: six [3%] vs 11 [5%]), abnormal hepatic function (four [2%] vs one [<1%]), and diarrhoea (three [1%] vs nine [4%]). Serious treatment-related adverse events occurred in 37 (16%) of 228 patients in the camrelizumab group, and in 32 (15%) of 220 patients in the chemotherapy group. Ten treatment-related deaths occurred, seven (3%) in the camrelizumab group (three deaths from unknown causes, one enterocolitis, one hepatic function abnormal, one pneumonitis, and one myocarditis) and three (1%) in the chemotherapy group (two deaths from unknown causes, and one gastrointestinal haemorrhage). Second-line camrelizumab significantly improved overall survival in patients with advanced or metastatic oesophageal squamous cell carcinoma compared with chemotherapy, with a manageable safety profile. It might represent a potential option of standard second-line treatment for patients with oesophageal squamous cell carcinoma in China. Jiangsu Hengrui Medicine.

Patients with relapsed/refractory primary mediastinal B-cell lymphoma (rrPMBCL) represent a particularly challenging population to treat, with few life-saving treatment options in the context of a dismal prognosis. In this open-label, single-arm, phase II study, the safety and efficacy of combined regimen of chemotherapy consisting of gemcitabine, vinorelbine, and pegylated liposomal doxorubicin (GVD) plus anti-PD-1 antibody camrelizumab was assessed in rrPMBCL. Patients received chemo-immunotherapy every 3 weeks until the second confirmed complete response (CR) or up to 12 cycles, followed by camrelizumab monotherapy for up to 1 year. The primary endpoints were objective response rate (ORR) and safety. Twenty-seven response evaluable patients were enrolled, who received a median of three first-line therapies, 59% with bulky disease. The ORR was 74%, including 56% with a CR. A median time of 1.7 months to response was observed, with 78% exhibiting tumor shrinkage at the first evaluation. After 24.8 months median follow-up, the median duration of response was not reached, with a 65% 2-year estimated response rate. Thirteen responders remained in sustained complete remission. Estimated 24-month progression-free survival and overall survival rates were 48.2% and 81.5%, respectively. Any grade and grade 3 treatment-related adverse events (AE) occurred in 93% and 33% of patients, respectively; with no grade 4 or 5 AEs. Baseline levels of IL10, IFNγ, and soluble Fas were associated with objective response. Camrelizumab plus GVD chemotherapy offers a potent option as life-saving chemo-immunotherapy with promising efficacy and a manageable safety profile for patients with rrPMBCL, especially with bulky aggressive disease.

A small proportion of patients with advanced esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC) could benefit from immune checkpoint inhibitors; however, reliable peripheral blood biomarkers for outcomes of anti-PD-1 immunotherapy in ESCC have not been identified. The data of 43 patients in the ESCC cohort of a phase I trial at our center were retrospectively reviewed. All patients were administered intravenous camrelizumab (SHR-1210), a novel anti-PD-1 antibody, at doses of 60 mg, 200 mg, or 400 mg (4-week interval after first dose followed by a 2-week schedule) until disease progression or intolerable toxicity. Associations between lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) and other peripheral blood biomarkers at baseline and the efficacy of camrelizumab were also investigated. After median follow-up of 19.6 months, the overall response rate was 25.6% (11/43), including one complete response. Median progression-free and overall survival rates were 2.0 and 8.0 months, respectively. Patients with an elevated baseline LDH had lower tumor response rates (P = 0.02) and shorter progression-free (P = 0.002) and overall (P < 0.0001) survival than patients with normal LDH levels. An increase in LDH levels during treatment was significantly associated with disease progression. Multivariate Cox analysis identified LDH (hazard ratio [HR] 0.18), CRP (HR 0.27), the number of organs involved (HR 0.31), absolute monocyte count (HR 0.33), and Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status (HR 0.36) as independent prognostic factors. Serum LDH, which is readily available in routine clinical practice, is a potential marker for response and a powerful independent factor for survival in advanced ESCC patients treated with anti-PD-1 therapy.

Results of our previous study showed high objective response but short-term activity of apatinib in advanced osteosarcoma. We aimed to investigate the activity of apatinib in combination with camrelizumab in patients with inoperable high-grade osteosarcoma progressing after chemotherapy. This open-label, phase 2 trial was conducted at Peking University People's Hospital. We enrolled patients with advanced osteosarcoma progressed after chemotherapy. Patients received 500 mg apatinib orally once daily plus 200 mg camrelizumab by intravenous infusion every 2 weeks until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. The primary endpoint was progression-free survival (PFS) and clinical benefit rate at 6 months, which were based on RECIST V.1.1. 43 patients were enrolled between January 25 and September 4, 2018. With median follow-up time of 48.3 (Q1, Q3, 30.6, 66.6) weeks, 13 (30.23%, 95% CI 17.2%, 40.1%) of 43 patients were progression free at 6 months and the 6-month PFS rate was 50.9% (95% CI 34.6%, 65.0%). Until final follow-up, the objective response rate was 20.9% (9/43) and two patients with durable disease control were observed. Patients with programmed cell death 1 ligand-1 (PD-L1) tumor proportion score ≥5% and pulmonary metastases tended to have a longer PFS in comparison to the others (p=0.004 and 0.017, respectively). Toxic effects led to dose reductions, or interruptions, or both in 24 (55.8%) of 43 patients and permanent discontinuation in 4 (9.3%) patients. There were no treatment-related deaths. Although the combination of apatinib and camrelizumab seemed to prolong PFS in comparison to single agent apatinib in treating advanced osteosarcoma, it did not reach the prespecified target of 6-month PFS of 60% or greater. Overexpression of PD-L1 and the presence of pulmonary metastases only were associated with longer PFS. NCT03359018.

Camrelizumab is a programmed death receptor-1 inhibitor originally developed in China for the treatment of refractory lymphoma. It has also been effective in non-small-cell lung cancer patients. However, the rechallenge of camrelizumab was not reported previously. We report the rechallenge of camrelizumab therapy in two patients previously treated with microwave ablation (MWA) and camrelizumab. Although objective responses were achieved, camrelizumab therapy was discontinued because of the development of immune-related pneumonia (IRP). Treatment with camrelizumab was reinitiated after the patients recovered from IRP. The reoccurrence of more severe IRP necessitated additional corticosteroid therapy. The rechallenge of camrelizumab in patients treated with MWA plus camrelizumab regimen and who developed IRP should be cautious.

Camrelizumab inhibits PD-1 in non-clinical models and showed typical non-clinical pharmacokinetic (PK) and safety profiles for an IgG4 monoclonal antibody. We report results from the First-in-Human Phase 1 trial of camrelizumab in Australian population. Camrelizumab was administered to patients with advanced solid tumors who had failed standard therapies. In the dose-escalation phase (n=23), camrelizumab was administered intravenously at 1 mg/kg, 3 mg/kg, 6 mg/kg, and 10 mg/kg every 2 weeks. In dose expansion (n=26), camrelizumab was given at 200 mg or 600 mg every 4 weeks. Two dose-limiting toxicities were observed during dose escalation: transaminase elevation and diarrhea (both grade 3). Overall, treatment-related adverse events were consistent with the expected toxicity profile of immune checkpoint inhibition, with the striking exception of the dose-related development of angiomatous skin lesions characterized as reactive cutaneous capillary endothelial proliferation. The PK profile showed a dose-progressive increase in half-life from 3 days at 1 mg/kg to 7 days at 10 mg/kg. Moreover, receptor occupancy assays showed a PD-1 occupancy of >50% in most patients out to 28 days post-dose. The objective response rate was 15.2% (95% CI 6.3-28.9). Camrelizumab has manageable toxicity and encouraging preliminary antitumor activity in advanced solid tumors in Australia. ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT02492789.

Patients with DNA mismatch repair-deficient (dMMR)/microsatellite instability-high (MSI-H) cancers are prone to response to programmed cell death-1 (PD-1) checkpoint inhibitors. Therefore, we explored the efficacy and safety of a PD-1 checkpoint inhibitor camrelizumab in advanced or metastatic solid tumour with dMMR/MSI-H. Patients with dMMR/MSI-H advanced or metastatic solid tumours who had received at least one line of prior systemic chemotherapy were recruited. Camrelizumab was given intravenously 200 mg every 2-week treatment cycle. The primary endpoint was objective response rate according to Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumours v1.1. Twelve patients were enrolled. As data cutoff, eight patients (66.7%, 95% CI 34.9-90.1) achieved objective response. Disease control rate reached 100% (95% CI 73.5-100). Progression-free survival rate at 12 months was 83.3% (95% CI 48.2-95.6), and overall survival rate at 12 months was 90% (95% CI 47.3-98.5). The most common treatment-related adverse events were reactive cutaneous capillary endothelial proliferation (100%), increased alanine aminotransferase (41.7%), and increased aspartate aminotransferase (41.7%). Camrelizumab provided durable objective response and disease control in pre-treated patients with dMMR/MSI-H advanced or metastatic solid tumour, being a promising treatment option for these patients.

Anti-programmed cell death 1(anti-PD-1) antibodies are immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) used as a treatment option for a number of cancers to expand lifespan. However, the toxicity caused by ICIs is often unpredictable and can be occasionally life-threatening. To evaluate the immune-related adverse events (irAEs) induced by Camrelizumab, an anti-PD-1 antibody in a patient with gastric cancer. The patient was a 32-year-old man who was diagnosed with stage IIIA gastric adenocarcinoma (cT4aN1M0) in pre-operative evaluation. However, pancreatic invasion and peritoneal metastasis were found during surgery. He received a three-week cycle of 200 mg Camrelizumab combined with systemic chemotherapy. After the fifth administration of Camrelizumab, the patient displayed irAE mimicking Behcet's disease with oral and penile ulcers, skin and abdominal incision lesions. Camrelizumab was permanently discontinued, but systemic chemotherapy was continued. The symptoms were improved with discontinuation of Camrelizumab and administration of glucocorticoid and immunosuppressive agents for 8 weeks, but suspicious liver metastases occurred and carbohydrate antigen 19-9 showed an increasing trend in the meantime. Given the significant improvement in the patient's symptoms after discontinuation of Camrelizumab and administration of corticosteroids and immunosuppressants, we assumed that these treatments may play a role in the rehabilitation of patients. Severe irAEs occur at a low frequency when anti-PD-1 antibodies are used as monotherapy. Whether anti-PD-1 antibodies combined with systemic chemotherapy increase the incidence of irAEs is not certain.

<b>Background:</b> Radiation recall pneumonitis (RRP) is an unpredictable but relatively severe subclinical radiation damage which occurs in the previously irradiated fields of pulmonary tissue after administration of a systemic agent. Previous reports of RRP were mainly attributed to chemotherapy and molecular-target agents. RRP induced by immunotherapy has been rarely reported. Here we describe a case of a novel pattern of RRP induced by anti-PD-1 blockade Camrelizumab 2 years after radiotherapy, with some focus on further understanding of this phenomenon. <b>Case Report:</b> A 64-year-old man with non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) received two cycles of chemotherapy with cisplatin and pemetrexed first. Subsequently, he underwent concomitant chemoradiotherapy with cisplatin and pemetrexed to simultaneous integrated boost (SIB) radiotherapy. After 15 months, due to tumor progression and brain metastasis, he started with administration of anti-PD-1 blockade Camrelizumab (200 mg q2w) and stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS). The patient developed fever, dyspnea and cough after the eighth administration of Camrelizumab. Meanwhile, his chest CT revealed patchy consolidation and ground-glass opacities localized within the previously irradiated area. Subsequent treatment regimen was adjusted to 80 mg q12h prednisolone with discontinuation of Camrelizumab. Then the symptoms gradually eased and reexamination of CT showed significant improvement in RRP after 2 weeks. <b>Conclusion:</b> Our case report presents a novel pattern of RRP induced by anti-PD-1 blockade Camrelizumab 2 years after radiotherapy. This indicates that previous radiotherapy combined with subsequent anti-PD-1 blockade has a potential to cause overlapping damage to lung, suggesting that intensive attention might be needed for patients who are treated with anti-PD-1 blockade in conjunction with a prior history of thoracic radiation.

We assessed the efficacy and safety of camrelizumab [an anti-programmed death (PD-1) mAb] plus apatinib (a VEGFR-2 tyrosine kinase inhibitor) in patients with advanced hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). This nonrandomized, open-label, multicenter, phase II study enrolled patients with advanced HCC who were treatment-naïve or refractory/intolerant to first-line targeted therapy. Patients received intravenous camrelizumab 200 mg (for bodyweight ≥50 kg) or 3 mg/kg (for bodyweight <50 kg) every 2 weeks plus oral apatinib 250 mg daily. The primary endpoint was objective response rate (ORR) assessed by an independent review committee (IRC) per RECIST v1.1. Seventy patients in the first-line setting and 120 patients in the second-line setting were enrolled. As of January 10, 2020, the ORR was 34.3% [24/70; 95% confidence interval (CI), 23.3-46.6] in the first-line and 22.5% (27/120; 95% CI, 15.4-31.0) in the second-line cohort per IRC. Median progression-free survival in both cohorts was 5.7 months (95% CI, 5.4-7.4) and 5.5 months (95% CI, 3.7-5.6), respectively. The 12-month survival rate was 74.7% (95% CI, 62.5-83.5) and 68.2% (95% CI, 59.0-75.7), respectively. Grade ≥3 treatment-related adverse events (TRAE) were reported in 147 (77.4%) of 190 patients, with the most common being hypertension (34.2%). Serious TRAEs occurred in 55 (28.9%) patients. Two (1.1%) treatment-related deaths occurred. Camrelizumab combined with apatinib showed promising efficacy and manageable safety in patients with advanced HCC in both the first-line and second-line setting. It might represent a novel treatment option for these patients.<i>See related commentary by Pinato et al., p. 908</i>.

Camrelizumab (also known as SHR-1210), a humanized monoclonal antibody against PD-1, has been shown to block the binding of PD-1 to PD-L1 and consequently inhibit the immune escape of tumor cells. Recently, camrelizumab was approved as a second-line drug for previously treated advanced hepatocellular carcinoma in China. In this paper, the chemical properties, mechanism of action, pharmacokinetics, clinical efficacy, safety, and tolerability of camrelizumab for the treatment of advanced hepatocellular carcinoma are introduced in detail. The strategy for combination therapy and the potential application of camrelizumab in other solid tumors are briefly described. We performed a systematic review of the literature in PubMed and the following keywords were used: 'SHR-1210,' 'Camrelizumab,' and 'hepatocellular carcinoma.' Camrelizumab is a selective, humanized, high-affinity IgG4 kappa mAb against PD-1. Camrelizumab showed promising antitumor activity and manageable toxicities and offers a new second-line drug option for patients with advanced hepatocellular carcinoma. Reactive cutaneous capillary endothelial proliferation is a novel but prevalent immune-related dermatologic toxicity of camrelizumab, which is mild, reversible, and predictable. More clinical trials of camrelizumab are ongoing to develop combination therapy strategies and new indications for malignancies.

For classical Hodgkin lymphoma (cHL), programmed death-l (PD-1) is a well-recognized attractive target. This multicenter, single-arm, phase II study evaluated the efficacy and safety of camrelizumab, a humanized high-affinity IgG4 mAb against PD-1, in Chinese patients with relapsed or refractory cHL. Patients who had failed to achieve a remission or experienced progression after autologous stem cell transplantation or had received at least two lines of systemic chemotherapies were given camrelizumab 200 mg every 2 weeks. The primary endpoint was objective response rate per independent review committee (IRC) assessment. This study is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov (NCT03155425). Between June 9, 2017 and September 18, 2017, 75 patients were enrolled and treated. At a median follow-up of 12.9 months, 57 of 75 (76.0%; 95% CI, 64.7-85.1) patients achieved an IRC-assessed objective response, including 21 (28.0%) and 36 (48.0%) patients who had complete and partial remission, respectively. Median duration of response was not reached (range, 0.0<sup>+</sup>-12.8<sup>+</sup> months). Treatment-related adverse events (AE) occurred in all patients. The most common ones included cutaneous reactive capillary endothelial proliferation (97.3%, 73/75) and pyrexia (42.7%, 32/75). Grade 3 or 4 treatment-related AEs occurred in 20 patients (26.7%); the most common AE was decreased white blood cell count (4.0%, 3/75). There were no grade 5 treatment-related AEs. Camrelizumab demonstrated a high response rate, durable response and controllable safety in Chinese patients with relapsed or refractory cHL, becoming a new safe and effective treatment option in this setting.

Camrelizumab, a programmed cell death 1 (PD-1) inhibitor, has been approved for the treatment of patients with relapsed or refractory classical Hodgkin lymphoma, nasopharyngeal cancer and non-small cell lung cancer. The aim of this study was to perform a population pharmacokinetic (PK) analysis of camrelizumab to quantify the impact of patient characteristics and to investigate the appropriateness of a flat dose in the dosing regimen. A total of 3092 camrelizumab concentrations from 133 patients in four clinical trials with advanced melanoma, relapsed or refractory classical Hodgkin lymphoma and other solid tumor types were analyzed using nonlinear mixed effects modeling. The PKs of camrelizumab were properly described using a two-compartment model with parallel linear and nonlinear clearance. Then, covariate model building was conducted using stepwise forward addition and backward elimination. The results showed that baseline albumin had significant effects on linear clearance, while actual body weight affected intercompartmental clearance. However, their impacts were limited, and no dose adjustments were required. The final model was further evaluated by goodness-of-fit plots, bootstrap procedures, and visual predictive checks and showed satisfactory model performance. Moreover, dosing regimens of 200 mg every 2 weeks and 3 mg/kg every 2 weeks provided similar exposure distributions by model-based Monte Carlo simulation. The population analyses demonstrated that patient characteristics have no clinically meaningful impact on the PKs of camrelizumab and present evidence for no advantage of either the flat dose or weight-based dose regimen for most patients with advanced solid tumors.

Recent phase 1-2 trials reported manageable safety profiles and promising antitumor activities of anti-PD-1 drugs (pembrolizumab, nivolumab, camrelizumab and JS001) with/without chemotherapy in recurrent/metastatic nasopharyngeal carcinoma (RM-NPC), however head-to-head comparison among these regimens is lacking. We aimed to comprehensively compare the efficacy and safety of different anti-PD-1 drugs, standard chemotherapy, and their combination therapy in RM-NPC. Adverse event (AE) and objective response rate (ORR) were assessed. The pooled incidence rates of grade 1-5/3-5 AEs were 74.1%/29.6, 54.2%/17.4, 92.3%/24.5, 96.8%/16.1, 91.2%/42.8, and 100%/87.9% for pembrolizumab, nivolumab, JS001, camrelizumab, chemotherapy and camrelizumab+chemotherapy, respectively, which suggested that nivolumab and pembrolizumab exhibited the optimal safety regarding grade 1-5 AEs whereas camrelizumab and nivolumab regarding grade 3-5 AEs. As second- or later-line therapy, ORR was higher with camrelizumab (34.1%), followed by pembrolizumab (26.3%), JS001 (23.3%), and nivolumab (19.0%); whereas ORR with first-line nivolumab reached 40%. Additionally, first-line camrelizumab+chemotherapy achieved a dramatically higher ORR than that with chemotherapy alone (90.9% vs. 64.1%). Pooled ORR was 28.4 and 17.4% for PD-L1-positive and PD-L1-negative patients, respectively (P = 0.11). Here, we represent preliminary evidence for the comparative safety and efficacy of existing anti-PD-1 agents with/without chemotherapy in RM-NPC, which indicated that camrelizumab has the least toxicity profile and merits future investigation. Our findings might provide insights into the future design of immunotherapy trials in RM-NPC.

We report a case of a 68-year-old man diagnosed with pulmonary pleomorphic carcinoma who showed partial response after a single treatment with camrelizumab (PD1 monoclonal antibody). The patient's tumor was positive for programmed cell death ligand 1 (PD-L1) and progressed rapidly after a course of chemotherapy. Fortunately, the tumors dramatically shrank after one cycle of camrelizumab, an anti-programmed cell death-1 (PD-1) antibody developed by Chinese Hengrui Medicine. In conclusion, camrelizumab may be a good treatment option, especially in tumors that express PD-L1.

Camrelizumab (AiRuiKa™), a programmed cell death 1 (PD-1) inhibitor being developed by Jiangsu Hengrui Medicine Co. Ltd, recently received conditional approval in China for the treatment of relapsed or refractory classical Hodgkin lymphoma. The drug is also being investigated as a treatment for various other malignancies, including B cell lymphoma, oesophageal squamous cell carcinoma, gastric/gastroesophageal junction cancer, hepatocellular carcinoma, nasopharyngeal cancer and non-squamous, non-small cell lung cancer. This article summarizes the milestones in the development of camrelizumab leading to this first approval for classical Hodgkin lymphoma.

Anti-programmed death-1 (PD-1) monotherapy induces a high response rate in patients with relapsed/refractory classic Hodgkin lymphoma (cHL), but complete remission (CR) is infrequently observed. As decitabine is known to boost T-cell function, we assessed the safety and efficacy of anti-PD-1 camrelizumab alone versus decitabine-primed camrelizumab in patients with relapsed/refractory cHL. This two-arm, open-label, phase II study enrolled patients with relapsed/refractory cHL who had received at least two lines of previous therapy. Anti-PD-1 treatment-naïve patients were randomly assigned (1:2) to camrelizumab (200 mg) monotherapy or decitabine (10 mg/d, days 1 to 5) plus camrelizumab (200 mg, day 8) combination therapy every 3 weeks. Patients who were previously treated with anti-PD-1 were assigned combination therapy. Primary end point was CR rate and safety. Overall, 86 patients were enrolled and evaluated for response, with a median follow-up of 14.9 months. In anti-PD-1-naïve patients, CR rate was 32% (six of 19 patients) with camrelizumab monotherapy versus 71% (30 of 42 patients) who were administered decitabine plus camrelizumab (<i>P</i> = .003). At the time of analysis, the response duration rate at 6 months was 76% on camrelizumab monotherapy versus 100% on decitabine plus camrelizumab. For patients who were previously treated with anti-PD-1, 28% achieved CR and 24% partial response after decitabine plus camrelizumab. Ten patients maintained a response at more than 6 months and 81% of responders were estimated to have a response at more than 1 year. For both treatments, the most common adverse events were clinically inconsequential cherry hemangiomas and leukocytopenia that were self-limiting. CR rate in patients with relapsed/refractory cHL who were clinically naïve to PD-1 blockade was significantly higher with decitabine plus camrelizumab than with camrelizumab alone. Decitabine plus camrelizumab may reverse resistance to PD-1 inhibitors in patients with relapsed/refractory cHL.

Pulmonary sarcomatoid carcinoma (PSC) is characterized by dismal prognosis and resistance to platinum-based chemotherapy. The immune checkpoint inhibitors showed promising efficacy in the treatment of PSC. Camrelizumab is a programmed cell death protein 1 inhibitor; however, current evidence of its efficacy in PSC is lacking. A 47-year-old female non-smoker presented with central-type masses in the right upper and lower lobes. PSC (cT4N2M0, stage IIIB) with positive expression of programmed death ligand-1 was diagnosed. First-line camrelizumab plus doxorubicin and cisplatin was introduced, followed by camrelizumab monotherapy due to grade 4 leukopenia and thrombocytopenia during the combination therapy. The lesions indicated a partial remission which endured for more than 20 months. Camrelizumab plus doxorubicin and cisplatin regimen is a promising option for PSC patients. Further high-quality trials are warranted.

The current evidence regarding immunotherapy plus targeted therapy in esophageal neuroendocrine carcinoma (NEC) is lacking. Camrelizumab is a programmed cell death protein 1 inhibitor. Apatinib is a selective tyrosine kinase inhibitor of vascular endothelial growth factor receptor-2. A 50-year-old female was initially diagnosed as primary esophageal NEC. Neoadjuvant chemotherapy and Ivor Lewis esophagectomy were performed (ypT3N0M0, stage Ⅱ). Twenty months after the surgery, an isolated mediastinal lymph node recurrence of NEC was recorded. The specimen revealed a positive expression of vascular endothelial growth factor and programmed cell death ligand 1. The diseased lymph node was slightly enlarged after two cycles of first-line paclitaxel liposome and S-1. Second-line apatinib and S-1 for 2 months also resulted in progressive disease. Subsequently, third-line camrelizumab plus apatinib was continued for 5 months. The patient demonstrated a progression-free status for more than 10 months following the combination therapy. Meanwhile, relevant studies of camrelizumab in gastric or esophageal cancer were briefly reviewed. Based on the current evidence, camrelizumab is a promising agent for esophageal cancer. More prospective trials are warranted before a definite recommendation could be drawn.

The clinical significance of programmed cell death protein-1 (PD-1)-targeted immunotherapy in Chinese patients is understudied. We thus aimed to evaluate the safety and efficacy of PD-1 inhibitors with toripalimab, camrelizumab or sintilimab for Chinese hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) patients in a real-life cohort. We analysed hepatitis B virus (HBV)-associated HCC patients treated with toripalimab, camrelizumab, or sintilimab in a retrospective single-center cohort from November 2018 to June 2020. Efficacy was evaluated with objective response rate (ORR), disease control rate (DCR), progression-free survival (PFS), time to tumor progression (TTP), and overall survival (OS). Safety data were also recorded. Seventy patients were finally included in the analysis: 23 were treated with toripalimab, 33 with camrelizumab, and 14 with sintilimab. The mean duration of follow-up was 44.7 (95% CI: 39.9-49.6) weeks and the mean cycles of PD-1 at cutoff were 8.3±8.0 for all patients. The ORR and DCR for the whole cohort were 30% and 72.9%, respectively. Overall, 25 (35.7%) patients had radiological disease progression and 10 (14.3%) patients died during follow-up. Median PFS, median TTP, and median OS had not yet been reached. Most frequent drug-related adverse events (AEs) were rash (27.1%), hypertension (18.6%), fatigue (17.1%), diarrhea (17.1%), paresthesia (15.7%), and nausea (15.7%). Our findings suggest that (I) PD-1 targeted immunotherapy with toripalimab, camrelizumab, or sintilimab yielded a promising outcome in Chinese HBV patients with HCC and that (II) immunotherapy was well tolerated generally and had manageable side effects. This approach thus warrants further popularization and application in clinical practice.

Immune checkpoint inhibitors can enhance the antitumor activity of the immune system by mainly promoting CD8<sup>+</sup> T lymphocyte immune function. However, they can also induce immune-related adverse events, especially skin toxicity. Some studies found that patients with autoimmune or inflammatory disease are susceptible to immune checkpoint inhibitors and were associated with a significantly increased risk of immune-related adverse events. In our present report, we described a newly diagnosed non-small-cell lung cancer patient who suffered from focal vitiligo for approximately ten years and was treated with the anti-programmed cell death-1 receptor antibody camrelizumab (SHR-1210), which accelerated the aggravation of depigmentation of the skin over the whole body in just half a year.

Immune checkpoint blockade with monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) that target programmed cell death protein-1 (PD-1) has remarkably revolutionized cancer therapy. Their binding kinetics measured by surface plasmon resonance does not always correlate well with their immunotherapeutic efficacies, mainly due to the lack of two-dimensional cell plasma membrane and the capability of force sensing and manipulation. In this regard, based on a more suitable and ultra-sensitive biomechanical nanotool, biomembrane force probe (BFP), we developed a Double-edge Smart Feedback control system as an ultra-stable platform to characterize ultra-long bond lifetimes of receptor-ligand binding on living cells. We further benchmarked the dissociation kinetics for three clinically approved PD-1 blockade mAbs (Nivolumab, Pembrolizumab, and Camrelizumab), intriguingly correlating well with the objective response rates in the hepatocellular carcinoma second-line treatment. This ultra-stable BFP potentially provides a compelling kinetic platform to direct the screening, optimization, and clinical selection of therapeutic antibodies in the future.

PD-1 is a highly glycosylated inhibitory receptor expressed mainly on T cells. Targeting of PD-1 with monoclonal antibodies (MAbs) to block the interaction with its ligand PD-L1 has been successful for the treatment of multiple tumors. However, polymorphisms at N-glycosylation sites of PD-1 exist in the human population that might affect antibody binding, and dysregulated glycosylation has been observed in the tumor microenvironment. Here, we demonstrate varied N-glycan composition in PD-1, and show that the binding affinity of camrelizumab, a recently approved PD-1-specific MAb, to non-glycosylated PD-1 proteins from E. coli is substantially decreased compared with glycosylated PD-1. The structure of the camrelizumab/PD-1 complex reveals that camrelizumab mainly utilizes its heavy chain to bind to PD-1, while the light chain sterically inhibits the binding of PD-L1 to PD-1. Glycosylation of asparagine 58 (N58) promotes the interaction with camrelizumab, while the efficiency of camrelizumab to inhibit the binding of PD-L1 is substantially reduced for glycosylation-deficient PD-1. These results increase our understanding of how glycosylation affects the activity of PD-1-specific MAbs during immune checkpoint therapy.

<b>Background:</b> Although the programmed death 1 (PD-1)/programmed death-ligand 1 (PD-L1) inhibitors have markedly changed the strategies of cancer treatment, most patients with advanced non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) do not respond to PD-1/PD-L1 monotherapy. Epigenetic drugs have been hypothesized to possess the potential to sensitize PD-1/PD-L1 inhibitors. <b>Case Presentation:</b> Three patients with advanced metastatic NSCLC failed to respond to first-line systemic therapy and had a low tumor mutation burden, low tumor neoantigen burden, low microsatellite instability, and HLA loss of heterozygosity according to their target lesion biopsies, all of which were considered unfavorable factors for PD-1/PD-L1 blockage. However, all three patients responded to low-dose decitabine, an epigenetic drug, in combination with camrelizumab (anti-PD-1 antibody), with only controllable adverse events, indicating that low-dose decitabine can sensitize PD-1/PD-L1 inhibitors. <b>Summary:</b> We report a novel therapy with low-dose decitabine plus camrelizumab for advanced NSCLC on the basis of successful treatment of three patients, emphasizing the potential of epigenetic drugs to regulate PD-1/PD-L1 inhibitors in advanced NSCLC.

Camrelizumab is an antibody against programmed death protein 1. We assessed the activity and safety of camrelizumab plus apatinib, a tyrosine kinase inhibitor of vascular endothelial growth factor receptor-2, in patients with advanced cervical cancer. This multicenter, open-label, single-arm, phase II study enrolled patients with advanced cervical cancer who progressed after at least one line of systemic therapy. Patients received camrelizumab 200 mg every 2 weeks and apatinib 250 mg once per day. The primary end point was objective response rate (ORR) assessed by investigators per RECIST version 1.1. Key secondary end points were progression-free survival (PFS), overall survival (OS), duration of response, and safety. Forty-five patients were enrolled and received treatment. Median age was 51.0 years (range, 33-67 years), and 57.8% of patients had previously received two or more lines of chemotherapy for recurrent or metastatic disease. Ten patients (22.2%) had received bevacizumab. Median follow-up was 11.3 months (range, 1.0-15.5 months). ORR was 55.6% (95% CI, 40.0% to 70.4%), with two complete and 23 partial responses. Median PFS was 8.8 months (95% CI, 5.6 months to not estimable). Median duration of response and median OS were not reached. Treatment-related grade 3 or 4 adverse events (AEs) occurred in 71.1% of patients, and the most common AEs were hypertension (24.4%), anemia (20.0%), and fatigue (15.6%). The most common potential immune-related AEs included grade 1-2 hypothyroidism (22.2%) and reactive cutaneous capillary endothelial proliferation (8.9%). Camrelizumab plus apatinib had promising antitumor activity and manageable toxicities in patients with advanced cervical cancer. Larger randomized controlled trials are warranted to validate our findings.
