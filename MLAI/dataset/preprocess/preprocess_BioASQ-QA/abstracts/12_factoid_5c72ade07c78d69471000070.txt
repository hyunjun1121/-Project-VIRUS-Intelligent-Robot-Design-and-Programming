Anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK) is a validated molecular target in non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC). However, the clinical benefits of ALK inhibitors are almost universally limited by the emergence of drug resistance. We monitored the plasma circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA) using captured-based ultra-deep sequencing analysis of one patient with metastatic ALK-positive NSCLC who had received therapies including first-, second- and third-generation ALK inhibitors. Functional in vitro studies were further undertaken to elucidate the mechanism of resistance. ALK T1151Sins mutation was detected when the patient developed resistance to ceritinib, and undetectable when she responded to lorlatinib. MET amplification was present when the tumor developed resistance to lorlatinib, and reduced when the patient received combination therapy of lorlatinib with crizotinib, which corresponded to clinical radiologic responses. In addition, further functional in vitro studies demonstrated that ALK harboring the T1151Sins mutation, while conferring resistance to ceritinib, was inhibited by lorlatinib. Clinical evidence and in vitro validation revealed the clinical usefulness of captured-base ultra-deep sequencing on longitudinal plasma ctDNA in revealing the underlying resistance mechanism and guiding the precise administration of ALK inhibitors in patients with advanced ALK-positive NSCLC.

<i>ALK</i> rearrangements predict for sensitivity to ALK tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs). However, responses to ALK TKIs are generally short-lived. Serial molecular analysis is an informative strategy for identifying genetic mediators of resistance. Although multiple studies support the clinical benefits of repeat tissue sampling, the clinical utility of longitudinal circulating tumor DNA analysis has not been established in ALK-positive lung cancer. Using a 566-gene hybrid-capture next-generation sequencing (NGS) assay, we performed longitudinal analysis of plasma specimens from 22 ALK-positive patients with acquired resistance to ALK TKIs to track the evolution of resistance during treatment. To determine tissue-plasma concordance, we compared plasma findings to results of repeat biopsies. At progression, we detected an <i>ALK</i> fusion in plasma from 19 (86%) of 22 patients, and identified <i>ALK</i> resistance mutations in plasma specimens from 11 (50%) patients. There was 100% agreement between tissue- and plasma-detected <i>ALK</i> fusions. Among 16 cases where contemporaneous plasma and tissue specimens were available, we observed 100% concordance between <i>ALK</i> mutation calls. <i>ALK</i> mutations emerged and disappeared during treatment with sequential ALK TKIs, suggesting that plasma mutation profiles were dependent on the specific TKI administered. <i>ALK</i> G1202R, the most frequent plasma mutation detected after progression on a second-generation TKI, was consistently suppressed during treatment with lorlatinib. Plasma genotyping by NGS is an effective method for detecting <i>ALK</i> fusions and <i>ALK</i> mutations in patients progressing on ALK TKIs. The correlation between plasma <i>ALK</i> mutations and response to distinct ALK TKIs highlights the potential for plasma analysis to guide selection of ALK-directed therapies.

We describe recent developments in the rapidly evolving field of anaplastic lymphoma kinase-targeting agents. Five targeted drugs are currently available in the clinic via regular approval or named patient programs, including crizotinib, ceritinib, alectinib, brigatinib and lorlatinib. Further drugs are tested in clinical trials. This review summarizes published data, together with drug-specific information on dosing and toxicity. Moreover, we discuss different clinical scenarios and potential treatment options in patients with tumor progression, based on current literature and our own experience. Patients with metastatic, anaplastic lymphoma kinase-rearranged nonsmall cell lung cancer should be managed by interdisciplinary expert teams. New drugs with enhanced brain activity are available, and some patients may benefit from local therapies.

The identification of anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK) rearrangements in 2-5% of non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) patients led to the rapid clinical development of its oral tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI). Crizotinib was the first ALK inhibitor approved and utilised in the treatment of ALK+ NSCLC patients in the second line setting first and subsequently in the first line one. Since then many other ALK inhibitors have been developed (ceritinib, alectinib, brigatinib, lorlatinib,etc) and the treatment paradigm of these patients has considerably drifted. The questions regarding their treatment at progression remains unanswered at the moment. Our review clarifies what it is the state of the art in the treatment of ALK rearranged NSCLC patients, highlights the mechanisms of primary and secondary resistance mutations and suggests a treatment algorithm based on specific primary resistance or acquired mutations. Studies that enrolled ALK+ NSCLC patients with locally advance or metastatic disease receiving treatment with ALK inhibitor, first or second line, were identified using electronic databases (MEDLINE, EMBASE, and Cochrane library). Trials were excluded if they were phase 1, enrolled less than 10 patients. Overall 1942 patients were included in our review. It confirms the role and the efficacy in first line of Alectinib but it highlights also that all the ALK inhibitors could play a crucial role during the patients' journey. Identifying the different mutations and utilising the most active ALK inhibitor depending on the "up-to-date" driven mutation is the way forward in the management of those patients. the review shows the rapid drifting in the management of ALK+ NSCLC patients and the importance of fully understanding and acknowledging the role of the resistance mutation, primary or acquired. We strongly advocate a comprehensive genomic approach in the management of ALK+ NSCLC patients who develop resistance mutations that are still targetable by a different ALK inhibitor.

: Targeted therapy changed the standard of care in ALK-dependent tumors. However, resistance remains a major challenge. Lorlatinib is a third-generation ALK inhibitor that inhibits most ALK mutants resistant to current ALK inhibitors. In this study, we utilize lorlatinib-resistant anaplastic large cell lymphoma (ALCL), non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), and neuroblastoma cell lines <i>in vitro</i> and <i>in vivo</i> to investigate the acquisition of resistance and its underlying mechanisms. ALCL cells acquired compound ALK mutations G1202R/G1269A and C1156F/L1198F <i>in vitro</i> at high drug concentrations. ALCL xenografts selected <i>in vivo</i> showed recurrent N1178H (5/10 mice) and G1269A (4/10 mice) mutations. Interestingly, intracellular localization of NPM/ALKN<sup>1178H</sup> skewed toward the cytoplasm in human cells, possibly mimicking overexpression. RNA sequencing of resistant cells showed significant alteration of PI3K/AKT and RAS/MAPK pathways. Functional validation by small-molecule inhibitors confirmed the involvement of these pathways in resistance to lorlatinib. NSCLC cells exposed <i>in vitro</i> to lorlatinib acquired hyperactivation of EGFR, which was blocked by erlotinib to restore sensitivity to lorlatinib. In neuroblastoma, whole-exome sequencing and proteomic profiling of lorlatinib-resistant cells revealed a truncating NF1 mutation and hyperactivation of EGFR and ErbB4. These data provide an extensive characterization of resistance mechanisms that may arise in different ALK-positive cancers following lorlatinib treatment. SIGNIFICANCE: High-throughput genomic, transcriptomic, and proteomic profiling reveals various mechanisms by which multiple tumor types acquire resistance to the third-generation ALK inhibitor lorlatinib.

Lorlatinib (PF-06463922) is a promising oral anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK) and ROS1 inhibitor currently in Phase III clinical trials for treatment of non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) containing an ALK rearrangement. With therapy-resistant brain metastases a major concern in NSCLC, lorlatinib was designed to have high membrane and blood-brain barrier permeability. We investigated the roles of the multidrug efflux transporters ABCB1 and ABCG2, and the multispecific drug-metabolizing enzyme CYP3A in plasma pharmacokinetics and tissue distribution of lorlatinib using genetically modified mouse strains. In vitro, human ABCB1 and mouse Abcg2 modestly transported lorlatinib. Following oral lorlatinib administration (at 10 mg/kg), brain accumulation of lorlatinib, while relatively high in wild-type mice, was still fourfold increased in Abcb1a/1b<sup>-/-</sup> and Abcb1a/1b;Abcg2<sup>-/-</sup> mice, but not in single Abcg2<sup>-/-</sup> mice. Lorlatinib plasma levels were not altered. Oral coadministration of the ABCB1/ABCG2 inhibitor elacridar increased the brain accumulation of lorlatinib in wild-type mice fourfold, that is, to the same level as in Abcb1a/1b;Abcg2<sup>-/-</sup> mice, without altering plasma exposure. Similar results were obtained for lorlatinib testis accumulation. In Cyp3a<sup>-/-</sup> mice, the plasma exposure of lorlatinib was increased 1.3-fold, but was then twofold reduced upon transgenic overexpression of human CYP3A4 in liver and intestine, whereas relative tissue distribution of lorlatinib remained unaltered. Our data indicate that lorlatinib brain accumulation is substantially limited by P-glycoprotein/ABCB1 in the blood-brain barrier, but this can be effectively reversed by elacridar coadministration. Moreover, oral availability of lorlatinib is markedly restricted by CYP3A4 activity. These insights may be used in optimizing the therapeutic application of lorlatinib.

The Massachusetts General Hospital Radiochemistry Program, in collaboration with Pfizer, has developed unique <sup>11</sup>C and <sup>18</sup>F-labeling strategies to synthesize isotopologs of lorlatinib (PF-06463922) which is undergoing phase III clinical trial investigations for treatment of non-small-cell lung cancers with specific molecular alterations. A major goal in cancer therapeutics is to measure the concentrations of this drug in the brain metastases of patients with lung cancer, and penetration of the blood-brain barrier is important for optimal therapeutic outcomes. Our recent publication in Nature Communications employed radiolabeled lorlatinib and positron emission tomography (PET) studies in preclinical models including nonhuman primates (NHPs) that demonstrated high brain permeability of this compound. Our future work with radiolabeled lorlatinib will include advanced PET evaluations in rodent tumor models and normal NHPs with the goal of clinical translation.

The identification of anaplastic lymphoma kinase (<i>ALK</i>), an oncogenetic driver mutation, in lung cancer has paved the way for a new era in the treatment of non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). Targeting ALK using tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKI) has dramatically improved the prognosis of patients with <i>ALK</i>-rearranged NSCLC. However, most patients relapse on ALK-TKI therapy within a few years because of acquired resistance. One mechanism of acquiring resistance is a second mutation on the <i>ALK</i> gene, and the representative mutation is L1996M in the gatekeeper residue. In particular, the solvent-front <i>ALK</i> G1202R mutation is the common cause of resistance against first- and second-generation ALK-TKIs. Another major concern regarding ALK-TKI is metastasis to the central nervous system, commonly observed in patients relapsing after ALK-TKI therapy. The next-generation ALK inhibitor lorlatinib (PF-06463922) has therefore been developed to inhibit resistant <i>ALK</i> mutations, including <i>ALK</i> G1202R, and to penetrate the blood-brain barrier. In a Phase I/II trial, the safety and efficacy of lorlatinib were demonstrated in patients with advanced <i>ALK</i>-positive NSCLC, most of whom had central nervous system metastases and had previous ALK-TKI treatment. In this review, we discuss the structure, pharmacodynamics, and pharmacokinetics of lorlatinib and compare its characteristics with those of other ALK inhibitors. Furthermore, clinical trials for lorlatinib are summarized, and future perspectives in the management of patients with <i>ALK</i>-rearranged NSCLC are discussed.

Purpose Advanced anaplastic lymphoma kinase ( ALK) fusion-positive non-small-cell lung cancers (NSCLCs) are effectively treated with ALK tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs). However, clinical outcomes in these patients vary, and the benefit of TKIs is limited as a result of acquired resistance. Emerging data suggest that the ALK fusion variant may affect clinical outcome, but the molecular basis for this association is unknown. Patients and Methods We identified 129 patients with ALK-positive NSCLC with known ALK variants. ALK resistance mutations and clinical outcomes on ALK TKIs were retrospectively evaluated according to ALK variant. A Foundation Medicine data set of 577 patients with ALK-positive NSCLC was also examined. Results The most frequent ALK variants were EML4-ALK variant 1 in 55 patients (43%) and variant 3 in 51 patients (40%). We analyzed 77 tumor biopsy specimens from patients with variants 1 and 3 who had progressed on an ALK TKI. ALK resistance mutations were significantly more common in variant 3 than in variant 1 (57% v 30%; P = .023). In particular, ALK G1202R was more common in variant 3 than in variant 1 (32% v 0%; P < .001). Analysis of the Foundation Medicine database revealed similar associations of variant 3 with ALK resistance mutation and with G1202R ( P = .010 and .015, respectively). Among patients treated with the third-generation ALK TKI lorlatinib, variant 3 was associated with a significantly longer progression-free survival than variant 1 (hazard ratio, 0.31; 95% CI, 0.12 to 0.79; P = .011). Conclusion Specific ALK variants may be associated with the development of ALK resistance mutations, particularly G1202R, and provide a molecular link between variant and clinical outcome. ALK variant thus represents a potentially important factor in the selection of next-generation ALK inhibitors.

Lorlatinib (PF-06463922) is a next-generation small-molecule inhibitor of the orphan receptor tyrosine kinase c-ros oncogene 1 (ROS1), which has a kinase domain that is physiologically related to anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK), and is undergoing Phase I/II clinical trial investigations for non-small cell lung cancers. An early goal is to measure the concentrations of this drug in brain tumour lesions of lung cancer patients, as penetration of the blood-brain barrier is important for optimal therapeutic outcomes. Here we prepare both <sup>11</sup>C- and <sup>18</sup>F-isotopologues of lorlatinib to determine the biodistribution and whole-body dosimetry assessments by positron emission tomography (PET). Non-traditional radiolabelling strategies are employed to enable an automated multistep <sup>11</sup>C-labelling process and an iodonium ylide-based radiofluorination. Carbon-11-labelled lorlatinib is routinely prepared with good radiochemical yields and shows reasonable tumour uptake in rodents. PET imaging in non-human primates confirms that this radiotracer has high brain permeability.

Lorlatinib is a potent, brain-penetrant, third-generation inhibitor of ALK and ROS1 tyrosine kinases with broad coverage of ALK mutations. In a phase 1 study, activity was seen in patients with ALK-positive non-small-cell lung cancer, most of whom had CNS metastases and progression after ALK-directed therapy. We aimed to analyse the overall and intracranial antitumour activity of lorlatinib in patients with ALK-positive, advanced non-small-cell lung cancer. In this phase 2 study, patients with histologically or cytologically ALK-positive or ROS1-positive, advanced, non-small-cell lung cancer, with or without CNS metastases, with an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status of 0, 1, or 2, and adequate end-organ function were eligible. Patients were enrolled into six different expansion cohorts (EXP1-6) on the basis of ALK and ROS1 status and previous therapy, and were given lorlatinib 100 mg orally once daily continuously in 21-day cycles. The primary endpoint was overall and intracranial tumour response by independent central review, assessed in pooled subgroups of ALK-positive patients. Analyses of activity and safety were based on the safety analysis set (ie, all patients who received at least one dose of lorlatinib) as assessed by independent central review. Patients with measurable CNS metastases at baseline by independent central review were included in the intracranial activity analyses. In this report, we present lorlatinib activity data for the ALK-positive patients (EXP1-5 only), and safety data for all treated patients (EXP1-6). This study is ongoing and is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT01970865. Between Sept 15, 2015, and Oct 3, 2016, 276 patients were enrolled: 30 who were ALK positive and treatment naive (EXP1); 59 who were ALK positive and received previous crizotinib without (n=27; EXP2) or with (n=32; EXP3A) previous chemotherapy; 28 who were ALK positive and received one previous non-crizotinib ALK tyrosine kinase inhibitor, with or without chemotherapy (EXP3B); 112 who were ALK positive with two (n=66; EXP4) or three (n=46; EXP5) previous ALK tyrosine kinase inhibitors with or without chemotherapy; and 47 who were ROS1 positive with any previous treatment (EXP6). One patient in EXP4 died before receiving lorlatinib and was excluded from the safety analysis set. In treatment-naive patients (EXP1), an objective response was achieved in 27 (90·0%; 95% CI 73·5-97·9) of 30 patients. Three patients in EXP1 had measurable baseline CNS lesions per independent central review, and objective intracranial responses were observed in two (66·7%; 95% CI 9·4-99·2). In ALK-positive patients with at least one previous ALK tyrosine kinase inhibitor (EXP2-5), objective responses were achieved in 93 (47·0%; 39·9-54·2) of 198 patients and objective intracranial response in those with measurable baseline CNS lesions in 51 (63·0%; 51·5-73·4) of 81 patients. Objective response was achieved in 41 (69·5%; 95% CI 56·1-80·8) of 59 patients who had only received previous crizotinib (EXP2-3A), nine (32·1%; 15·9-52·4) of 28 patients with one previous non-crizotinib ALK tyrosine kinase inhibitor (EXP3B), and 43 (38·7%; 29·6-48·5) of 111 patients with two or more previous ALK tyrosine kinase inhibitors (EXP4-5). Objective intracranial response was achieved in 20 (87·0%; 95% CI 66·4-97·2) of 23 patients with measurable baseline CNS lesions in EXP2-3A, five (55·6%; 21·2-86·3) of nine patients in EXP3B, and 26 (53·1%; 38·3-67·5) of 49 patients in EXP4-5. The most common treatment-related adverse events across all patients were hypercholesterolaemia (224 [81%] of 275 patients overall and 43 [16%] grade 3-4) and hypertriglyceridaemia (166 [60%] overall and 43 [16%] grade 3-4). Serious treatment-related adverse events occurred in 19 (7%) of 275 patients and seven patients (3%) permanently discontinued treatment because of treatment-related adverse events. No treatment-related deaths were reported. Consistent with its broad ALK mutational coverage and CNS penetration, lorlatinib showed substantial overall and intracranial activity both in treatment-naive patients with ALK-positive non-small-cell lung cancer, and in those who had progressed on crizotinib, second-generation ALK tyrosine kinase inhibitors, or after up to three previous ALK tyrosine kinase inhibitors. Thus, lorlatinib could represent an effective treatment option for patients with ALK-positive non-small-cell lung cancer in first-line or subsequent therapy. Pfizer.

Lung toxicity is a potential fatal effect involving non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) patients exposed to tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs). Moving from our experience regarding a patient who developed lung toxicity while receiving 2 different anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK)-TKIs, we performed a systematic review to assess the epidemiologic magnitude and the clinical significance of such toxicity in NSCLC patients treated with ALK-TKIs. Studies were identified using MEDLINE and additional sources (European Society for Medical Oncology, American Society of Clinical Oncology, and World Conference on Lung Cancer abstracts) in agreement with Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses and Cochrane guidelines. Lung toxicity was reported in 105 of 4943 NSCLC patients (2.1%). Crizotinib was responsible for pulmonary adverse events (AEs) in 1.8% of exposed patients (49 of 2706). With the limit of a lower number of treated patients (n = 359), brigatinib resulted as the most frequently involved in lung toxicity (7%; n = 25). Pulmonary AEs during therapy with ceritinib, alectinib, and lorlatinib occurred in 1.1%, 2.6%, and 1.8% of the patients, respectively. Sixty-five percent of cases accounted for Grade 3 or 4 events, with a mortality rate of 9%. Radiological patterns of pneumonia were reported in 25 patients, whereas imaging evocative of interstitial lung disease in 37. Overall, 26 of 105 patients (25%) permanently discontinued treatment because of lung toxicity. Lung toxicity is a rare albeit potentially severe side effect in NSCLC patients receiving ALK-TKIs, apparently more frequent with brigatinib. Its early recognition and treatment are crucial for the best outcome of this subgroup of patients, whose overall prognosis is being improved by the availability of several targeted agents.
